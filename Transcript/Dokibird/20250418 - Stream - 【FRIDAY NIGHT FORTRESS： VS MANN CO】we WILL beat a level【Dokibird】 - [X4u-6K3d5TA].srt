1
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,450
Hello, buddy.

2
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:51,870
Hello.

3
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,110
Hello.

4
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,110
Well,

5
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,670
I'm not a person today.

6
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:07,850
As always, welcome to the 1230 Streams.

7
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,490
Wow, yippee.

8
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,750
It is.

9
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,190
Okay, I turned it down.

10
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,770
Let me just turn it all the way down.

11
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,050
You don't need to listen to that game.

12
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,410
You don't need to listen to me.

13
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,630
Okay, give me a sec.

14
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,430
I'm not okay right now.

15
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,650
As always, at 1230, I'm never okay.

16
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,990
I just realized I forgot to...

17
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,170
I forgot to eat something real quick.

18
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,150
Well, I'm not eating any food at the moment because it's 1230.

19
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,990
Yippee.

20
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,790
I'll just eat right after the 1230 streams.

21
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,130
But I'll need to get that, you know, the throat...

22
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,630
The Chinese throat medicine thingy.

23
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,270
I forgot what it's called.

24
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,510
Because I made two streams today, I should get one of that for today's stream.

25
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,110
I'll be right back.

26
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,810
That's fine.

27
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,590
I clearly just...

28
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,890
I literally just started.

29
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,990
I'll be right back.

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,930
Give me five minutes.

31
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,890
I told you...

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,510
It was less than five minutes.

33
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,750
Whoa!

34
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,790
Also, you're gonna hear some squeaky noises because I bought Dad a new toy.

35
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,870
So, like, just to keep him occupied and, like...

36
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,310
Not depressed, you know?

37
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,710
Alright.

38
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,530
Let me... Let me...

39
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,270
Get this...

40
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,210
Not medicine.

41
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,390
This...

42
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,790
Thing in my mouth.

43
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,090
Good morning, Doki.

44
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,550
Good morning, Homo.

45
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,090
Thank you for the super chat.

46
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,190
Thank you, thank you.

47
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,810
Right.

48
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,530
Thank you for the super chat.

49
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,870
Thank you, thank you.

50
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,150
Good morning, Doki.

51
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,210
You sound trippier ass.

52
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:09,730
Thank you.

53
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,790
I mean, this is the...

54
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,610
The most happiest I've ever sounded at 1230 in the morning.

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,620
Sorry, I'm making sure...

56
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,820
Okay, it's the...

57
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,140
Nin...

58
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,700
Ninjong Pei Pa Koa.

59
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,660
I like how I pronounce that in the most fucking English accent ever.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,180
Even though I'm Chinese...

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,560
Like...

62
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,840
I know Chinese.

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,440
Chinese...

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,220
The Chinese part of my brain has not...

65
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,800
Like...

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,840
Been activated...

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,300
For some reason.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh...

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm...

70
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,140
I'm...

71
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,980
Like...

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,580
I just...

73
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,800
I just...

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,780
Went full on English accent on that.

75
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,340
In the most non-Asian way possible.

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,320
I think if I spoke in a Chinese accent or like, you know, not Chinese accent because it's literally Chinese.

77
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,380
I read this in a more Chinese way of speaking.

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't even know.

79
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,000
Sorry, I don't think it's activated right now.

80
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,140
I don't know.

81
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,220
I don't know if this is Koa.

82
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,060
I don't know.

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,760
I might be pronouncing it horribly wrong.

84
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,380
I was like, the fuck is this?

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,760
How do I make Koa sound like Chinese?

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
I don't know.

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
I'm reading the English pronunciation.

88
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm like, I don't fucking know.

89
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm too tired.

90
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,300
All right, this way.

91
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:05,900
Okay.

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:16,380
My voice sounds a little bit better now because I just, um, I just had, uh, just did the, I just ingested that.

93
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:22,780
So now I sound less dead inside, but it won't fix how I feel, how I actually feel.

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,920
It's like a little Band-Aid.

95
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,740
Did you guys know that Minecraft created green milk?

96
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,860
Sorry, I didn't know how to, I didn't know how to, like, uh, segue into it.

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,720
So I'm just gonna drop that in.

98
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,700
You know how?

99
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,180
It's just out of nowhere.

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,460
Did you know that Minecraft made creeper milk?

101
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,260
And I thought it was so, like, I don't know.

102
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:57,700
I feel like it was so unfortunately named, uh, that it was, it was named, uh, creeper milk.

103
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,320
Yes, so I'm assuming, like, did they milk some creepers?

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,420
I should have talked about this yesterday.

105
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,300
Did they milk some creepers to get creeper milk?

106
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:17,680
So if you Google image, um, you just gotta Google image, uh, uh, uh, uh, creeper milk, and then you'll, you'll get it.

107
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,300
But don't worry, you don't have to Google image creeper milk, because I can show you what it looks like, the convenience of being a streamer.

108
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:35,840
So yeah, so, it's literally milk that's green, and then it's called vanilla, yeah, I, I don't understand why it's called creeper milk.

109
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:45,780
And why, I don't, they just call it Minecraft milk, um, because then it just implies that you're milking the creeper.

110
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:53,240
Like, you're, like, you're, like, Phil, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, intruder alert.

111
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,500
There's a red spy in the bay, oh my, I do sound so much more alive now.

112
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,600
But in the inside, I am still dead inside, so, um, but that's okay, as long as my outside is alright.

113
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Alright, I...

114
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,300
Guys, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

115
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,940
I bet the hazard pay for milking creepers is pretty good.

116
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,820
Yeah, that's, like, then it's, like, makes me think, like, what are the logistics of milking a creeper?

117
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,380
Like, because it, they sizzle, right?

118
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:32,300
So, like, I assume you have to build an automated, an automated machine, so, like, you won't die from, like, being there.

119
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:42,240
But then you have to, I guess you push the creeper into a cart, and then you push it into the automated machine, so it automates milking a creeper to get the milk that you want.

120
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,980
But then, like, there's no automated machine to milk cows.

121
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,180
So, it's, like, Minecraft has to...

122
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,000
So, then, like, so, because, like, why couldn't it just be, like, Minecraft cow milk?

123
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,940
Why does it have to be creeper?

124
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,000
Like, how do, how do creepers lack...

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,820
I mean, I assume that it's, like, under there.

126
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
Like, we don't see it.

127
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
I assume...

128
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,780
I know they've made, like, other...

129
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,200
Wait, okay.

130
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,800
Uh, true...

131
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,280
Moo...

132
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,720
Milk.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,460
I see...

134
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,120
They said they made, like, other colors.

135
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,520
Because they're, like, oh, it's the same company that made...

136
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,420
Blank.

137
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,000
I was, like...

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,820
Made what?

139
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,080
What else have they made?

140
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,020
Oh, they made blue milk!

141
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,260
They made the...

142
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,620
The Star Wars blue milk.

143
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,520
So...

144
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,580
So, they've done that.

145
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,960
So, they're, like, you know what would be even better than blue milk?

146
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,220
Creeper milk.

147
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,720
But it's literally just milk that's...

148
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,700
I didn't know...

149
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,340
You can just dye the color of milk and it'll be okay.

150
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,160
Because, like...

151
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,020
I assumed that, like...

152
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,640
I know, like...

153
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,160
Oh, wait, did they ever make Shrek milk?

154
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:01,980
I know...

155
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,020
Wait, Shrek...

156
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,280
Oh, they did!

157
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,620
Yeah!

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,220
Oh, yeah!

159
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,000
Nesquik!

160
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,400
Nesquik did something like that.

161
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,940
Okay, but that green looks, like...

162
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,740
It looks wrong.

163
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,180
Okay.

164
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,080
Like, at least, like, Creeper milk looks okay.

165
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,600
But Shrek milk looks...

166
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
Really wrong.

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,780
No, I remembered...

168
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:29,820
I remembered watching a video that talked about all the different products Shrek has done.

169
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,020
Because it was, like, you know, capitalism, yeah.

170
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,140
And they won...

171
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,580
At one point, they talked about, like, Shrek milk.

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,480
And, like...

173
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,640
I would say...

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,480
This looks incredibly wrong.

175
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,360
I...

176
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,500
Especially when they called it Shrek's milk.

177
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,180
Because then, you know, you could...

178
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,440
It looks...

179
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,620
Where did they get this?

180
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,640
It looks...

181
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,320
It looks very wrong.

182
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,840
Zybo, thank you, Liz.

183
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,300
Super chat.

184
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:03,720
Thank you.

185
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Thank you.

186
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,440
Dirty, I just got here.

187
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm worried.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,520
The hell are you talking?

189
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,100
I'm just talking about milk, guys.

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,920
Also, like...

191
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,620
Am I supposed to drink 1% or 2% milk?

192
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,660
Because, like...

193
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:15,920
I don't know.

194
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,480
I...

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,900
I could never tell.

196
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,800
Why is there different percentages of milk?

197
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,400
Anyway.

198
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,840
JL, thank you for the super chat.

199
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,260
Thank you.

200
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,060
It doesn't matter.

201
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,140
Then why are they separating percentages?

202
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
Why do you...

203
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,560
Oh, it's...

204
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm just, like...

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,100
Why...

206
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,180
Just...

207
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,700
Just...

208
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,980
Why do they separate the milk percentages?

209
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,780
Why is...

210
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,500
Why...

211
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,980
Why...

212
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,720
Why is milk...

213
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,380
Why is milk, like, categorized into different things?

214
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,000
That is not milk.

215
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,680
I don't...

216
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,400
Like...

217
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,820
I can't say what it reminds me of.

218
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,480
Like...

219
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,940
I can't...

220
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,100
I can't really say what it actually looks like.

221
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,280
But it doesn't look like milk.

222
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,140
It doesn't...

223
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,400
I'll just say it.

224
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,420
It doesn't look like milk.

225
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
JL, thank you for the super chat.

226
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,140
JL, thank you, thank you.

227
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,320
Exhausted Doki needs a fluffy comforter and an air conditioner and some hot coal.

228
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,540
That sounds really nice right now.

229
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,060
Thank you for the super chat.

230
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,620
Thank you.

231
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,220
Thank you.

232
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,100
PickleCucumber.

233
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,260
Thank you for the super chat.

234
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,280
I'm just going to leave it on screen for now while I read these super chats.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,260
JL, he has me invested in a method of milking creepers.

236
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,120
My, Oship.

237
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,160
Thank you for the super chat.

238
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,520
Thank you.

239
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,220
Thank you.

240
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,260
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

241
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,120
Thank you, thank you.

242
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,400
Look Shrek in the eye in the bag as you ask why the milk is yellow.

243
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,780
D-Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

244
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,860
Thank you, thank you.

245
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,740
So when is... Alright, I'm not finished reading that D-Dragon.

246
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
Pebble, thank you for the super chat.

247
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,280
Thank you, thank you.

248
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,740
I just came from the clip about you and Milk talking about being lactose intolerant to open the stream and immediately be hit with creeper lactation.

249
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,700
Thank you for the super chat.

250
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,780
Thank you, thank you.

251
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh my god, speaking of lactose intolerant, apparently, I read that, um, I read, like, you guys were talking about it in my comment sections on that vibe.

252
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:31,940
And I read that someone was saying that, like, we develop lactose intolerance, like, um, as we get older.

253
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:40,760
So I thought that was, and then, like, apparently it's a thing that almost every mammals do, that people, they just started becoming lactose intolerant.

254
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,140
as they get older, just to, like, discourage them from taking all the milk from babies.

255
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,740
I was like, what the...

256
00:13:50,220 --> 00:14:02,240
So if it wasn't for our lactose intolerance, we would not be, I guess we won't be drinking milk out of gardens anymore.

257
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,920
So, I mean, I guess that makes sense.

258
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,440
But then, like, The thing is, I also know that, like, um...

259
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,020
I guess, like, okay, so, for those who don't know, I've talked about this before, but, uh...

260
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,820
Uh...

261
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,560
Sorry, child!

262
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Daddy needs his milkies!

263
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,140
That's a wild sentence!

264
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,880
Um...

265
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,380
But that's where my mind was going towards it.

266
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,080
It's true!

267
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

268
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,960
Ha, hahh...

269
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,460
Ha, ha fø, ha, ha!

270
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,880
Ha, ha, ha...

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,360
Ha... ha, ha, ha...

272
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Ha, ha ha...

273
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,040
Ha, ha, ha...

274
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Ha, ha하, ha...

275
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,680
Anyway...

276
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,480
Um... I talked about it before, but for those who don't know, um, there's a...

277
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,460
Um, there's a higher, uh...

278
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:02,120
There's a higher chance for Asians to be, like, lactose intolerant than it is for, like, others.

279
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,580
Because, like, I think it was, like, something how, like, we didn't grow up.

280
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,200
Like, milk was not as common in Asia as it was for the rest of the world.

281
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,660
And that's why, like, they introduced, like, banana milk.

282
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,720
Because it was a way to get more people to drink milk back then.

283
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:30,460
And just because, like, a lot of Asians had a bigger tendency to develop lactose intolerance versus, like, the rest of the people around the world.

284
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,360
And that means the people around the rest of the world were bigger freaks than us.

285
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,420
If you think about it.

286
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:48,540
Because we were, you know, we were, like, we're not drinking milk after we're out of babies.

287
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,940
But then the rest of the world was, like, I need my milkies.

288
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:05,240
And you, like, forced through your genetic coding to be able to keep drinking milk.

289
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,600
I need my milkies.

290
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,420
Because then, that also means that you guys were, like, the rest, like I said, you guys.

291
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,340
Because I'm Asian.

292
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm, like, I'm not a freak.

293
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,100
My ancestors were not freaks.

294
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,420
Yippee.

295
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,420
My ancestors were not freaks.

296
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,340
But I'm not lactose intolerant.

297
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,620
So, like, maybe part of my ancestry had freaks in there.

298
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:57,120
So, like, back then, back then, some of them were, like, I refuse to be lactose intolerant.

299
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,460
I shall have my milkies.

300
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,600
And then you found a cow and was, like, I'm drinking.

301
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:12,420
You're, like, you found a cow and you're just, like, if he can drink the milkies, I can drink the milkies.

302
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,980
That's crazy.

303
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,340
That's crazy.

304
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,680
They have...

305
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,920
Um.

306
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,100
Uh.

307
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,940
Let's see.

308
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,600
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

309
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,460
Rag, thank you for the super chat.

310
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,540
Thank you, thank you.

311
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:30,980
Uh.

312
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,520
I was diagnosed with being lactose intolerant last week.

313
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,180
After 34 years of drinking milk.

314
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,020
So sad.

315
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,080
Thank you for the super chat.

316
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:39,860
Thank you, thank you.

317
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,620
I mean, I don't have lactose intolerant.

318
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,100
I'm not lactose intolerant.

319
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,040
So, like, I don't know exactly what happens.

320
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:47,760
Uh.

321
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,760
I guess, like, thank you to my ancestors for being freaks.

322
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,040
Uh.

323
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,220
To make sure that I can, uh.

324
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,760
To make sure that, uh.

325
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,080
I can drink it.

326
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,640
Uh.

327
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,590
But, like, um.

328
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,710
Um.

329
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,590
I assume, like, you just go to the bathroom more.

330
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,090
So, it's not, like, that big of a sacrifice.

331
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,790
I feel like.

332
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,370
Like.

333
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,250
Um.

334
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,570
At best, you just be more dehydrated.

335
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,930
So, just drink more water.

336
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,810
Or you could just drink more milk.

337
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,290
Like.

338
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:23,970
Ha ha ha.

339
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,390
I just.

340
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,550
Ha ha ha.

341
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,130
Yeah.

342
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,550
Oh.

343
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,050
Or more.

344
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,410
Okay.

345
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,010
I guess the stomach pain is not the best either.

346
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:32,630
Uh.

347
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,350
So.

348
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,350
Oh.

349
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,750
Oh.

350
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,310
Oh.

351
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:35,670
Doki.

352
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,570
You also forgot the intense pain.

353
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,550
Um.

354
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,050
Oh, yeah.

355
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,570
That seems.

356
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,110
Well.

357
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,290
What if you just get.

358
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:42,830
Okay.

359
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,370
Okay.

360
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,870
What do we do pre-prep.

361
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,550
Pre-prep it before you.

362
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,230
You drink milk.

363
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:48,830
Like, you know.

364
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,530
Like.

365
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,990
You get Tylenol.

366
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,510
Or, like, painkillers.

367
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,710
Anytime painkillers.

368
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,410
You pop in a painkiller.

369
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,950
And then you just drink them.

370
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,310
And then you wait until it.

371
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,770
You know.

372
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,570
Just take into effect.

373
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,190
And then you just start chugging milk down.

374
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:03,490
Like.

375
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,050
Wouldn't that.

376
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,010
Wouldn't that work?

377
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,670
Or then.

378
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,670
And then.

379
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,530
Tummy hurt.

380
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,310
Just use.

381
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:11,830
Wait.

382
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,310
Oh, yeah.

383
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,230
Lactate.

384
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,530
The.

385
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:13,810
Like.

386
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,530
The thing that.

387
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,430
Um.

388
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,710
You mean purposely.

389
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,010
No.

390
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,650
I meant like.

391
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:17,990
You know.

392
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,750
If you're really craving for milk.

393
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,630
Um.

394
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,290
Just chuck a pill in.

395
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,650
And then you just drink it.

396
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:24,930
Like.

397
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,330
You can't.

398
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,930
Like.

399
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,190
It's.

400
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,490
You know.

401
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,170
It's not like.

402
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,230
It's the end of the world.

403
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,370
But yeah.

404
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:37,610
That's.

405
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,450
I thought that was.

406
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,810
I thought that was pretty interesting.

407
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,350
Like.

408
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,730
Fun milk facts.

409
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,010
Guys.

410
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,210
Anton.

411
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,110
Thank you for the super chat.

412
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,470
Thank you.

413
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:45,930
Thank you.

414
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,310
Lubu drank his milkies.

415
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,630
That's why he grew up.

416
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,590
Big and strong.

417
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,850
Thank you for the super chat.

418
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,190
Thank you.

419
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:51,790
Thank you.

420
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,310
Robbins.

421
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,210
Thank you for the super chat.

422
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:53,630
Thank you.

423
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,050
Thank you.

424
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,070
You have to put in work to be a freak.

425
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,930
Thank you for the super chat.

426
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,790
Thank you, thank you.

427
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,790
Our ancestors didn't suck on cow, did he?

428
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,880
Well, not mine, apparently.

429
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,840
But... not mine, because I can safely consume milk.

430
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,660
Solid.

431
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,860
Thank you for the super chat.

432
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,920
Thank you, thank you.

433
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,760
Funny how yesterday's stream brought many curse topic.

434
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
Classy, dokiest moment.

435
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,700
Can't wait for the next two parts.

436
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,700
Thank you for the super chat.

437
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,560
Thank you, thank you.

438
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,240
Don't kink shame our ancestors.

439
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,260
I mean...

440
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,700
I mean...

441
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,640
Look, I'm not kink shaming...

442
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Look, I'm kink shaming my ancestors.

443
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,580
And I think they'll be okay with it.

444
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,600
I think...

445
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,120
Um...

446
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,600
Um...

447
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,920
Adria, thank you for the super chat.

448
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,800
Thank you, thank you.

449
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,600
Uh...

450
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,280
What?

451
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm just saying...

452
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm not being racist.

453
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm talking about milk facts.

454
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,120
Because I'm saying that like...

455
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,040
How come...

456
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,620
Like...

457
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,400
Um...

458
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,080
A reason why Asians...

459
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,740
A lot of Asians get lactose intolerant...

460
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,080
Is because they're not used to drinking milk.

461
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,040
Because it...

462
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,940
Milk wasn't like a common thing.

463
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,180
Uh...

464
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,260
Milk and like...

465
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,420
Dairy products wasn't common in Asia.

466
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,460
So I'm just saying...

467
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,560
That like...

468
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,240
But what...

469
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,620
If...

470
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,160
You know...

471
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,840
You know the rest of the world drink a lot of milk.

472
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,520
Some...

473
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,840
I...

474
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,740
I'm saying...

475
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,260
Well...

476
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,620
But the rest of the world...

477
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,660
They were ingesting milk...

478
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,260
Left and...

479
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,620
That's why...

480
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,540
I'm saying guys...

481
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,820
Um...

482
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,620
Oh yeah, oh yeah, because the Mongolians, the Mongolians drank a lot of milk too, right?

483
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,720
So like, so like the Mongolians, basically, oh my god, maybe, oh wait, that's not a good thought.

484
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:28,700
Like, there's, there's, there's only, there's only one reason why I would have, like, partial Mongolian ancestry.

485
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,340
There's, there's, I just realized that's not a good thing.

486
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:43,120
There's, there's, um, Betty, thank you for the super chat.

487
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,860
Thank you, thank you.

488
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,640
The same as most of us, right?

489
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,580
Um, since you're not lactose intolerant, does that mean your ancestors drank everyone else's milk in Asia?

490
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:14,780
Yeah, well, if I have, like, Mongolian ancestry, um, which is, like, a lot of, a lot of people, um, in China, um, then that means it's because, like, my ancestor just drank horse milk.

491
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,400
Because I guess they're like, fuck water.

492
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:29,760
They, they have a lot of horses, so, um, um, they have a lot of horses, so, like, I won't be surprised.

493
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,240
Also, give me a sec, I need to, like, register for this real quick.

494
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Um, so, like, uh, but, but, but, I need to register for, wait, they just lifted it, right?

495
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,700
Okay, exciting news, we are removing NDA restrictions.

496
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,240
Oh, okay.

497
00:23:46,740 --> 00:24:03,080
All right, so, um, so, you know how, like, Marathon, look, guys, lucky for you, lucky for you, uh, uh, uh, I can change the topic because I just got pinged for something, which is Marathon.

498
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,560
Um, so, you guys know how Bungie is developing a new game?

499
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,740
Uh, like, literally, they just pinged everyone and be like, oh, any, any restrictions have now been removed.

500
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,560
Yeah, so, um, I received, like, a creator care package from Marathon.

501
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,720
I was so confused because I was like, what the fuck is it?

502
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:31,040
Because, like, okay, the box itself of the creator package of the Marathon box, I got it, like, two days ago.

503
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:40,720
I was so confused because I forgot that they asked me about it, like, because they asked me if they, they, they were, they wanted to send this to me, like, three months ago.

504
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,780
And I forgot about it because it was three months ago.

505
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:55,400
So, so, I received the box for Marathon and, and, like, there was no branding that it was for Marathon.

506
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,740
It had, like, it had, like, the most cryptic shit ever on the box and inside the box.

507
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,160
I was so fucking confused.

508
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,820
I was like, what is this?

509
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,240
I was like, who sent this to me?

510
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,700
And, because I sent it to, like, um, I sent my address, uh, since it was, like, a game package.

511
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,000
So, I said, I'm okay with sending it to my address.

512
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,480
Um, and then, so, in the box, it says, you will not, what was it?

513
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,840
Something escaped, you will not escape God or something.

514
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,160
Okay.

515
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,280
You will, okay, escape God.

516
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,100
Okay.

517
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,060
I need to remember that quote, what, what that quote was.

518
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,000
It was, it was so, oh, escape will make me God.

519
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,160
I was so, it was just plastered everywhere.

520
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,600
Like, escape will make me God.

521
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,500
And I was like, the fuck is this?

522
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,340
Like, I was so confused.

523
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,980
I was like, what is, what is this package that I received?

524
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,680
So, I had to Google it.

525
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,640
And, obviously, it led me to a marathon.

526
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,300
I was like, what's the fuck?

527
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,800
Why do I have a, oh, yeah, it's that game that's coming out soon.

528
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,160
And there's, like, early access.

529
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,520
And so, um, I looked at our emails, my business email.

530
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,080
And, apparently, um, eight days, nine days ago, they sent me an email to the creator discord server.

531
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,920
And I was, and I, whoops, I missed out on, like, a lot of stuff.

532
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,780
So, after now, I have to sign up.

533
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,280
Because, like, if I joined at the time that I was supposed to join, I would guarantee an early access code.

534
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,620
But because I, you know, I, I didn't realize they sent me the, uh, creator discord.

535
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,260
Um, I have to, um, I have to sign up for it now.

536
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,040
So, it's not guaranteed, though.

537
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,820
Uh, it's not actually guaranteed.

538
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,420
Because I didn't co-stream the reveal or whatever.

539
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:54,800
Because you're supposed to co-stream the reveal to guarantee a, or co-stream the reveal or talk about it to guarantee an early access code.

540
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,440
And then I was like, oopsie.

541
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,360
So, but I'm still in the discord server.

542
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,920
And they did send me a care package for it.

543
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,860
So, I just need a, um, I just need a, uh, see if I can get it by applying.

544
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,660
So, we'll be coming soon for those that have, that filled out the survey.

545
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,560
Okay, please.

546
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,440
Okay, I did it.

547
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,220
I filled it out.

548
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,560
Yay.

549
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,140
Yay.

550
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,860
Um.

551
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,800
Um, I heard that, um, I heard that, like, I don't know, it's an extraction shooter.

552
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,120
But it is developed by Bungie, who've made, like, what?

553
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,640
They made Destiny, right?

554
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,140
That's the, yeah, yeah, that they made Destiny and everything.

555
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,640
So, it can't be that bad.

556
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:46,060
I think the only thing is that, the only thing I'm like, eh, is the fact that, um, oh, and Halo, too.

557
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,500
They did Halo, and, yeah, they made Halo and Destiny.

558
00:27:49,500 --> 00:28:04,080
And, like, the only issue I have with, with Marathon is the fact that, um, it's, uh, it's the fact that, like, it is a partial, a partial extraction shooter.

559
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,840
And I'm, like, really done.

560
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:13,100
I'm so done with video games doing extraction shooters as, like, their new job.

561
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:24,740
It's, like, the new Battle Royale, but I feel like, even then, I feel like Battle Royale has, um, has made, has more people playing versus extraction shooters.

562
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:36,360
So, I don't know, I just feel like, I just feel like, at least Battle Royale had a bigger player base versus, like, Battle Royale type games have bigger player base than extraction shooters.

563
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Extraction shooters die faster.

564
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,100
But yeah, I'm just really done with extraction shooters and stuff.

565
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,780
So we'll see how it goes.

566
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,720
But people were like, no, no, no.

567
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,400
Marathon is different.

568
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,640
It's gonna be different.

569
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,660
They're gonna add a twist to it.

570
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,020
And I'm just thinking like, that's all extraction shooters.

571
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,740
Every extraction shooter right now that's coming out is basically extraction shooter, but a twist.

572
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,180
That's all of them!

573
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,300
Like, what do you mean?

574
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,940
How would this be different?

575
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,880
They all say that.

576
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,660
And they all still die.

577
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,980
Jakato, thank you for the super chat.

578
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,440
Thank you.

579
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,100
Thank you.

580
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,720
It's the same picture.

581
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:36,380
Also speaking of Marathon, the OG Marathon trilogy recently released on Steam for free, with Steam Workshop.

582
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,880
Support good pre-Halo bungee shooter.

583
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,560
Thank you for the super chat, Jakato.

584
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:41,720
Thank you.

585
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,340
Thank you.

586
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,220
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

587
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,560
Thank you.

588
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,100
Thank you.

589
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,940
When you play a pony game, that was Genghis Khan smiling on his descendant as a freaking act.

590
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,760
Thank you for the super chat.

591
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,080
Thank you.

592
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,480
Thank you.

593
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:08,980
Oh my god, speaking of ponies, did you know that, like, My Little Pony has, like, a second resurgence, but only in China?

594
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,420
I think it's because, like, they started running the show.

595
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:20,640
I think they started running the show in dubbed, in, like, you know, dubbed Chinese in China.

596
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:27,380
And, like, there's so many new products of, like, My Little Pony, like, dedicated to, like...

597
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:34,700
Yeah, there's, like, it's, like, how, you know, it's, like, how Tom and Jerry is, like, incredibly popular in Asia now.

598
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,080
Versus, like, you know, the rest of the world.

599
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,820
And, like, it's happening to, like, My Little Pony at the moment.

600
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:47,220
Like, My Little Pony is getting incredibly popular in Asia, specifically in China.

601
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,420
And there's, like, they've released, like, exclusive Chinese merch.

602
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,920
Just, you can only get in China or, like, get expensive, like, overseas shipment to you.

603
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:07,880
But it's, like, there's, like, yeah, they released a TCG of My Little Pony, but it's only in Chinese.

604
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,700
Like, that's how popular it is.

605
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,960
Like, an entirely new TCG is being made in China.

606
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,740
I was, like, I saw, like, lots of, like, merch pictures of it.

607
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,240
Because people were, like, you know, the bronies were, like, I'm happy for you.

608
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,960
But, like, you know, the mad emoji, like this one.

609
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,320
They're, like, they're, like, they're, like, I'm happy for you.

610
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:56,480
And there's, like, a ton of, there's, like, a ton of really, like, really good merch just specifically released there.

611
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,200
Um, so I thought, like, like, even, like, plushies and...

612
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,380
And they're higher quality.

613
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:11,600
I think the most, the most fucked up part is that it's incredibly higher quality than whatever the fuck Hasbro has released in NA.

614
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,760
Okay, I'll do a comparison.

615
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,060
I'll show you guys a comparison.

616
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,540
So, um, so, okay.

617
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:25,400
So, you know, like, NA TCG cards, they're mostly, like, screenshots of the shows.

618
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,640
Uh, so, like, they're...

619
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,520
Yeah, Hasbro is Hasbro.

620
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,860
So, here's a comparison.

621
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,600
So, you can tell, like...

622
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,000
So, this is, like, TCG for an NA.

623
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,340
So, they're mostly always done.

624
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,940
They're mostly, like...

625
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,080
This is what I hate about, like, TCGs based off of, like, shows and stuff.

626
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,660
Is that they just use screenshots.

627
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,140
So, this is, like, the regular TCG.

628
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,300
And then, like, in China, they actually use, like...

629
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,840
The China TCG of My Little Pony.

630
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I almost said My Little Brony.

631
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,620
They use, like, actual original art.

632
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:06,700
Okay.

633
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:12,020
Yeah, so, it's, like, you can tell, like, the difference between, like, the quality of the...

634
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,240
So, yeah.

635
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,600
Oh, what the...

636
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,620
So, yeah.

637
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,020
There's, like, actual...

638
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,680
Like, they actually hired artists to make original art.

639
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,340
For, like, the trading cards.

640
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,900
So, you can tell the quality is a lot different.

641
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,660
So, people...

642
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,100
So, all, like, the NA fans are just, like...

643
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm happy for you.

644
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,240
But, you know they're not happy.

645
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,680
You know...

646
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,480
You know they're not happy at all.

647
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,740
I thought it was incredibly interesting.

648
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,220
It was, like...

649
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,900
It was crazy.

650
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,440
I looked at the merch and I was just, like...

651
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,840
Wait, that's, like...

652
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,900
That's actually, like...

653
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,860
Like, good merch.

654
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,920
Because Hasbro...

655
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,780
Hasbro...

656
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,240
Okay, the thing about Hasbro is that...

657
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,880
You know how, like, they make...

658
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,080
You know, they make shows out of their products?

659
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,020
But the thing is...

660
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,040
They want to make sure it looks like the molds that they have.

661
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,960
So, they can reuse the molds...

662
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,240
Over and over and over again.

663
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,040
For, like, you know, peak profits.

664
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,560
So, they just, like, use the same molds and everything.

665
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,500
And they just, like, change one or two little things.

666
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,140
And then...

667
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,500
So, they do that for Transformers.

668
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,740
They do that for...

669
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,600
Transformers.

670
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,560
They do that for Barbie.

671
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,160
They do that for, like...

672
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,040
You know, uh...

673
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,700
Mild Pony.

674
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,120
And they don't, like...

675
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,820
For majority of their properties.

676
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,460
Like, the reason why...

677
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,540
For He-Man...

678
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,800
Like, back then...

679
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,660
Like, where all the characters looked the same.

680
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,260
You know, like, the figures and everything.

681
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,880
Like, the...

682
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,620
The guys are all, like...

683
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:09,720
Super buff men, and then the women are like super sexy and everything, but like the same build.

684
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,600
It's because they use two molds.

685
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,900
Guy mold and woman mold.

686
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,360
And they just make new accessories.

687
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,320
That's really it.

688
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,800
They all look the same.

689
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,740
It's just they have different hair or different accessories.

690
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,920
Because it's all... they only have two molds.

691
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,460
It's male-female.

692
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
And so like they do that.

693
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,240
So even now they do that for like the newer property.

694
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,520
Like they haven't changed in their ways.

695
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,500
And so like... so that's why like, you know, they put a lot less effort when it comes to...

696
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,440
when it comes to merch.

697
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,680
Because they know children don't really care.

698
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,960
Like, it's true though.

699
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,420
Like, kids don't really care.

700
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:13,880
If a kid... also like in today's world, if a child buys an actual toy, that's a success there already.

701
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,460
Like, I... I... I... I don't think children play toys anymore.

702
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,480
If you get a child to buy an actual toy...

703
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,080
then like, congratulations, you made it.

704
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,940
Like...

705
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,120
So... so... I feel like... like...

706
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:38,860
Um, they are putting even less effort due to the fact that, um, who buys toys anymore?

707
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,020
They are better than iPads, no, 100%.

708
00:36:43,020 --> 00:37:00,080
It's just that we live in a day and age where a child would not play a toy, uh, would not want to play toys because, like, their parents are, some parents are, like, super lazy and they just give them an iPad, even though, like, okay, you know, okay, I'm jumping through.

709
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,760
I just realized I've been talking for, whoops, I've been talking for 48 minutes!

710
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,760
I haven't played the game yet!

711
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,760
Oh, alright, this is the last topic.

712
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:20,660
Um, but, like, people don't realize because, okay, so, like, the earlier, when iPads first came out, you know, people were like, oh, it won't hurt the child if I make them look at iPads and everything.

713
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:38,660
But, like, obviously, there's not no data to, to actually research into the effects of giving a child an iPad and what happens to the brain to the child's development when they keep watching the, when they watch the screen.

714
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:52,160
So, like, now, after, like, 10 plus years, we actually finally have data on what happens when you provide children with electronics at an earlier age.

715
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,340
And who would have thought it actually stops development?

716
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:11,340
It actually hinders, um, development for the brain because you don't have, you know, a child's brain, uh, like, the brain is being developed the most when you're a child.

717
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:18,160
And who would have thought, if you give your child an iPad, it actually slows down development?

718
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:29,460
And, and, um, it actually affects, like, attention span and everything.

719
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,280
So, you know, not the greatest.

720
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,340
It's just, like, Ozempic, where, uh, you know, people were like, no, it's so fine.

721
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,840
People were like, it's okay to use Ozempic.

722
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:53,720
Uh, the only side effects, you know, because there's not enough data right now or, or years to actually calculate what the actual long-term effects it is for, for Ozempic.

723
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,040
And people were like, it's okay, guys.

724
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Oh, the only side effects of Ozempic is that you don't eat as much.

725
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,540
But now, like, data is already coming in.

726
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,080
Uh.

727
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:16,120
This is already coming in, where, like, um, some of the effects of Ozempic is not...

728
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,260
It's not very good side effects.

729
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,000
Ozempic hasn't been around?

730
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,680
Nope, yes, but then they weren't using it as a diet drug.

731
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,900
That's the thing.

732
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,020
They were used for, like, diabetics and other, like, ill sicknesses.

733
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,620
But now, it's people without diabetes are using it.

734
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:47,220
And people, they don't have enough data on what happens to people who are not diabetic and are using Ozempic.

735
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,720
It's actually, like, crazy that people are just, you know, stabbing themselves with a needle.

736
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,760
Just because they're like, okay, but I get to be skinnier.

737
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:14,980
Like, never, exactly, never be the first one to try anything related to medical, to medical items.

738
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,220
Um, but all for collecting data, guys!

739
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,700
Woo!

740
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,770
Data time!

741
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,290
Alright.

742
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,590
Anyway.

743
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,470
Anyway, time to actually play the game.

744
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,430
Yippee!

745
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:39,910
But yeah, it's actually crazy that, like, Um, people didn't, people are like, let's give children iPads.

746
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,150
And we'll see how it goes.

747
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,290
Whoa, surprise!

748
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:48,810
Surprise!

749
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,370
They developed, they did not develop well.

750
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,270
Alright, anyway.

751
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,430
Yay!

752
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,530
Okay, so I don't know how long this is gonna take for me.

753
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:03,270
Uh, how long this is gonna take for me to complete this game.

754
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,990
For those who don't know, Friday Night Fortress vs.

755
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,030
Manco.

756
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,910
Um, is a Friday Night Funkin' mod.

757
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:22,690
I played this mod last time when I was playing my own fan-made mod, the Tomato Funkin', and then, like, I finished it, and then I was just like, alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look at different mods, because I still have time.

758
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,690
And, this is, this, this one was incredibly hard.

759
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:33,830
Um, it was incredibly hard, and I did not complete a single level.

760
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,770
And, because there is no difficulty slider for this game.

761
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,370
There is no, there was no difficulty slider.

762
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,330
So, I'm actually going straight up playing on hard mode.

763
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:51,270
So, I end the stream, the moment I beat one singular level.

764
00:41:51,270 --> 00:42:04,370
Uh, I swear to God, if I beat this level within 20 minutes, after talking for, like, 45 minutes, they'll be like, wow, Doki did struggle for it, and then they'll just see me on the fucking screen for 45 minutes, and then...

765
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:11,470
And then the game, like, and then they're like, wait, she's not even playing the game.

766
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,410
No, I told myself, I will only, I will stop after I beat one level.

767
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,290
Like, I can't, I...

768
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,030
This game...

769
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,810
This game made me rage so hard.

770
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,450
I don't think...

771
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,110
I cannot...

772
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,290
I cannot do more than one.

773
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,810
Alright, let me...

774
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,290
I hope the volume is okay.

775
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,310
I did look at my...

776
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,250
Soundgat might need your help with checking the volume for this later.

777
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,970
Uh, or, like, soon.

778
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,690
Alright, free play unlocked.

779
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:43,930
Okay.

780
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,410
Demoman was the easiest.

781
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,630
I need to get warmed up for this.

782
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,090
Alright.

783
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,450
Oh, shit.

784
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,010
What the fuck?

785
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,390
I actually almost joined the Discord.

786
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,290
It always...

787
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,130
Almost...

788
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,470
Gets me into the Discord.

789
00:42:59,610 --> 00:42:59,910
Almost.

790
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,490
How do I play the game?

791
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,250
Oh, activate.

792
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:02,610
Okay.

793
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,510
When I press space bar, it, like, tries to put me in the Discord.

794
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,770
I was like, no, I don't want to join your goddamn Discord.

795
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,970
No, it wasn't Demoman.

796
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,750
Get me out.

797
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:10,410
Get me...

798
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,450
It was a Demoman.

799
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,730
It was...

800
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,370
It was...

801
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:17,970
Miss Pauling.

802
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,390
Miss Pauling was the easiest.

803
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:19,890
I...

804
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,070
I remember.

805
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,890
I saw him and I was like, no, no, no.

806
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:24,530
No.

807
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,190
Miss Pauling.

808
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:26,430
Yeah.

809
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,250
Alright.

810
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:29,710
I'm ready.

811
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,330
Bump.

812
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:32,950
Bump.

813
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,630
I'm ready.

814
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:36,810
Bump.

815
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,890
Okay, the switcheroo.

816
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,270
The switcheroo was the hardest part.

817
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,470
The switcheroo was the one I struggled the most.

818
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,110
Oh, wait.

819
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:44,830
That's not me.

820
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,430
This is me.

821
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,170
Oh, my God.

822
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,010
Oh, my God.

823
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,910
I can't...

824
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,690
I'm already, like...

825
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,150
Buttons go so fast.

826
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,770
Oh, my

827
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,110
God.

828
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,250
I'm not used to pressing buttons right now.

829
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,490
It's already really fast for me.

830
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,450
I forgot.

831
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,530
The chat is, like, Ashley Team Fortress.

832
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,390
The game experience.

833
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,060
Oh, my God.

834
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,600
This is the easy level, too.

835
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,420
I'm doing okay for the easy level.

836
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,680
Oh, oh, okay.

837
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,100
Never mind.

838
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,700
No, you're right.

839
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,300
Never mind.

840
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,040
Never mind.

841
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,680
I got a little bit too confident.

842
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,280
And the game was like, yeah, bet.

843
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,800
Alright.

844
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,060
Okay, there's Demoman.

845
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,200
Demoman.

846
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,660
Get out!

847
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,320
Leave!

848
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,840
Oh, no.

849
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,780
Not Demoman.

850
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:10,580
Okay.

851
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,010
Ah!

852
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,330
Okay.

853
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,570
I'm not doing okay.

854
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,070
I forgot when Demoman comes in.

855
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,990
Things get really rough.

856
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,230
Please give me lines.

857
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,630
That's the only way I survive.

858
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,110
Oh, no.

859
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,290
I'm not okay right now.

860
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,230
That's the...

861
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:34,430
Oh!

862
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,610
Lines are the only way I can survive.

863
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,170
Lines are the only way I can survive.

864
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,090
Oh, turn down the audio a little bit.

865
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:49,450
Okay.

866
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,710
I'll turn it down.

867
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:52,210
Alright.

868
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,030
Let me know if it's better.

869
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,430
Okay.

870
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,330
I forgot.

871
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,030
Oh, my God.

872
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,410
Yes.

873
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,290
This game.

874
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,350
This game.

875
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,810
This game.

876
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,850
Okay.

877
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:03,930
It's...

878
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,410
It's only Demoman.

879
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,850
It's literally Demoman.

880
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,860
Oh, I...

881
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,640
That's Miss Pauline.

882
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,300
I keep forgetting.

883
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,880
At least the song's really good, too.

884
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,560
It's literally Demoman that makes it harder.

885
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,320
Oh, they just need to give me lines.

886
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,400
Okay.

887
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,380
It's okay.

888
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,280
Alright, sound good.

889
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,040
How's the sound now?

890
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,760
And my fingers have to get warmed up, too, for this game.

891
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,760
Fuck!

892
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,160
Okay.

893
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,860
At least it's not the scout's level.

894
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,140
Scout's level was actually bullshit.

895
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,120
I am not doing that one.

896
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,840
Fuck, three up so high.

897
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,520
Oh boy, I love this chat system.

898
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:55,010
Oh, it's so fast.

899
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,220
Oh no!

900
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,620
How did I do this before?

901
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,830
Okay, I'll move it up a little bit.

902
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,710
I got into the switcherun!

903
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,670
I don't remember how I got it!

904
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,770
My hands are just... my fingers are not...

905
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,450
My fingers are not fast enough right now.

906
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,930
What if I start mashing?

907
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:48,910
Okay, it's not good.

908
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,570
It's like, bad!

909
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,680
Okay.

910
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,100
Okay, it's fine.

911
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,560
It's not as bad now!

912
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,260
Who- who was not- mashing was not it?

913
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,300
Alright, three misses.

914
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,180
Not as- not as bad.

915
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,320
No!

916
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,900
Jesus Christ.

917
00:49:53,220 --> 00:50:01,500
I don't know how fucking rhythm gamers do this daily and they actually like walk out to the arcade and to also do rhythm games.

918
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,560
They go outside.

919
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,820
Rhythm gamers are like a whole new level.

920
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,520
They actually go outside to play their rhythm games sometimes.

921
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,940
How do they do that?

922
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,460
It's fun.

923
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,080
Rhythm gamers are the strongest of us all.

924
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,940
They actually touch grass to play their rhythm games sometimes.

925
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,700
No.

926
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,200
No!

927
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,580
I'm always stuck here.

928
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,940
Okay, I'm locking in.

929
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,440
I'm locking in.

930
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,480
I'm okay with the miss ball in level.

931
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,520
It's just Demoman.

932
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,340
Crap.

933
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,620
The administrator is gonna kill me.

934
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,280
Okay, lock in.

935
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,720
It's literally Demoman.

936
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,780
Someone fucking take him back to Scotland.

937
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,660
He's too drunk.

938
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,720
Okay.

939
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,880
Like I can do it at that speed!

940
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,440
I said like take him back to Scotland to visit his family.

941
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,780
He needs a vacation.

942
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,880
I don't know what you guys thought.

943
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,880
He needs a vacation so he can mellow out.

944
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,080
So that's...

945
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,540
to check him out.

946
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,580
We'll be right back in.

947
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:11,800
We'll

948
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:30,550
be right back in.

949
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,030
Freak!

950
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,270
Psyched out!

951
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:32,770
Oh, fuck!

952
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:33,110
Sorry!

953
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:42,130
I'm just saying what Soldier would say, which is something I shouldn't say.

954
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,610
Guys, I'm just being immersed in the world of TFT.

955
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:01,790
No!

956
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,270
Goddammit!

957
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,150
Stop reading this.

958
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,390
Never say anything Soldier would say.

959
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:14,820
Okay.

960
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:15,860
Okay.

961
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,560
Yeah, but he got a hot wife in the end.

962
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,260
Guys, he got a hot wife and like lots of children.

963
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,560
And they live like in the mines.

964
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,700
How am I getting worse?

965
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,200
Oh, shit.

966
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:50,750
Yeah, and then he got Heavy as a brother-in-law.

967
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,870
Like, that guy made it.

968
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,810
He's made it.

969
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:10,210
Yeah, muscle mommy wife and two children.

970
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,550
And the fact that Heavy is his brother-in-law.

971
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,300
And what does Demoman have afterwards?

972
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:29,580
Nothing.

973
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:30,800
His alcohol.

974
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,200
It's not fair.

975
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:40,860
All I'm saying is that Demoman in the future got nothing.

976
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,960
Other than his one eye.

977
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,140
Oh

978
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,410
my god, this part is so difficult.

979
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,810
He got his alcohol though.

980
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,010
He's beating you.

981
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,610
That's all you need.

982
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,950
Just give me more lines.

983
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,970
That's literally how I can survive.

984
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,250
Also, is the game better now?

985
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,210
Volume one?

986
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:23,070
Sound guess?

987
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,150
No.

988
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,430
It's literally this part!

989
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,120
It's literally the...

990
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,400
Ah!

991
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,260
I cannot get past!

992
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,690
That's always there!

993
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,950
How does the other sound end, boy?

994
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,270
Every single time.

995
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,210
Okay, okay, okay.

996
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,110
Okay, I'm focusing for real this time.

997
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,270
Well, at least this...

998
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,870
At least this song's good, at least.

999
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,570
So I can replay it over and over again.

1000
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,870
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba.

1001
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,730
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum.

1002
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:15,030
I'm locking it, I'm locking it!

1003
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,330
Why can't they give me more lines?!

1004
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,580
Jesus Christ!

1005
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,660
Okay.

1006
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,920
Please let me play!

1007
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,160
I'm losing HP waiting for you, Ms. Pine!

1008
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:10,450
Alright.

1009
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,950
Yeah, I, like, nailed that part.

1010
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,050
It's literally Demoman.

1011
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,970
The milk button ain't enough.

1012
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,230
I want him.

1013
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,770
Most sane Team Fortress 2 player.

1014
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,410
Jesus, no.

1015
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,090
I'm gonna die again.

1016
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:47,950
I'm gonna die again.

1017
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,530
I'm at 20.

1018
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:49,390
I'm gonna die again.

1019
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,370
I'm gonna die again.

1020
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,130
No!

1021
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:55,670
No!

1022
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,190
Get me out of this hurdle!

1023
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,910
The moment I learn this part, it's over.

1024
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,190
Get me out of that area!

1025
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,030
That's the saving spot!

1026
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,210
And this is the easiest!

1027
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:19,230
Release me!

1028
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,240
Oh my god, I looked at chat when I started.

1029
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,780
Locking in now.

1030
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,180
You can't be as out close as you can be me.

1031
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,750
Oh.

1032
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,010
Oh my god.

1033
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,190
Okay.

1034
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,510
Okay.

1035
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:39,230
Please, I'm just a tiny man.

1036
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,590
No, you're not.

1037
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,830
That's your gentle?!

1038
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,890
That

1039
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:55,710
is gentle!

1040
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,150
Oh, no, I'm heading there.

1041
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:11,470
I'm getting my thing is lowering my thing is lowering let me play let me play demo let me play

1042
01:00:43,290 --> 01:01:18,950
Kaboom I get this part down so well!

1043
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,090
Like, my hands know this part!

1044
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,710
They know this part!

1045
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,390
They downloaded this part into the brain!

1046
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,370
Okay, except for that part.

1047
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:43,770
I repeat the rhythm.

1048
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,310
Maybe I start going outside.

1049
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:48,590
Things will get easier.

1050
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,010
Just like all the other rhythm gamers.

1051
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,650
No, that's too much.

1052
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:54,730
That's actually too much.

1053
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:55,610
Going outside?

1054
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,410
That's a little too far.

1055
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,010
Doki.

1056
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,390
Doki, no!

1057
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,970
Too far!

1058
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,820
I always lose so much in this area.

1059
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,160
Oh, I lose so much HP!

1060
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,330
I always lose so much HP!

1061
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:39,470
Doki!

1062
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:40,410
Doki!

1063
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,350
Oh my god!

1064
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,730
3, 2, 1, begin!

1065
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,150
It

1066
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,040
must be mesmerized if you're filming it!

1067
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,670
Doki, no!

1068
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,130
Doki, no!

1069
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:06,470
Doki, no!

1070
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,590
Doki, no!

1071
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,270
Doki!

1072
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,390
Doki,

1073
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:19,310
no!

1074
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:27,810
Doki, no!

1075
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,060
Okay.

1076
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:49,600
Okay.

1077
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,300
Oh, this is the most misses I got for this run.

1078
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:11,320
Ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum, ba-da-bum.

1079
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,800
Oh my god.

1080
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,820
Oh, there he is.

1081
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,500
Hello, I'm Tiny Man.

1082
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,700
That's me.

1083
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,300
Tiny Man.

1084
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,300
Get ready for a 54 second mic.

1085
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,180
Look at the options real quick.

1086
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,120
It's always there.

1087
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,100
It's always there.

1088
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,350
It's always...

1089
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,640
It's always the 54 seconds.

1090
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,300
Oh my god.

1091
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,340
Can I get...

1092
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:22,940
Oh my god.

1093
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,860
If I have more friends.

1094
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:27,920
Okay.

1095
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,660
What if I have more friends?

1096
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,140
Okay.

1097
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,480
Alright.

1098
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,960
Maybe...

1099
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,520
Maybe it'll be easier.

1100
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,920
Maybe more frames equals more gaming.

1101
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,250
Maybe...

1102
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:48,920
Maybe my framework will save me.

1103
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,160
I mean...

1104
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,160
I mean...

1105
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:55,920
Surely...

1106
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,080
More frames equals more gaming.

1107
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,280
Surely...

1108
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,480
Okay.

1109
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,540
Okay.

1110
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:02,560
Okay.

1111
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,480
If I increased the FOV, it'd get easier, right?

1112
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,540
You needed this...

1113
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,220
Zero, you needed this...

1114
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,240
Thank you for the super chat.

1115
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:16,720
Thank you.

1116
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:17,220
Thank you.

1117
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,540
You needed disassociate.

1118
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:19,780
Alright.

1119
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,540
Let me...

1120
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:26,760
Okay.

1121
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,220
Is it faster?

1122
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,960
Guys, maybe more frames was not it.

1123
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,340
Guys, I don't think I like the more frames.

1124
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,170
Who would have guessed?

1125
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,070
Guys, I don't like this.

1126
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,010
I don't like the more frames.

1127
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:05,370
Frames.

1128
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,210
Oh, wait.

1129
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:16,170
Some more frames.

1130
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,650
My eyes can't follow anymore.

1131
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,070
Okay.

1132
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,890
What if I do less frames?

1133
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:28,690
We made my cap into third frames.

1134
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,020
Wait!

1135
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:16,840
That's 54!

1136
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,520
Frames the key!

1137
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,110
Oh my god.

1138
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:04,630
Frames the key!

1139
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:05,450
Wait!

1140
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,090
More frames the key!

1141
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,570
More frames the key!

1142
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:10,450
More frames the key!

1143
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,190
It's fine.

1144
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:14,170
It's a flip.

1145
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,330
It's a fucking flip.

1146
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:16,870
But more frames the key.

1147
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:17,830
Sorry.

1148
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,650
Thank you for the super chat.

1149
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:20,410
Thank you.

1150
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:21,230
Thank you.

1151
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,170
More frames!

1152
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,130
It is it!

1153
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,060
Okay.

1154
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,360
I'm locked in.

1155
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:13,270
Okay.

1156
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:14,830
More frames.

1157
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,410
It's Australia real.

1158
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,990
DUMBLE MAN!

1159
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:42,750
Oh!

1160
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:56,550
Oh my god.

1161
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:57,530
Oh my god.

1162
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:59,190
How am I breathing hard from this?

1163
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:00,550
How am I breathless?

1164
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:01,990
I'm not even outside!

1165
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,170
You guys!

1166
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,630
What!

1167
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,340
It's a friiise!!!

1168
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,380
It's over!

1169
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:21,980
Bye!!!
