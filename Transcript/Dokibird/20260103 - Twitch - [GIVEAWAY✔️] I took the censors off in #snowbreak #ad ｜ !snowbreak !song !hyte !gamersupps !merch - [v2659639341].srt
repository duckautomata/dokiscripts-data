Humans usually struggle to comprehend human magic.

144

145
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:26,370

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,530
Unrelated to the game.

That way...

177
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,030

178
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,470
What if she's Scandinavian?

179
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,130

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,120
Chat, what's the meta?

217
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,240
I- Whatever your heart's desire.

218
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,260
You just gotta find your waifu.

219
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,400
And that's the meta.

220
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,390
Frosty must die.

221
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,780

310
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,260
Oh, gosh.

311
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, gosh.

312
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,860
Anyway, there are some important things I do need to tell
you guys about Snowbreak.

313
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
I got a little distracted there.

314
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:48,100
But, Snowbreak has, for those who are veterans in Snowbreak,
here are some new important updates for you guys.

315
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,420
But Snowbreak has made dual character releases a standard.

316
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,000
So, every version, big or small, will feature two new
characters.

317
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:06,940
So basically, there's going to be a lot of good updates with
the two new characters, big or small.

318
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:16,100
Most importantly, the second every character, the second
character in every version, it will be completely free to

319
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,560
obtain.

320
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,020
So every update, there'll be two characters, and then the
second character will be free.

321
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,300
So including your exclusive weapons and manifestation,
making the game extremely free to play friendly.

322
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,320
So if you're new here, and it'll be zero cost for a
five-star character.

323
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,980
So if you're a new player, you can jump right in, grab a
free SSR character, and also 110 free pulls.

324
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,700
So it's very free-to-play friendly for those people.

325
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,900
Especially if every update they give you like a five-star

Wait, were you guys able to hear me?

438
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,740

attention to me right now.

439
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:54,080
But I just want to be sure that the BGM is not drowning me
out.

440
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,710
I honestly I have doubts if you guys are paying attention to
my voice right now

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,520
As me.

460
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,000
If you hadn't picked up, you would have missed today's

461
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,080
Fubu the Mage.

462

464
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,200
I think I know where this is heading.

465
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,760
I knew you didn't want to hang up.

466
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,040
Were you hoping I'd tell you something fun, agitant?

467
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:11,840
Yeah?

468
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,720
Let's see.

469
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,460
Hmm.

470
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,000
Oh, I've got it.

471
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,160
You know this, agitant.

472
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,300
I taught myself divination and talents in drawing books.

473
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,660
Oh, you're so smart, boo-boo.

474
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,240
I am looking at the beautiful.

475
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:46,120
roses surrounding her they're just as beautiful as here
she's so smart guys agitant if you could pick one which

476
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:56,180
class sounds more fun flying yeah I would say prophet I
should have said prophecy I could predict the future

477
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,000
So many kinds of magic, all totally different.

478
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,420
Maybe I should master just one first.

479
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
Dark, light, elemental.

480
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,280
Which one do you think suits me best, Adjutant?

481
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,160
Um.

482
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:40,690
Elemental, because then you can master all the elements.

483
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,250
Wait, you guys can see my cat.

484
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,440
But I'm head patting her, guys.

485
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,340
Look at that.

486
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,080
I'm patting her on the head.

487
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,280
potatoes, chestnuts, maybe even schwo to clap red.

488
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,540
Listen to me.

489
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,680
Do I sound way too obsessed with food?

490
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,100
I'm pet patting her.

491
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,060
Look, I'm rubbing her shoulders.

492
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,700
Good job for being so smart, boo-boo.

493
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,900
I'll be right here.

494
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:14,940
Oh?

495
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,020
Your personal companion is...

496
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,540
I'm sorry.

497
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,960
Reading is really hard right now.

498
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,860
I don't know why.

499
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,660
So, companion is here to spend some delightful idle time
with you.

500
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:36,460
Adjust the settings to customize the experience and make
even sweeter.

501
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,020
Oh, my God.

502
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:38,920
Okay.

503
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,180
Don't forget to move the camera to get closer to the girl.

504
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:47,020
So many girls really have to shout their lines when they
transform.

505
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,880
You can enable the timer and the camera.

506
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:02,080
You can enable a timer in settings and the game will exit
autumn.

507
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,640
Yo, you gotta time yourself, bro.

508
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,540
You might be trapped in here forever.

509
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,960
You might want to think twice before trying it.

510
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,820
You can change or stop the- Yeah, this is very- this is a
very dangerous game mode.

511
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,820
You gotta put the timer in there.

512
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,880
It's not every day.

513
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,600
I find a nice quiet spot.

514
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:30,180
Oh, there's- Oh my god, it's like- it's like those like um

new voicemails for even trigger special surprise special

518
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,980
events.

519
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,020
Alright, cool.

520
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,900
I understand now.

521
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,060
So...

522
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,360
Oh.

523
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,360
Wait, how do I...

524
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:09,970
I can't do anything.

525
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,290
Oh, I can take a picture of her.

526
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:14,210
Yay!

527
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:15,910
I can share her on Twitter.

528
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,090
Wait, I want to...

529
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,270
Give me that.

530
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,470
It's not every day.

531
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,770
I find a nice, quiet spot like that.

532
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,230
Give me a second.

533
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,670
Do it.

534
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:31,670
All right.

535
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:32,090
Give me a second.

536
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,810
I gotta do something real quick, guys.

537
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,790
All right.

538
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:38,830
How do I...

539
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:39,410
Okay, there you go.

540
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:40,830
Give me a second.

541
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,750
I gotta tweet something real quick, guys.

542
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,750
It'll be really fast.

543
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,230
Wait, where did I save it?

544
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,090
What did I do?

545
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,770
Oh my god, where's the photo?

546
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,450
Wait, where did I save the photo of my new waifu?

547
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,850
Wait, I got it.

548
00:45:58,850 --> 00:45:59,930
Sorry, I can't take another picture.

549
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:03,730
Oh my god, I can't.

550
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,890
I'm only given one photo.

551
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,030
Oh wait, I can't.

552
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,390
All right.

553
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,510
Where is it?

554
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,650
Okay, I found it.

555
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,270
All right.

556
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:15,730
It's okay, guys.

557
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,130
Give me a sec, guys.

558
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,090
This is very important.

time you know i need to start a timer when you guys are

564

565
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,640
All right, can you...

566
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,360
Wait, oh, I can't set a time.

567
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,060
Yeah, and then you want to like, you know, put your bragging

568
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,340
Do you understand, guys?

569
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,760
You're like, guys!

570
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,260
Look how beautiful she is.

571
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,800
All right.

572
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,400
Elemental magic is the umbrella term for four basic types.

573
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,580
Water, fire, fire...

574
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,720
I can't believe she's with me, guys.

575
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,620
Usually, if you can master even two...

576
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:06,260
You're already considered a pretty great mage so agitant if
it were you, which element would you start with?

577
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:22,460
Water if you learn water magic you could use it to water
flowers or even do the laundry Because I'm very thirsty

578
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:34,400
right now I've got it if you practiced in something cooler
maybe what no shirt then you wouldn't have to worry about

579
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,120
soaking that is so true that is so smart but i think you
just wear like a swimsuit you know

580
00:48:52,490 --> 00:49:05,910
oh hello uh fortune telling so tarot cards aren't for
brimming they're actually for fortune telling i totally you

581
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:16,250
burn them like talismans after all these books I think I'm
getting the hang of it agitant let me do a quick reading for

582
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:31,130
you she's so smart oh she's gonna read for me how's she
gonna read oh I was supposed to click something else after

583
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,710
uh uh Moon God.

584
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,890
This one signals opportunity.

585
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:41,770
A really good one.

586
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:46,010
I don't know exactly what you're working on, but just grab
it.

587
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,770
And your odds of success should weigh out.

588
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,570
Oh my God, 2026 is my year.

589
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,150
She thinks it's my year.

590
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,630
Just the way you hope.

591
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:57,970
Yeah.

592
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:03,970
Wait, does that mean like, was there anything that missed
something when when I said the other, when I asked this?

593
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,130
If it were you, which element would you...

594
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,170
Oh my god, the voice is...

595
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:18,240
If you practiced in something cool, I really am a
natural-born genius at this.

596
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,480
Was there anything I missed when she was doing that?

597
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,660
Feels like the...

598
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,060
Whoa!

599
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,880
For two to just lie here together.

600
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,540
Oh, you want me to call someone over?

601
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,700
Is that what you mean?

602
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,280
The hang of elemental magic.

603
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,620
Maybe it can even shave a bit off the utility bill.

604
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,320
I've heard some people fly on magic carpets.

605
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,820
Maybe my bed sheet could work too.

606
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,740
You might want to think twice before trying any new quirky
type gizmos.

607
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,040
What?

608
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,500
Is there nothing bonus?

609
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,500
Oh, the chair?

610
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,080
Oh.

611
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,200
Rooms used to be the classic way to fly.

612
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:18,480
But they're not exactly safe, and honestly, they're pretty
rough on the buns, so people have moved on from them.

613
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,260
These days, flying tools fall into three schools of thought.

614
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,580
The everyday type, the tech type, and the quirky type.

615
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,420
Every day uses stuff from daily life.

616
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:35,720
Blankets, cloaks, ordinary things turned into flying gear.

617
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,620
Tech gives normal vehicles a magical upgrade.

618
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,080
Oh my god, I spilled water.

619
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,260
Oh.

620
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,100
Guys, I don't know why I'm fumbling so much right now.

621
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:54,300
Oh my god.

622
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,660
I'm just trying to listen to...

623
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,620
I'm just trying to listen to my waifu.

624
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,140
Because I should have learned water that she was so red.

625
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,760
I should have taken off my shirt.

626
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,300
You actually prefer the quirky type?

627
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:18,840
Then maybe I should try growing a tail too Hmm Which suits
me better A cute little cat tail Or a curly piggy one

628
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,560
Why I think cat tail Yeah cat tail for sure I agree

629
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:49,850
I know right If only we can find a second person to lie in
bed with her If only wait what's this agitant what are you

630
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:54,510

631
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,790

633
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:22,320

634
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,080
Oh my god!

635
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,210
She was very thirsty, guys.

636
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:35,090
I got her some water, guys.

637
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,550
She was very thirsty.

638
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,640
Let me drink in your magic.

639
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,000
As much as you'll allow.

640
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,500
Oh, you want my water, too?

641
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:51,960
Here.

642
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,860
Only then can I truly become a powerful magic girl.

643
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,560
Yeah, I got some here.

644
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,080
If you want some water.

645
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,220
Wait, what?

646
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,880
Oh, yeah, my water in my pocket, right?

647
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,380
Oh, you're right.

648
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,480
How did you know I have a juice box in my pocket?

649
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,660
But before that, we need a little bit of preparation.

650
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,260
Oh, you need a straw with my juice box?

651
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,580
Don't worry, I got you.

652
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,080
First, we'll brew a potion.

653
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,200
This is not how I remember.

654
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,840
Man, this is...

655
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,360
Man, this is Wendy's.

656
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,840
Let's see what the grimoire says.

657
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,240
This is me, like...

658
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,580
I'm trying so hard to focus right now.

659
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,100
What does the Grim War say?

660
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,280
Oh, Blavu.

661
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,640
Thank you for the raid.

662
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,000
Guys, do not judge Blavu.

663
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,700
Do not judge me, right?

664
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,620
Welcome, everyone.

How do I...

Please, I understand.

675
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,980
I don't know what to do.

676

Oh, my God.

677
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,500
Nothing boo-boo can't handle.

678
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:15,780
Okay.

679
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,020
Whoa!

680
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,100
She's making me water, guys.

681
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,540
See?

682
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,920
She's...

683
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,900
She's making me water.

684
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,880
Look at that.

685
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,100
Wow.

686
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,080
It's my water.

687
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,400
Agitant?

688
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,340
I'm not strong enough to channel it alone.

689
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,180
I'll need your help to absorb it.

690
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:38,980
Oh, yeah?

691
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,520
I have a towel.

692
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,240
Does that work?

693
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,420
Here's how it works.

694
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:55,760
You'll drink the potion and let the magic flow through you
until I can draw the resonance out and join it with mine.

695
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,300
Oh, that seems pretty easy.

696
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,280
So how are you gonna draw?

697
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,840
Am I, how am she gonna draw the resonance out?

698
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,960
Obviously, I'm gonna, like, it's gonna come out in the upper
part of the body.

699
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,180
Yeah, with a straw, right?

700
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,080
With a straw.

701
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,920
That's what the straw is for, right?

702
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,400
Yeah, through a straw.

703
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,280
You're okay with that?

704
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,020
Then, may I feed you the potion?

705
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,300
Why does she need to feed me if it's through a straw?

706
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,660
It's bitter.

707
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,280
Let me taste.

708
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,520
Oh, here.

709
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,520
Yeah, yeah, here.

710
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,620
Here's the bottle.

711
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,620
Oh, man.

712
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,160
over to here.

713
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,600
We should add a little sweetness.

714
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,660
The camera shook because she shook the bottle really hard.

715
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,500
Honey, caramel, or maybe a little sweetness from me.

716
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,060
Which would you like?

717
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,800
I think Kira Nova would be pretty good.

718
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,060
You don't even have to say.

719
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,620
Oh, you got caramel syrup?

720
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,240
Wow, you think of everything.

721
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:30,660
Yeah, she brought me caramel syrup Guys, she...

722
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,460
A drop here, a little across my collarbone.

723
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,660
Oh, why did you spill it on your collarbone?

724
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:39,740
Here.

725
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:45,060
Oh man, now, oh bro, that's the hygienic booboo.

726
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,400
Done.

727
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,980
I had to tint all yours.

728
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,220
You ruined it.

729
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,980
It's gonna be so hard to clean up Caramel.

730
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,520
That is like this.

731
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,680
So warm.

732
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,780
You got me warm carabelle too?

733
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,740
It's coming.

734
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,100
Oh my god.

735
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,780
I can feel the magic building up inside me.

736
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,300
I'm so thirsty for it.

737
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,440
It's almost unbearable.

738
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,960
I should put a timer on.

739
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,140
What should I do?

740
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,600
Oh no!

741
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,680
We gotta call the ambulance!

742
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,440
What do we do?

743
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,200
Oh whoa!

744
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,640
Let me help you speedily.

745
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,300
along the channeling process.

746
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,500
Oh my God.

747
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:38,440
Sound guy, is the volume okay, Sam, do you want me to lower
it a little bit more, Sound guy, or is this like the perfect

748
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,720
volume right now?

749
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,440
Like maybe we should lower it a little bit more, don't you
think so, Sound guy?

750
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,080
Don't, don't break.

751
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,360
Oh, Sound guy, you want me to lower the volume a little bit?

752
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,020
Oh yeah, no, sorry guys.

753
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,640
I might have to, I might have to lower it

754
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,860
Don't put this on me.

755
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,560
Oh my god, look at what.

756
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,600
Look at what.

757
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:19,600
This spot right here.

758
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,440
Wait, wait.

759
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,560
Oh, don't we want to put the straw.

760
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:25,300
Guys, we're going to put the straw.

761
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,500
The straw on hand tongue.

762
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,460
Oh my god, you don't see me doing this, but I'm like
touching my forehead right now.

763
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,720
I'm fucking sweating right now

764
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:51,560
I don't know why it's so hot in my room I don't want any of
it to go to waste I need them

765
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,680
Oh my god

766
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,980
Man, you're so bad with the straw!

767
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,700
Your magic tastes incredible.

768
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,020
Oh my god.

769
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,100
Oh my

770
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,820
god.

771
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:29,790
They're so warm.

772
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,680
I'm glad I'm on Twitch right now.

773
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,960
I think something inside me is changing.

774
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,400
Oh my god.

775
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,720
Oh my god.

776
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,480
I'm on Twitch right now.

777
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,460
From now on, should I be calling you...

778
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:49,940
Master?

779
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,580
After all, our contract is finally complete.

780
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,560
So, Master, don't forget to keep sharing your magic with me,
okay?

781
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,500
This is... guys...

782
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,300
Yeah, it's not my fault.

783
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:32,090
I should have put a timer on.

784
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:36,530
Oh, what would you like to remind me of?

785
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:37,290
I should.

786
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:50,090
What does she say if I said that in four seconds?

787
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:53,370
All right.

788
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:57,150
You might want to think twice before trying any new quirky
type gizmos.

789
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:23,140
does every four seconds is she gonna remind me again what
exercise remind me to exercise does she do it oh oh as in

792
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,340
Okay, it's 18.

793
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,360
Um.

794
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,130
Oh.

795
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:45,970
Five.

796
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:47,530
All right.

797
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:48,930
Does she do it?

798
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:51,770
It's almost time.

799
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:57,870
You really have to shuffle the lines when they transform.

800
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,510
Kind of embarrassing.

801
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,590
Okay, it's almost happy new year.

802
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,810
It's like watching the ball drop.

803
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:09,350
Come on, we're almost there.

804
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:09,830
Hold?

805
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,190
She's gonna send us a little reminder.

806
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:15,570
Happy New Year.

807
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,510
Yeah.

808
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,670
Hold?

809
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,870
Come on.

810
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,430
Hold?

811
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,550
It's not 605 yet.

812
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,470
So many words in this book.

813
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,670
Oh, look at that.

814
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:34,830
Give me a little pet up.

815
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,270
She didn't remind me.

816
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,510
How did I mess it up?

817
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,030
What did I do wrong?

818
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,350
Why don't we get my little reminders?

819
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,190
Huh?

820
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:47,750
The

821
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,140
reminders?

822
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,880
No, that's not the time.

823
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,960
That's how long I've been here.

824
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,340
That's how long I've been here.

825
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,120
Oh my gosh.

826
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,020
Oh my gosh.

827
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:10,480
Okay.

828
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,780
Oh, apparently there's other interactions too?

829
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,260
Wait, what other interactions can we get?

830
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,580
How do we leave?

831
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,900
If you're this bad, so...

832
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,160
I don't really want to hang up yet.

833
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,880
When you're less busy, promise you'll call me again.

834
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,780
Yeah, yeah.

835
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,840
Don't worry.

836
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,480
Don't worry.

837
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,500
I'll call you again.

838
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,380
Yeah, time passes so fast when you're in a...

839
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,520
When you're in a Discord call with your girl.

840
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,220
Oh my gosh.

841
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,640
Alright, let's go.

842
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,880
Let's go check out our squad real quick.

843
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,180
Um, and I gotta find the cat.

844
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,320
That meow?

845
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,620
Oh, here you go.

846
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,660
Does she have an interaction?

847
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,360
Wait, no, that's not her.

848
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,080
You're not the right meow.

849
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,720
Oh, there you go.

850
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:18,640
That's my meow.

851
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,440
Okay.

852
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,120
So...

853
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,700
Oh, she doesn't have one yet.

854
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,740
Wait, who has one?

855
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,880
Oh, it's only her right now, right?

856
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:34,500
Because anyone...

857
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,720
Who else has...

858
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,320
Who else has interaction, or is it only Boo-boo right now,
chat?

859
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,800
Does anyone know?

860
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:57,880

1034
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:45,850
Alright.

1035
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:47,470
That's good, okay.

1036
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:49,530
Hi, Mia!

1037
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:52,310
I had your tent.

1038
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:53,950
Okay.

1039
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,130
Alright, at least we know.

1040
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:58,850
What's this?

1041
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:00,570
Switch actions.

1042
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:01,630
Oh, I can make her...

1043
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:02,830
I can do it.

1044
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:03,070
Oh!

1045
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:04,270
Oh!

1046
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,710
Oh!

1047
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:06,950
Oh!

1048
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,990
Oh!

1049
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,670
That's so stupid!

1050
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:17,010
Okay, say please, please leave the shower.

1051
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:25,530
We have complaints that you are, you are increasing the
water bill, so I need you to leave the shower.

1052
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:27,510
What's the story?

1053
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:34,330
Okay, no, I don't have, apparently, we don't have a lot of
affinity points.

1054
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,170
Apparently, I just sit down.

1055
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:43,310
That's me.

1056
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:46,450
That's me.

1057
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:49,110
Is there anything I could do in the room?

1058
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:55,930
I keep accidentally pressing E because E is like the
interaction button for me.

1059
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:58,110
That's it, right?

1060
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,460
Is there anything else we could do in her room?

1061
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:08,760
Any...

1062
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,360
Oh!

1063
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,780
Oh, the furniture?

1064
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:13,640
Well, she has no furniture.

1065
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:16,840
How do I give her furniture?

1066
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,020
Oh, I got a decorator room.

1067
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,900
How do I decorate a room?

1068
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:32,040
Oh, I have to buy her furniture.

1069
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:32,900
Oh, my God.

1070
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,400
All right.

1071
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,480
We're going to buy her furniture.

1072
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,000
I guess from this, right?

1073
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,040
GG selections.

1074
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:44,900
Where's Mia?

1075
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,100
This is Mia, right?

1076
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:50,720
Oh.

1077
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:54,840
I have enough.

1078
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,700
I'll grab her this.

1079
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,160
And this.

1080
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:01,140
And this.

1081
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,060
Don't worry.

1082
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,980
I'll make your own beautiful Mia.

1083
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,860
I'll make you love me.

1084
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,120
It's like you've never been a jerk.

1085
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,200
I'm just so really bad.

1086
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,380
I'm just very oblivious.

1087
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,980
I was like, what do you want?

1088
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,920
You want water, right?

1089
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:22,320
Yeah.

1090
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,650

01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,850
Oh, I thought I just bought...

1092
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,520
Sure.

1093
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,460
Please stop.

1094
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,360
Why do you always shower every time I come here?

1095
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:58,200
Please.

1096
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,020
Our water bill.

1097
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,780
Our water bill is too high.

1098
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,100

1099
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,120

1207
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,260
What's the letdown?

1208
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,170
Oh my god.

1209
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:23,490
How lucky is she?

1210
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,800
My turn now.

1211
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,440
Oh no.

1212
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:31,780

01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:47,680
Oh, this is...

1220
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,420
I'm a shooter.

1221
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:51,840
I'll risk it.

1222
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:52,740
Yes!

1223
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:54,380
I knew it!

1224
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,560
I took the gamba!

1225
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:57,100
I'm gaming!

1226
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,860
That should come in handy.

1227
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:01,680
There you go.

1228
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,320
She restored her health?

1229
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,200
That's cheating!

1230
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,600
Oh my god.

1231
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:08,960
She's actually cheating.

1232
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,860
How dare she use items?

1233
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:13,020
I am the agitant.

1234
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:19,800
Bullshit.

1235
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:24,080
You need any of this game?

1236
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:24,540
Don't worry.

1237
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,360
It's Snowbreak Containment Zone.

1238
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:32,460
I'm going to click on the link pinned in my chat or in the
panel or exclamation point snowbreak.

1239
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:35,640
We can still win.

1240
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,940
Don't give up.

1241
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,180
She has so many turns.

1242
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:44,740
Okay.

1243
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:46,120
Okay, we got more items.

1244
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,900
Let's give this a try.

1245
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:51,140
You.

1246
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,720
How dare you?

1247
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,360
Are you serious?

1248
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:57,420
Now, isn't it?

1249
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:59,000
She locked me up.

1250
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,480
Oh, nice.

1251
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,480
That's right.

1252
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,840
I'm a streamer.

1253
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,680
I always have.

1254
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,760
But she locked me up.

1255
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:07,620
Isn't it?

1256
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,720
No!

1257
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:15,170
I forgot she locked me up.

1258
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:16,570
Your face is rather flushed.

1259
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:17,370
Agitant.

1260
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:21,290
She got me.

1261
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:23,790
Okay.

1262
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,210
It's my turn.

1263
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:26,810
How many do I get?

1264
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:28,990
I got.

1265
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,530
That bullets the path for your next shot.

1266
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:32,570
Okay, I got a health gem.

1267
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:34,450
Oh, this is risky.

1268
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:36,170
Um.

1269
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:37,370
Okay.

1270
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,130
I'm gonna lock her up.

1271
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:41,170
And then shoot her twice.

1272
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:43,930
There's no way.

1273
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:46,490
And then...

1274
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:49,490
I could technically shoot her twice.

1275
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:50,150
Yes!

1276
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:53,430
No, I don't need a heal yet.

1277
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:55,270
She doesn't have anything.

1278
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:57,090
She can't do anything.

1279
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:57,950
Wait.

1280
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:00,270
We did set a safe word.

1281
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,090
Okay, and then I'll...

1282
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,100
I'll eat one.

1283
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:07,860
I'll eat one.

1284
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,020
And I'll shoot her again.

1285
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,360
Yes!

1286
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,480
Oh my god, I just always shoot.

1287
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,520
That's the key.

1288
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:17,940
Just always shoot.

1289
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,860
This should come in handy.

1290
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:24,340
Oh my gosh, she's just continuously eating the...

1291
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:25,920
Are you serious?

1292
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,040
There's no way.

1293
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:27,880
There's nothing in there.

1294
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,940
I took both shots.

1295
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:30,840
Stupid.

1296
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,080
Learn how to count.

1297
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,140
There's only two shots and I had both shots.

1298
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:37,400
That's right.

1299
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,280
I knew how to count.

1300
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:45,740
I shoot myself and get an extra turn.

1301
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:54,290
Alright.

1302
01:36:55,230 --> 01:37:08,150
Got an extra turn And I have extra items too Okay, it
doubles the power I got health Oh Well, I do have two double

1303
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:15,290
shots So I'm going to use one And then This is the risk I'm
willing to take Yes!

1304
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:17,590
Thrilling victory!

1305
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:18,710
I did it!

1306
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:26,110
We did it guys This isn't so bad.

1307
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:38,630
See or shoot you win Never back down Look at that What is
challenge mode?

1308
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,010
Like what do I get out of it?

1309
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:41,390
Oh wait.

1310
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:42,490
Oh wait.

1311
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:43,590
I can't challenge anyone.

1312
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:46,270
Oh Unlock after defeating at least two.

1313
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:46,650
Okay.

1314
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:47,750
We don't want to wait.

1315
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:48,790
I want to do one more shot.

1316
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:51,830
I'll do her All

1317
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:58,170
right Oh, shoot.

1318
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:07,160
Can't you go a little easy on...

1319
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,400
No dodging.

1320
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,520
Never punished.

1321
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,520
That's right.

1322
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:20,080
How...

1323
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,380
How does she do it?

1324
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,180
I don't like it.

1325
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,040
Can't you go a little easy on me?

1326
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:29,120
Bam!

1327
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,700
Got him.

1328
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,300
All right, I have x-ray, too.

1329
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,180
Oh, and I have handguns.

1330
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:34,820
cuffs.

1331
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:38,940
How many shots?

1332
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,040
Okay, I have three.

1333
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:49,140
I'm just gonna...

1334
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,240
I'm gonna risk it.

1335
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:51,980
It's three.

1336
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:52,680
It's three.

1337
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,360
There's no way.

1338
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,700
There's no way the first shot.

1339
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:55,540
There's no way.

1340
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:55,800
Nice!

1341
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:56,080
Okay.

1342
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:57,060
Oh my god.

1343
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,300
I was like, there's no way the first shot is the fireworks.

1344
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:01,840
Okay.

1345
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,680
Alright, and then we use glasses.

1346
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,400
Okay, it's fireworks.

1347
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:27,160
So I Alright, and then I shoot myself here Oh my god I'm
strategizing, I'm strategizing right now And then And then

1348
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:47,200
Watch this I lock her up That's right And then bam There we
go There we go I'm min-maxing right now.

1349
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:49,860
And then there's one more.

1350
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:50,670
And then.

1351
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:53,180
Bam!

1352
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,260
Another turn.

1353
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,760
My turn never ends.

1354
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,900
My turn.

1355
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,260
My turn never ends.

1356
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,160
That's right.

1357
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:04,500
Is this the whole game?

1358
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,360
We're still on the side game content.

1359
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,280
Okay, one out of one.

1360
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,200
Oh, that's easy.

1361
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,400
All right, we look.

1362
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,380
That works.

1363
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,080
That's right.

1364
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,600
You're never gonna shoot.

1365
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,160
I have a hundred percent accurate.

1366
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,160
Still my turn.

1367
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:24,160
All right.

1368
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:25,640
And then.

1369
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:27,760
And then.

1370
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:28,620
Bam.

1371
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:30,600
Aren't you getting hit shot.

1372
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:32,440
It's never.

1373
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,600
It's not gonna be her turn ever.

1374
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:35,880
Easy on me.

1375
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:37,320
Okay.

1376
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:37,560
Okay.

1377
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,420
Now it's her turn.

1378
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,520
play like for 20 years.

1379
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,360
Ooh, sweet luck.

1380
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:46,320
Oh, no.

1381
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,780
Wait, that's not fair.

1382
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,180
Ooh, sweet luck.

1383
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,660
Okay, wait, that's not fair.

1384
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,280
Okay, wait.

1385
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,260
Oh, no.

1386
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,220
Okay, please, please don't get the gamma.

1387
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,740
Please don't get the gamma.

1388
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,520

Already feeling the move.

1547
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:06,780

Can I just make all the cards vanish?

1559
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,120
That's right.

1560
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:38,700
Am I telling the truth?

1561
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,320

1564
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:50,080
There's no way there's that many snow cards.

1565
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,920
You can't be too careful, right?

1566
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:55,140
There's no way.

1567
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:01,180
Okay.

1568
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:03,880
Oh, it's here.

1569
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:06,780
Liar.

1570
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:09,880
I like how you're trying to...

1571
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,600
That's right.

1572
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:11,480
I knew it.

1573
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,600
I knew it.

1574
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:15,500
I was like, oh my gosh, you gotta take a shot.

1575
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,820
Yeah, I was like, are all of them snow cards?

1576
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,120
Not bad.

1577
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,220
Oh, every time, every time she's lying, she's got to take a
shot.

1578
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:25,900
Another snow card.

1579
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:26,460
I don't care.

1580
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,300
All right.

1581
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:29,520
All right.

1582
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:31,640
Oh, it's her new.

1583
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:32,000
Okay.

1584
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:39,580
All right, here we go.

1585
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,260
Looks like I need to adjust my strategy.

1586
01:52:45,700 --> 01:52:47,020
Three snow cards?

1587
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:48,820
There's no way.

1588
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:55,300
Liar.

1589
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,440
There's no way.

1590
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,380
Oh, my gosh.

1591
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:58,720
yet.

1592
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,260
Oh, wait, yes, I knew it!

1593
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:00,940
I knew it!

1594
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,540
Wait, what?

1595
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:04,340
Is that a snow?

1596
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,180
Oh, my God.

1597
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:09,300
Is that Joker card?

1598
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:10,280
Oh, my God.

1599
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,420
That's a Joker card.

1600
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:16,880
Oh, my God.

1601
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:20,540
Want to drink this yourself, or should I help you?

1602
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:28,300
Guys, I purposely, I knew I knew she was telling the truth,
and I wanted to take the shot, guys.

1603
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:41,140
I wanted to showcase you guys like what happens when you
mess up so it was calculated you should I did that on

1604
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:45,220
purpose guys the house always wins

1605
01:53:53,040 --> 01:54:01,100
who thunders okay okay what

1606
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,460
That's messed up.

1607
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,260
Guys, it's all calculated.

1608
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:14,440
Look what I conjured up.

1609
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:15,500
I didn't think.

1610
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,340
She didn't look like someone that would call me out.

1611
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:20,340
That's why I put her on the other table.

1612
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,140
You must have gone easy on me, honey.

1613
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,080
I lost!

1614
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,700
Okay, no, no, no.

1615
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,320
This can't be.

1616
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:29,560
We always win here.

1617
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,260
Wait, I got an idea.

1618
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:33,240
I got an idea.

1619
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,600
We gotta swap the girls.

1620
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,120
We gotta swap the girls.

1621
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,660
It's because those girls tried too hard.

1622
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:46,120
Those girls tried way too hard.

1623
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:51,320
Okay, same card.

1624
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:57,160
Looks like it's time to get serious.

1625
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:06,140
What should I do next?

1626
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:06,600
All right.

1627
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:08,700
Oh, right.

1628
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:12,540
Okay, what?

1629
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,640
I mean, that makes sense.

1630
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:14,220
One card.

1631
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:14,940
One flame.

1632
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,320
Oh my god.

1633
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:18,600
Oh, it's boo-boo.

1634
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:22,760
Oh, you instantly do it up.

Oh, man.

1637
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,500
Oh, she is a lightweight.

01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:33,440
One shot?

1639
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:39,800
Well, the shot has not been fully digested in your kidneys
yet, bro.

1640
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:45,950
Oh, yeah, she's already out.

This is the new event based off of the new update blast.

1760
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:10,620

1800
02:09:43,070 --> 02:09:44,990
I don't know if I'm autoing or not.

1801
02:09:45,250 --> 02:09:45,630
Oh, there you go.

1802
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:50,010

Star Wish.

1804
02:09:53,610 --> 02:09:55,950
Oh, we're going to decorate the trees.

1805
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:58,050
Oh my god.

1806
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:58,910
She's moving.

1807
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:12,930
I'm speed reading.

1808
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:14,570
I'm definitely speed reading right now.

1809
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,790
So what they're saying is that they're going to decorate a
tree right now.

1810
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:21,410
And she's talking about Star Wish, which is like Christmas.

1811
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:24,950
But for this world.

1812
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:25,890
For like Snowbray.

1813
02:10:26,370 --> 02:10:27,850
And then they're like.

1814
02:10:27,970 --> 02:10:30,250
Oh, yeah, Star Wish is coming up right now.

1815
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:32,490
And they're like, don't worry, I got a plan coming in.

1816
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:34,390
So then they're like, here's the plan.

1817
02:10:34,750 --> 02:10:38,810
And then they're like, okay, so what we're going to do is
we're going to do all of this for Star Wish.

1818
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:41,550
And then I'm like, that's a great idea.

1819
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:42,710
Let's have a Star Wish.

1820
02:10:43,030 --> 02:10:44,950
And I'm like, I'm totally down for this.

1821
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:49,470
And then they're like checking the plan and be like, okay,
we should do this for it.

1822
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:53,690
And then they're like, all right, so we're going to do that.

1823
02:10:53,790 --> 02:10:56,410
And then we should tell these people to do this.

1824
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:57,950
And then they're like, yeah, that's cool.

1825
02:10:57,970 --> 02:11:06,570
And then now, they're all writing a document because, you
know, you know, government workers, you know, it's like all

1826
02:11:06,570 --> 02:11:07,210
bureaucracy.

1827
02:11:07,710 --> 02:11:14,150
So they're all inviting the people being like, let's all go
do Starwish stuff, like decorate the Starwish tree and

1828
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:15,410
because it's the holidays.

1829
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:18,770
And then they're like, there.

1830
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:19,950
And then we're decorating the Starwish.

1831
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:22,230
See, I told you that was basically the story.

1832
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:26,850

1833
02:11:27,970 --> 02:11:29,370

I wasn't lying about the plot.

1839
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:43,490
Okay, so what could we do?

1840
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:49,970
Other than challenge, because I do want to try out a moxer.

1841
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:52,250
Can we do it in the main story?

1842

Can we play it?

1843
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:53,710
Let's try it.

1844
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:57,730
Or is there like anything we could do to try out like a
challenge thing?

Look at that.

2041
02:24:55,440 --> 02:25:01,780
I don't know what these numbers mean, but I think the lower
the number, the better.

2042
02:25:08,230 --> 02:25:11,730
I assume that's what it means.

2043
02:25:12,310 --> 02:25:12,950
Yeah.

2044
02:25:16,690 --> 02:25:20,090

Can I decorate my wish tree now?

2052
02:25:51,570 --> 02:25:52,650
Oh, we have to complete quest.

2053
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:54,730
I don't think we did a single quest, guys.

2054
02:25:56,550 --> 02:25:58,050
Wait, there's a...

2055
02:25:58,050 --> 02:25:59,230
What mini-game is that?

2056
02:25:59,410 --> 02:26:00,690

2058
02:26:02,730 --> 02:26:03,550

2059
02:26:04,510 --> 02:26:05,750
Or what mini-game is that?

2060
02:26:06,890 --> 02:26:08,070
Where do we go for that?

2061
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:09,090
Is it in the base?

2062
02:26:10,770 --> 02:26:12,990
Not a single quest.

2063
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:20,270
It's back in reflection.

2064
02:26:20,390 --> 02:26:21,090

character, which was Moxer.

2084
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:16,860
He used to get a zombie player earlier.

2085
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:21,280
All right, let's go.

2086
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:22,620
I don't have to play this.

2087
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:27,600
Hello, everyone.

2088
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:30,360
Be careful not to fall.

2089
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:32,980
Use bombs not auto-ers off, but be safe to yourself.

2090
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:34,080
Let the chaos begin.

2091
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:35,320
Okay, bomber fall.

2092
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:36,940
Just don't fall.

2093
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:38,640
Okay.

2094
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:41,240
That should be easy enough.

2095
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:41,960
Oh my god.

2096
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:42,820
They already got the shield.

2097
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,180
Oh my god.

2098
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:47,200
Coming for you.

2099
02:28:48,440 --> 02:28:48,440
Boom.

2100
02:28:50,040 --> 02:28:50,540
Oh my god.

2101
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:51,440
Oh my god.

2102
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:53,000
I gotta grab the shield.

2103
02:28:53,620 --> 02:28:55,040
I don't trust none of you.

2104
02:28:57,140 --> 02:28:57,580
Boom.

2105
02:28:58,660 --> 02:28:59,140
Oh my god.

2106
02:28:59,140 --> 02:28:59,140
Oh my god.

2107
02:28:59,140 --> 02:28:59,140
Oh.

2108
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:00,440
my god, my shield is already got.

2109
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:01,380
Oh, wait.

2110
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:01,700
Someone.

2111
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:02,080
Okay.

2112
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:03,100
Oh, I see.

2113
02:29:03,220 --> 02:29:03,340
Okay.

2114
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:06,820
So like, if it hits you, you like, okay, I got the shield.

2115
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:11,000
I think the key right now is that.

2116
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:14,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that was so scary.

2117
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:17,120
Oh, there's so, oh, my gosh.

2118
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:19,600
Oh, the walls are coming.

2119
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:21,140
Okay, I got the shield though.

2120
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:24,400
I'm gonna hold it.

2121
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:25,620
I think that's the key.

2122
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:36,560
I'm okay.

2123
02:29:36,900 --> 02:29:38,100
Wait, wait, how am I okay?

2124
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:39,060
Wait, how am I?

2125
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:39,900
Okay, I'm okay.

2126
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:41,640
I'm okay.

2127
02:29:41,640 --> 02:29:42,280
I don't know how.

2128
02:29:42,540 --> 02:29:42,820
No!

2129
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:43,240
No!

2130
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:43,600
No!

2131
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:45,000
I'm okay.

2132
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:47,620
I'm okay.

2133
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:48,860
I'm okay.

2134
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:52,700
I'm...

2135
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:01,180
I'm...

2136
02:30:01,180 --> 02:30:06,080

It spun, and I was like, I want to touch it.

2142
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:55,460
But it was not a safe wheel.

2143
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:56,900
It was not a safe stick.

2144
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:58,580

2145
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:03,860

I guess I was really thirsty.

2214
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,180
Basically, some people spawn as bad guys and they kill the
good guys and they kill the good guys.

2215
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:57,260
They become a bad guy.

2216
02:36:57,940 --> 02:36:58,820
Oh, okay.

02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:33,760

02:37:59,660 --> 02:38:00,140
That's right.

2235
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:02,280
Oh, oh, wait.

2236
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:03,020
Oh, my God.

2237
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,560
Sorry, I didn't know.

2238
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,600
Guys, when did I hide it accidentally?

2239
02:38:15,740 --> 02:38:16,680
When did it happen?

2240
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:18,540
All heroes have been enhanced.

2241
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:19,180
Move.

02:38:19,460 --> 02:38:20,800
Grab it fast.

2243
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:23,660
Oh, just when the game started, I got too excited.

2244
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:25,800
Bam!

2245
02:38:26,340 --> 02:38:28,320
Oh my god, why are you so tanky?

2246
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:29,140
What?

2247
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:32,560
He is so tanky!

2248
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,360
We gotta get him.

2249
02:38:39,610 --> 02:38:40,530
I can't believe it.

2250
02:38:40,570 --> 02:38:41,570
I started up.

2251
02:38:41,850 --> 02:38:43,590
I started off as a...

2252
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:45,770
as a robot.

2253
02:38:48,610 --> 02:38:49,750
Where's the last guy?

2254

thank you all for checking out snowbreak with me today that

2273
02:40:09,460 --> 02:40:16,700
was a wild ride like i said it's been a very long time i
think when the game first launched i'm pretty sure uh when

2274
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:24,660
the game first launched um was the last time i played
snowbreak so a lot has changed a lot has changed but there's

2275
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:34,340
like it feels like there's a lot more content there's Um, I
feel like the character animations and the character 3D

2276
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:49,200
models are are insane There is 100% rate up for limited
characters too and um Um, there's high quality 3D outfits

2277
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:55,200
and character interactions with low cost there's so many
things you can do basically There's also for new players for

2278
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:55,780
new players.

2279
02:40:55,820 --> 02:40:57,100
They do have a prologue.

2280
02:40:57,160 --> 02:41:02,220
They have a new prologue that they put in there That helps
new players easily catch up.

2281
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:04,160
So, you know, you want to catch up with the story and stuff.

2282
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:06,760
They do have prologue for it, so there's no FOMO for anyone.

And it is the only 3D waifu shooter.

accessibility.
