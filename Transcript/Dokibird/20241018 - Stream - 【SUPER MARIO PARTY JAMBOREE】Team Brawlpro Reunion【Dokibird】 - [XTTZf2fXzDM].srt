1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,460
See, I can't find this room, actually.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,080
You didn't make it an 8-player room by accident or something?

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,080
My game fucking fell.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,200
I knocked my switch off.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,000
Nobody is playing, so I feel like...

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,660
Either I have a very courteous chat, or my lobby isn't working.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,080
Okay, let me try.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,840
I knocked my switch.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,780
So now I have to rewatch this cutscene.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,660
I knocked the switch off.

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:25,960
Wait, what?

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,480
I knocked it off.

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,800
I can't find any rooms.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Search my room ID.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,560
Where's my team?

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,800
I put the ID in the thing.

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,280
You gotta put in the ID and then the code.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,420
It's in my group chat, noob.

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,720
Yeah, noob.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,420
I was gonna ask how was TwitchCon, but then I realized only one of you guys went.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,260
No, I saw you.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,140
Matt went.

23
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,080
Oh, Matt, you did go?

24
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,700
Yeah, he...

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,080
Oh yeah, he didn't play in the slam.

26
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,960
I didn't play in the slam.

27
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,120
Brawl Pro played in the slam.

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,020
I took him to TwitchCon.

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,800
He stayed at my house.

30
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,960
We played Superstars.

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,700
Mario Party Superstars.

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,580
Wait, so you guys did play Mario Party.

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,860
Okay, but it was like on like no sleep, up for 21 hours, and then we played, so I don't even remember.

34
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,380
Okay, I called dibs on Waluigi.

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,280
What?

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,360
I am Waluigi.

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,660
No, I'm Waluigi.

38
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,000
I literally am.

39
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm literally him.

40
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,340
How do you change characters?

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,740
Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to join this room fast.

42
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,080
Bro left.

43
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,360
I have to switch characters now.

44
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,660
How did you guys do that?

45
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,760
Dude, Waluigi is awesome.

46
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,660
Yeah, he's literally the best character.

47
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,260
What are you, a fucking Mario stan?

48
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,340
Dude, I just like Waluigi.

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,800
No, I meant Tony.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Why are you judging the Waluigi pick?

51
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,740
No, I love Waluigi.

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,680
That's why we pick.

53
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm a Wario guy.

54
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh, shit.

55
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,380
Okay.

56
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,380
I'm still trying to figure out...

57
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,380
Hold on.

58
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,020
You know what?

59
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,100
I made a room and then I gave up on the room because I figured I had to not play Waluigi.

60
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,780
I'm on the hot air balloon.

61
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,460
I'm trying to figure out where the plaza is.

62
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,460
The room still works.

63
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,280
You should be able to try it.

64
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
I'm not even at that stage.

65
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,640
I had to watch a cutscene.

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,660
What do you mean?

67
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,780
I had to watch a fucking 10 minute cutscene.

68
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,420
You know, I could invite you if you accepted my friend request.

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
No, I'm not doing that.

70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,620
He has a reputation to uphold.

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,140
He can't just have random people in his lobby.

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
In Nintendo, I gotta solve a puzzle.

73
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,460
You gotta watch a movie and solve a puzzle.

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,340
I gotta do the Da Vinci Code, the House of Leaves bullshit.

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,420
What the fuck is this?

76
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,300
Mario Party, Rhythm Kitchen, Toad's Items.

77
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,180
Go to the plaza!

78
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,340
I'm not watching a cutscene!

79
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,800
I guess I clicked Mario Party.

80
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,340
It's explaining to me Mario Party right now.

81
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,080
How do we play Mario Party?

82
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,660
Where's the plaza?

83
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,520
Do I get off the hot air balloon?

84
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,340
Raw Pro and Lazy Mat Man, can you guys show me your room info?

85
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,200
It's in Discord.

86
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,080
Is it the one I did?

87
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,000
No, it's the one I did directly after.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,340
Wait, guys, do I click Mario Party?

89
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,860
Get off the hot air balloon!

90
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,440
I wanted to be the host.

91
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,940
Yeah, well, it wasn't working when you did it.

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,460
What did it?

93
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,900
I don't know.

94
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,940
You wanna try another one?

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,720
Here, make another one.

96
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,740
End session.

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,520
You don't even have a party room and you're complaining about me not being there?

98
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
There you go, make another one.

99
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,900
No, I was kidding.

100
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,020
You said you wanted a new player, what?

101
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm eating my fucking bread.

102
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,820
You guys just figure this out.

103
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,460
Go back to the other window.

104
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,440
Alright, I'm creating another room.

105
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,300
Here I go.

106
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
My bread here.

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,800
Come on, guys, what the hell is going on?

108
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,580
Look, the moment we figured this out, we're unstoppable.

109
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,600
I will be- oh, there you go, I got it.

110
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,780
Alright.

111
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,240
Check this- wait, hold on.

112
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,100
Let me know if it works, I'm just spreading cheese on my bread right now.

113
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,720
It's the same thing.

114
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,620
It's the same code.

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,620
I just copied yours.

116
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:10,820
Okay.

117
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm joining up.

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm watching another cutscene.

119
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,220
Okay.

120
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,320
They're explaining about the plaza to me.

121
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,560
They're telling me- That's the last one.

122
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,800
Is that the last one?

123
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,680
I'll never be able to rewatch these cutscenes ever again.

124
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,920
I hope they were not important.

125
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,980
They'll be on YouTube.

126
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,080
When you're done with that cutscene, you press Y, and then put in the information.

127
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,120
Connect to the internet and play with- oh, I should hide that.

128
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
I should even show that.

129
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,120
Dude, I can't join it.

130
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,140
I'm putting in the code.

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,720
Oh, no, it's not working for you?

132
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,480
That's what happened to me.

133
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
Wait, maybe you guys have to be friends.

134
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:52,940
Yeah.

135
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,600
Oh, yeah.

136
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,200
I see Matt's room, because we're friends.

137
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm gonna accept- I guess we'll be friends, Matt.

138
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
What do you mean?

139
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,740
Alright.

140
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,800
I guess I'll add you to my friends list.

141
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,520
It says could not join.

142
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,120
Wait, what?

143
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,300
Alright, becoming friends.

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh, I can see what Bravo has been playing.

145
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,180
He's been playing Luigi's Mansion.

146
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
That was like two years ago.

147
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,860
Luigi's Mansion for five hours.

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,740
Stardew Valley, whoa.

149
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,840
For three hours or more.

150
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,080
This guy played Minecraft for 45 hours on the Switch?

151
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,900
You played Minecraft on the Switch?

152
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,280
What the fuck?

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,860
This was half a decade ago.

154
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,140
This was so long ago.

155
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,800
45 hours on Minecraft on the Switch.

156
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,980
Bro, why do you have 45 hours on Minecraft?

157
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,380
And he's like old, old.

158
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,240
So he was like 28 playing that game.

159
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,900
Oh my god.

160
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,180
Don't even get me started on how the oldest person was training for all the Mario Party mini-games.

161
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,040
You're talking about that.

162
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,140
And he's out here playing fucking Minecraft.

163
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,720
You watched YouTube on the Switch?

164
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,720
You have a PC for that?

165
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,580
They don't have Netflix on there.

166
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,780
I was in bed, dude.

167
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,360
Why can't I watch YouTube?

168
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,500
Alright, bro, I sent you.

169
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,100
Wait, but don't you have a phone?

170
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,460
Don't you have a phone?

171
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,600
Okay.

172
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,360
Watch out for my icon.

173
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,140
Don't get scared.

174
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,060
Oh shit.

175
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,820
Oh my god.

176
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,900
If you close your eyes, it feels like you just got hit by Mario.

177
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,640
Right before the fist comes in.

178
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,720
Alright, let's see.

179
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,460
Alright, let's see.

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,960
Okay, Matt's...

181
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,200
Oh, he has...

182
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh, hey.

183
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,780
His is not as bad.

184
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,120
His actually has actual games on his recent blade.

185
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:49,640
No!

186
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,560
Okay, I'm in.

187
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,640
Yeah, that's right.

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,180
I'm a gamer.

189
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,240
Alright, Matt.

190
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,460
What's the 4-digit passcode?

191
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,740
It's the same thing.

192
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,680
Okay.

193
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,860
Who the fuck picked Waluigi?

194
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,140
I don't know how to switch.

195
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,240
I can't believe it.

196
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,680
My thumbnail has me as Waluigi.

197
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,760
You're trying to say...

198
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,400
I will switch.

199
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm literally lying to my viewers right now that I'm not playing Waluigi.

200
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,940
I don't know how to switch.

201
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,900
Wait, you talked to Toad.

202
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
Over here.

203
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,260
Talk to him.

205
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,820
Nevermind, it doesn't work.

206
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,900
Nevermind, nevermind.

207
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,780
Maybe it's not letting me join because someone already picked Wario.

208
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,800
Even though I was Wario.

209
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,900
Because Cody is Wario.

210
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,220
What the fuck do I play?

211
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,740
Collectively picked Waluigi.

212
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm going to be in.

213
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,420
I can't believe it.

214
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
Where do you switch characters?

215
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,700
I know where to switch characters.

216
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,400
It will be faster.

217
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,100
You join as Wario.

218
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
I will choose my main.

219
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm being a shy guy.

220
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,420
It's fine.

221
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,700
Really?

222
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,460
Oh my god, thank you.

223
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,620
I don't want to clickbait my viewers, guys.

224
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,220
That's the only reason.

225
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
I didn't want to do it, but you made me do it.

226
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,820
I had to pick my main character.

227
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,200
Wait, what's your main character?

228
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,820
It doesn't matter what character you play.

229
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,960
Oh, it does.

230
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,920
And that is the opinion of a Mario Party noob.

231
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,140
You know, it makes me less of a nerd when you say that.

232
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,580
I don't claim them.

233
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,640
I've seen their recent tweet.

234
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't claim them.

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,340
I have relinquished the Overwatch title.

236
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,680
Very wise.

237
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,720
Alright, make a room.

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,540
Where's the room at?

239
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,280
Oh, me?

240
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,140
I got you.

241
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:47,660
Boom.

242
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,080
Create a room.

243
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,160
Alright.

244
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,960
I feel like it's my fault.

245
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,660
I hope everybody can be...

246
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,060
You can hear everybody, guys, on my chat.

247
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,460
He's Boo now?

248
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,760
I am not Boo.

249
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,360
I am Boo.

250
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,920
It's the next quirky character I can think of.

251
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,500
Why are you judging his picks?

252
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
Yo, I have not gotten a single pick as an A-OK from Kony so far.

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,380
Wait, what's the password?

254
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,240
I never looked at it.

255
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,260
Oh, there it is.

256
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,700
It doesn't even matter.

257
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,020
They can see my password.

258
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
It doesn't matter.

259
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,680
They have to be friends with you anyway to join.

260
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Oh, true, true, true, true.

261
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,740
Okay, I'm in.

262
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,340
Let's go.

263
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,740
Is it really the Wario thing?

264
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,660
That's crazy.

265
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,020
I'm in too.

266
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,340
We're figuring it out, guys.

267
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,220
We're figuring it out.

268
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,380
Alright, preparing for the party.

269
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,660
It's party time.

270
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:45,860
Yay!

271
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,180
Are you guys ready?

272
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,780
Ready to destroy Kony.

273
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay, guys, alliance.

274
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,760
I like this run.

275
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,980
I won't be shy guy, actually.

276
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,540
Kony, I swear to God, dude.

277
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,620
Oh, it is cute.

278
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,460
I'm already shy guy, man.

279
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,920
Oh my God.

280
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,000
What do you mean?

281
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,040
I thought you were going to play your main.

282
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,460
I thought you were going to try, Kony.

283
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,740
Are you going to give up now?

284
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,680
Are you scared?

285
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,020
Are you fucking scared?

286
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,460
We need to play it.

287
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,380
First to five.

288
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,720
You guys are beefing.

289
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,720
You guys got to settle that.

290
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,280
Alright, I'm ready.

291
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,100
How do we start the room?

292
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,820
Over here, right?

293
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,460
Do we just go up the balloon?

294
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,080
Oh, we do.

295
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,940
We all ride the balloon.

296
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,900
Slime's not here because he was busy.

297
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,900
Yeah, he's busy watching the stream.

298
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,380
Wait, is he watching the stream right now?

299
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,880
Slime, why aren't you here?

300
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,900
Mario Party.

301
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,860
Friends.

302
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,940
Ah, there you go.

303
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,180
Hey, can we do the mall level or the race cars?

304
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,100
I was going to ask that.

305
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,500
Toki's actually reading this.

306
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,100
Guys, what did it say?

307
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,280
Look at you peasants reading.

308
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
A to jump.

309
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,720
A to jump.

310
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,400
I skipped 15 minutes of cutscenes.

311
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,920
I don't know what's going on.

312
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know.

313
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,440
90 minutes?

314
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,500
Isn't that like 2 hours?

315
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,820
It's not 2 hours.

316
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,780
That's not 2 hours.

317
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,880
It's like a low estimate.

318
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,640
The estimation they gave us is low.

319
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,440
It shouldn't be 90 minutes.

320
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,780
Oh, it's 10 turns?

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Oh, never mind.

322
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,900
Usually, we go 15.

323
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,620
Minimum.

324
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,720
Bonus stars to who gets robbed at the end.

325
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,620
Isn't that bonus stars?

326
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,280
Yeah, bonus stars on.

327
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,740
I mean, that's the essence of Mario Party.

328
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
We're gamers.

329
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,400
It doesn't matter.

330
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,180
That's how I win.

331
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,760
Okay, turn it off.

332
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,420
I played a match earlier.

333
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,220
It was fine.

334
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,680
Who's on Wi-Fi?

335
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,780
See, I didn't know it was going to be like this.

336
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,840
I can...

337
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,420
Wait, wait, wait.

338
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,020
Listen, guys.

339
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,440
I have a cord, but it will just take me 5 minutes to run that 100-foot cable upstairs.

340
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,100
We can see how it runs.

341
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,540
Do you have an adapter?

342
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,460
Yeah, I do.

343
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,500
My router is literally right next to me, so I'm okay with having Wi-Fi.

344
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,260
Did I pause the game for everyone?

345
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,380
Yeah, I did.

346
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,040
Oh, shit, my bad.

347
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,160
I was trying to skip it.

348
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,660
Alright, maybe it'll work.

349
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,780
If it doesn't, I can go set it up.

350
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,940
Yeah, he's like literally in the basement away from the Wi-Fi.

351
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,660
Nope, not anybody's first time.

352
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,040
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

353
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,100
Doki said yes.

354
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,140
Doki said yes.

355
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,220
Sorry.

356
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,260
It's my first time.

357
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,340
Sorry, Mr. Mario Party knows everything about everything.

358
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,780
He fucking played the game 2 hours before he could have.

359
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,060
Wait, you can't just have me explain this and then skip everything.

360
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,240
If you wanted to read, go ahead.

361
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Take your opportunity.

362
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,520
I can't read this.

363
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,860
I'm not a speed reader.

364
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,680
What are the pads for?

365
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,960
What are the pads for?

366
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,960
Doki hit A.

367
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,020
Doki hit A.

368
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,140
Yo, what is that?

369
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,000
This is Cody's fault.

370
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,540
This is Cody's fault.

371
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,040
I heard Doki hit A and then I hit it.

372
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,640
This is your fucking fault.

373
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,660
That's a 5.

374
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,460
You can't read.

375
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,420
Why is Waluigi punching his face?

376
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,280
Damn, those renders are HD.

377
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,160
Holy shit, man.

378
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,400
Just wait till it's switched to...

379
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,180
I can't wait.

380
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,220
Do you guys see the Pokemon leaks?

381
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,240
Yeah.

382
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,020
I mean, all of a sudden, it feels pretty clean.

383
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,480
I don't know.

384
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,540
Yeah, this feels okay.

385
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,800
Maybe it was just rendering.

386
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
Maybe it's just trying to figure out where you were.

387
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,280
It feels good now, right?

388
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
I mean, I'm hitting A.

389
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,440
It's working.

390
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,480
I mean, we'll see when the minigames happen, I guess.

391
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,640
I just feel like when I hit that dice block, it was fairly responsive.

392
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,120
Oh, I just...

393
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,040
Were you guys figuring out what to hit?

394
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,180
Vroom vroom.

395
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,660
Set, go!

396
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,340
Yay!

397
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,620
Sorry, I must take a look at the board.

398
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,080
Oh my god.

399
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,620
Oh my god.

400
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,000
It's the first turn.

401
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
Three times a game.

402
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,320
Good game.

403
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,120
Yo, what's happening?

404
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,340
I'm running a jump pad.

405
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,920
Wait, what's the jump pad?

406
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,340
Man, I wish I knew what the jump pad was.

407
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,420
Where are you going with this?

408
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,080
I don't know.

409
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,240
It said hold L or R.

410
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,880
I kind of did.

411
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,280
Oh, to fast forward.

412
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,180
Well, if you actually read the rules, you might know what the jump pad was.

413
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,100
Look around?

414
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,140
Okay, sorry.

415
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,780
I'm looking around.

416
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,800
Dude, look in while we see nothing.

417
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Alright.

418
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,180
We're good.

419
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,540
We're good.

420
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,960
We're ready.

421
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,080
Alright.

422
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,920
I'll take it.

423
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,660
Vroom.

424
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,500
I like that.

425
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,860
Nice red bean.

426
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,440
You lose coins.

427
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
Alright, Pony's turn.

428
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,660
I have nothing.

429
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,160
You had 10.

430
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,480
You start with 10.

431
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm giggachatting.

432
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,900
I'm not even looking at the board.

433
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,860
That's right.

434
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,440
You saved me.

435
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,200
He's already memorizing.

436
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,800
Yo, big, big, big.

437
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,080
Hey, you got lucky.

438
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,760
You got lucky.

439
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,080
Get two stars.

440
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,560
Wait, what's this?

441
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,180
I mean, that's whatever.

442
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,540
Wait, you get to steal the coins?

443
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,040
And I'm gonna get your coins.

444
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,420
Now that I'm ahead of you.

445
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,400
Alright.

446
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,140
See ya, loser.

447
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,920
Bye.

448
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,060
Oh, hey.

449
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,800
What do I have?

450
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,260
Oh, what's the mushroom ticket?

451
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,780
Use which adds plus 5 to 2 or 4 times.

452
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,460
That seems kind of broken.

453
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,940
Wait, what about that golden dice?

454
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,020
Wait, you can't afford that yet.

455
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,340
That's like a custom dice block.

456
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,020
I'm gonna get the mushroom ticket.

457
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,760
That seems more...

458
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,260
Uh...

459
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,020
Fuck, okay.

460
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,440
No, I'm gonna go triple dice.

461
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,180
That's where the money is at.

462
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,100
I didn't know this game had a quadra dice.

463
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,140
That's insane.

464
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,440
Yeah, that's for this course only.

465
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,860
I think they added it for this game, right?

466
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,940
It's for this map only.

467
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,220
Like, the whole idea is that you go really far really fast.

468
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,640
Alright, I'm ready.

469
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,280
Oh no, a creepy dice block!

470
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,340
Wait, what the fuck is a creepy dice block?

471
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,220
Oh!

472
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,260
So you get one to three.

473
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,360
I can make you guys... I know who to use it on.

474
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,720
Wait, I already have no money, so...

475
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,880
You have seven cents.

476
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,620
Oh, one to three?

477
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,160
Yeah, let's beat his ass.

478
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Alright, let's beat his ass.

479
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,120
Dude, what is this?

480
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,440
Let's beat his ass.

481
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,260
It is based on the space you land on.

482
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,620
It is based, I agree.

483
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,320
Beat his ass, bro.

484
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,220
Alright, what's this?

485
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,680
Oh no!

486
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,320
I hate this one!

487
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,460
Wait, we're friends now.

488
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,220
Don't get me!

489
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,240
Wait, how do we... Oh, so we have to run away from him.

490
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:21,540
Oh!

491
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,540
So he...

492
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,960
There's no way he's gonna get us.

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,100
I figured it out.

494
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,860
You ain't getting my ass.

495
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,960
This is fighting game mix-ups.

496
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,180
As long as one of us lives, we win, guys.

497
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,240
We just need... I have to get all three to win?

498
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,880
That's crazy.

499
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,400
That's one to three.

500
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm stalling, I'm stalling, I'm stalling.

501
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,740
Yeah, me too.

502
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,640
Wait, guys, guys.

503
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,180
Oh!

504
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,420
Wow!

505
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,520
Wow!

506
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,840
That's fine, that's fine.

507
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,080
Lag switch, lag switch.

508
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,060
He's getting frustrated, he's lag switching.

509
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,760
He's lag switching, he's lag switching.

510
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,200
No!

511
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,760
He's lag switching!

512
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,180
That's alright, that's alright.

513
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,100
How will I ever deal with this?

514
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,200
26 seconds.

515
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,020
No, no, we...

516
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,360
Yep, yep, yep, yep, I like that.

517
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,840
I like that.

518
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,220
That's the wrong person.

519
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,900
That's you!

520
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,580
You picked up yourself.

521
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,560
Okay, I see what you're doing.

522
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,460
It's up to you, it's up to you.

523
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Wait, this is kind of free.

524
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,780
Hold on, this is kind of free, actually.

525
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,320
Wait, wait a minute.

526
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,580
Oh, no!

527
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,580
Oh, God!

528
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,040
Wait, my game won't load.

529
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,320
I'm kicking the router.

530
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,560
Kick him out, kick him out!

531
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,920
He's playing on Wi-Fi.

532
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,880
Dang.

533
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,600
I just needed one rotation, I'm sorry.

534
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah, if you rotated one more time, we would have won, bro.

535
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,740
Guys, I saw...

536
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,960
I saw you were a gamer, what happened?

537
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,700
Okay, well, that's a 1v3 game and those are explicitly designed for the one person to win, so...

538
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,920
Yeah, but you should be good enough...

539
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,320
I thought you were good enough to win these types of games.

540
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,760
You've been practicing many games.

541
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,180
I am, but it's a little laggy and I haven't seen that game.

542
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh, true, true.

543
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,640
Actually, that's a legacy game.

544
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,200
That game is an older Mario Party.

545
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,680
Wait, how would you know?

546
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,060
I play a lot of Mario Party.

547
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,860
Oh, yeah, which Mario Party is it from?

548
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,940
I think it's from 5.

549
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,660
I hope somebody crashes into you and you die.

550
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,560
Oh my god!

551
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,580
Oh my god, it is happening!

552
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,380
He manifested that.

553
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,240
That's crazy.

554
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,240
That's fucking right.

555
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,240
You deserve that.

556
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,580
You didn't clutch it, so that's your kick.

557
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,920
Yay!

558
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,960
Oh, I'll take it.

559
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,120
Oh.

560
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,900
Oh, should I buy what Doki bought?

561
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,740
You don't need it.

562
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
Yeah, actually, no.

563
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,460
Buy what I bought.

564
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,660
Roll whatever number you want.

565
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,520
Wait, get the quadra.

566
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,400
Yeah, the quadra looks really good.

567
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,340
You should get it.

568
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,300
I think this would be useful.

569
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,280
You should get the quadra.

570
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,240
You guys didn't play the last Mario Party.

571
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,460
Maybe MatMay, maybe you did.

572
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,540
But the last Mario Party had one of these sticker things.

573
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:08,960
Yeah.

574
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,300
Except it would go...

575
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,460
What the fuck?

576
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,820
And you could spam it over and over.

577
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,700
That's amazing.

578
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,120
You seem to be the guy that spams.

579
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,980
Did you spam it?

580
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,340
Were you the spammer, Kony?

581
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,680
No, I didn't do that.

582
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,940
You were the spammer, weren't you?

583
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,080
I didn't spam it.

584
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,580
It's a...

585
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,520
seven.

586
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,480
You've got it again.

587
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,800
He has.

588
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,240
You're not even gonna move.

589
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,180
You're gonna be stuck here.

590
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
I'm gonna lap you.

591
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,940
Dude, what?

592
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,100
Yeah, he's gonna get lapped.

593
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,460
He's gonna get a three next.

594
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,400
He's gonna get a three.

595
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:47,940
My turn.

596
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,660
You know what?

597
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,760
You know what?

598
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,280
Okay, just to be sure.

599
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,980
It's like when you go to the go-karts and one of your friends has one of the shit with no gas in it.

600
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,140
Ain't no way.

601
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,280
You've got it again.

602
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,920
What are you doing?

603
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,620
Wow.

604
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,700
That's creepy, guys.

605
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,640
Just to be sure.

606
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,680
I just wanna make sure we actually lap you.

607
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
I just...

608
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,840
That is hilarious.

609
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,940
That is next level.

610
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,480
I hope they run you over too.

611
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:15,980
Go off.

612
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Go off.

613
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,420
Okay, actually, no.

614
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,720
I'm gonna go this way.

615
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,000
What is that exclamation?

616
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,000
That's when you get ran over?

617
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,760
That's the one where Matt gets ran over.

618
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
I was like, oh, what's this?

619
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,160
Funny color.

620
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,660
And it fucking destroyed me.

621
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,540
Alright, alright.

622
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,480
If this is very laggy, I'll go and plug that shit out.

623
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,900
I mean, the other one wasn't too bad.

624
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,460
This whole thing's fine so far, honestly.

625
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
Hot cross blocks?

626
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,940
What's that?

627
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
This is my main game.

628
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,060
Oh, this is your main game?

629
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,440
Now I must lock in.

630
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,700
What is this?

631
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,300
Choose the same as someone else.

632
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,040
No one gets it.

633
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh.

634
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,560
Oh.

635
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,260
Oh, so we all have to get different...

636
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,400
Oh, it's literally luck.

637
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:57,920
It's RNG.

638
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,580
So, it's like, okay.

639
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,200
Alright, I guess.

640
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,340
So you gotta pick one that the other people don't pick.

642
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,740
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,520
So you gotta make sure you don't pick the one...

644
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,240
Okay, I picked it.

645
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,700
Someone is not picking.

646
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,080
Someone is thinking.

647
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,200
Someone is thinking.

648
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,480
It's a cerebral game.

649
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,820
They want the two.

650
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,520
They're greedy.

651
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,480
I'm not even looking at what the blocks are.

652
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm literally just pressing buttons.

653
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,380
I'm letting RNG take me.

654
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,900
Come on, Connie.

655
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,680
Oh my god, Matt, stop!

656
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,440
Matt,

657
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,580
I swear to god, Matt.

658
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,960
I swear to fucking god, Matt.

659
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,640
Don't you fucking...

660
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,920
I swear to god.

661
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,340
I swear to god, Matt.

662
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,240
I'll let it go, I'll let it go.

663
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,900
I swear to god.

664
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,400
Go ahead, go ahead.

665
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:57,780
Yes.

666
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,880
Wait, you didn't pick?

667
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Why didn't you pick?

668
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,760
My shit was lagging, that's all.

669
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,420
You didn't even pick one.

670
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,860
We definitely know who's the problem here.

671
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,280
We definitely know.

672
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,460
All I'm saying is...

673
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,840
There'll be no fucking way.

674
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,880
Oh my god, no fucking way.

675
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,700
Okay, I'm pulling up Connie's stream.

676
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,140
I'm pulling up Connie's stream.

677
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,000
Don't go for the threes.

678
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,900
It's not gonna work.

679
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,720
Unless I do it.

680
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,840
If I do it, it's gonna work.

681
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,600
Why?

682
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,140
Stop it!

683
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,340
Stop!

684
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,000
You guys are way back there.

685
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,820
This is obvious.

686
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,220
I picked left.

687
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,140
I picked left.

688
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,840
I swear to god, Matt.

689
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,620
First you take my Waluigi, then you...

690
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,540
I swear to god.

691
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,040
I...

692
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,200
I want Matt.

693
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,320
I swear to god.

694
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,400
I went down.

695
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,640
I picked down.

696
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
No one picks it.

697
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,220
I went down.

698
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,620
I don't think.

699
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,040
I won't vocalize.

700
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,980
I went up.

701
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,560
I swear to god, if you pick it, you ain't getting shit.

702
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
I went up.

703
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,580
I can destroy Connie.

704
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,040
Whatever you go for, you're never gonna get it.

705
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,580
I picked right side.

706
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,560
I picked right side to win, guys.

707
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,700
You can't win.

708
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,620
What the fuck is that?

709
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,500
I can't win.

710
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,100
You can't win.

711
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,440
You don't get shit.

712
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,840
Someone get the three column.

713
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm not getting that.

714
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm fucking playing to win on my own.

715
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,100
Hold up, Connie.

716
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,820
Dude, I can't win.

717
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,820
I literally can't win.

718
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,720
Yes!

719
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:04,920
Let's go!

720
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
Let's go!

721
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,920
The comeback of the century!

722
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,560
I like that outcome a lot, actually.

723
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,800
I deserve it.

724
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,160
All I'm saying is that I deserve this more.

725
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,140
I definitely deserve this more.

726
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,100
I thought this was a kid's game!

727
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,880
You took too long to think.

728
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,620
I wasn't thinking.

729
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,000
That's why you're asking for it.

730
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,160
I'm coming for you now.

731
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm killing the boo, bro.

732
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,420
That was the craziest play.

733
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,820
The comeback.

734
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,720
I can't believe that I didn't do the same one you're on.

735
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,680
Wait, what's this?

736
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,660
I know, right?

737
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,980
Like, just maliciously.

738
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,980
Wait, where did you go?

739
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,840
What the hell?

740
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,080
That's very dangerous.

741
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,340
Let's see.

742
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,240
Let's see here.

743
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,360
How much are stars?

744
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,720
Oh, I see.

745
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,120
20?

746
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,020
Okay, I'm almost there.

747
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,700
The good thing about going 2 is I have lots of time to get coins.

748
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,680
Can't wait.

749
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,860
Okay, we can just lap you.

750
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,220
7.

751
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,500
Oh!

752
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,660
You need...

753
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,920
That's good, because then you have enough time to get stars.

754
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,260
Yes.

755
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,320
Pro said yes.

756
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,480
Yeah!

757
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,780
That's how math works.

758
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,920
Oh, and he gets a triple dice, too?

759
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,600
Yo, I'm getting Mario Party'd right now.

760
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:42,880
Alright.

761
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,500
I wonder what you're gonna get.

762
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,600
1, 2, or 3.

763
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,960
I cast Mushroom Spell.

764
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,260
Does it kill the other one?

765
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,780
Cancel.

766
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,340
Okay, okay, some kind of play happening.

767
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,720
Creepy dice.

768
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,160
But you wasted...

769
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,700
Dude, if he got 3 that time, I would've cried.

770
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,100
What are we doing with the 13?

771
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,320
Nah, I'm keeping me money.

772
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,200
Ow, I can't believe you wasted that mushroom for this.

773
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,280
Oh, what is this?

774
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,420
Go up!

775
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,120
Go up, Cody!

776
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,200
Go left, Cody.

777
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,180
Don't you wanna know what happens?

778
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,340
I wonder what will happen.

779
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,560
Actually, that is a good question.

780
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,380
What will happen?

781
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,200
Wait, wait, what do you mean?

782
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,920
I like that you can see the skin marks.

783
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,180
You get the star, and I get a happening point.

784
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,540
Wait, why did you pick that route?

785
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,760
Because you also have to run.

786
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,080
Oh, you guys both at the left!

787
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,560
Well, well, well.

788
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,440
Well, well, well.

789
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,960
Ain't no one getting the star today.

790
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,840
Nobody's getting that star.

791
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,520
This is gonna be the first 0 star game.

792
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,380
Hey, guys.

793
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,980
Oh, I'm lucky too!

794
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,520
I always feel like I'm lucky.

795
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,280
Oh, and I got a 7!

796
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,200
Let's go.

797
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,020
Pam first.

798
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,380
Ding, ding.

799
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,300
I hope we get my favorite game.

800
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,600
What's your favorite game?

801
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,580
Uh, it's...

802
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,320
Snag the Flags.

803
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,420
Oh my god, it is!

804
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,420
Oh my gosh, you got your favorite game.

805
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,360
Snag the Flags.

806
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,200
I love this game.

807
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,260
Snag the Flags.

808
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,120
Okay, run around the sphere and capture the flags.

809
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,060
It's grab blue things.

810
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,920
Does that make it snag it from you guys?

811
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,680
Oh, you just grab the flag?

812
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,960
It's literally just grab blue things.

813
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,460
Oh, wow.

814
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
I missed it.

815
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,660
Cool, I guess.

816
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,100
Epic game.

817
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,260
Hit start.

818
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,580
He's warming up, guys.

819
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
He's warming up.

820
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,680
I'm going up.

821
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,560
Oh my god, fuck you.

822
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,700
Sorry, big dog.

823
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,220
That's mine.

824
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:47,840
Oh!

825
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,940
Why are they giving Coney all of them?

826
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,620
Those are mine.

827
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,860
Get out, get out, get out!

828
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,880
This is mine, too.

829
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,760
Get out.

830
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,880
Oh my god.

831
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,140
This is literally the Donkey Kong cluster.

832
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,880
Oh, my god.

833
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,360
Oh my god.

834
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,900
Where are they?

835
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,960
Where are the flags?

836
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,160
Where did they go?

837
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:13,660
I see nothing.

838
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,960
No, who let Kong out?

839
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,320
Who are you guys on the map?

840
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,380
I've been waiting for years.

841
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,800
Excuse me.

842
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,760
Oh my god.

843
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,600
You know what?

844
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm going to take a break.

845
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,580
You guys find that last one.

846
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,480
Oh my god.

847
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,960
He has 25!

848
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,760
He has 25 flags!

849
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,020
Because in the beginning he got the perfect freaking RNG.

850
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,620
Some might call it RNG.

851
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,820
Oh, I retracted my teeth.

852
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,660
He has no teeth now.

853
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,980
Oh my god, he's like a baby.

854
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,280
He doesn't feel threatened.

855
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,060
So you guys got so fucked up that he's not scared anymore.

856
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:49,440
Right.

857
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,780
That's alright.

858
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,340
At least he has no stars.

859
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
As long as I'm not fourth place, I'm chilling.

860
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,820
Look, he might have won the minigame, but he has no stars.

861
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,520
With all that money.

862
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Oh, hey Mario.

863
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,480
What is he doing?

864
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,080
As an ally?

865
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,320
Can we read what they're saying?

866
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,580
Oh, okay.

867
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,380
Why is he skipping that shit?

868
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,300
Basically, he lets you buy two stars at once if you want.

869
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,900
Wait, how do we get to him?

870
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,740
Can I get Mario?

871
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,860
Can I have him?

872
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,300
No.

873
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,980
I want Mario.

874
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,840
Oh, I'm getting Mario.

875
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,880
Guess he's getting a traveling star.

876
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,440
Yeah, Mario's in the middle of the road.

877
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,960
Wait, run him over.

878
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,900
It'll be so funny.

879
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,900
Run him over.

880
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,400
Then you can be the new star of Mario Party.

881
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,180
Boo Party.

882
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,220
Yeah, Boo Party.

883
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,000
Oh, the pit stop.

884
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,720
What does that do?

885
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,000
Oh, it's a dice.

886
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,400
Sure.

887
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,840
Does he give you three?

888
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,440
I don't know what this is.

889
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,720
Oh, you got double dice.

890
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,260
He's just cleaning your car.

891
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:02,660
Oh, cool.

892
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,720
They like do the thing.

893
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,860
Oh, what?

894
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,500
Okay, alright.

895
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,480
Give me a third one.

896
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,540
I don't like that.

897
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,260
Holy shit, man.

898
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,080
From the pit stop?

899
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,060
You're not getting any stars.

900
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,960
You got no money.

901
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,400
But I will have allies and friends before everything.

902
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,620
Friends are on top.

903
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,060
There he goes.

904
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,620
Alright, let's go.

905
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,480
Those who don't win, let's talk about how friendship is the strongest.

906
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,520
Oh, wait, what?

907
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,740
Oh, no!

908
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,420
It's Boo!

909
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,260
Oh, you can grab money.

910
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,680
What will it be?

911
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,600
I think you get Doki's coins.

912
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,720
No, no, no, no.

913
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,680
You should get Kony.

914
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,380
He's the one.

915
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,380
Kony can win it all back in minigames.

916
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,120
I'm gonna talk Boo out of it.

917
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,040
He's gonna kill you instead.

918
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,060
Yeah, he's like, give me your stars.

919
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,340
Can you talk him out of it?

920
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,700
Yeah, he's gonna steal your coins and your items.

921
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,100
Oh, minus nine.

922
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't know if that's what's happening.

923
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,420
I don't think he's gonna be able to afford any stars at this rate.

924
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,280
If it wasn't for Donkey Kong, he can't speak.

925
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,520
But if it was Mario, he would've scared him away.

926
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,560
Look, they got a camera shot on you.

927
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,640
Oh, I think he's winning your money.

928
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,180
Yeah.

929
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,600
You realize I get Boo now, too.

930
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,160
Yeah, so you should...

931
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,860
hit Doki with that.

932
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,720
Wait, why hit me?

933
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,660
What did I do?

934
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,120
I think you should...

935
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,040
What did I do?

936
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,620
I've just been a...

937
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,720
You hit me with the creepy knife.

938
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,100
What?

939
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,940
You literally cancelled it out.

940
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,520
You cancelled it out.

941
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,340
I never forget.

942
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,840
You cancelled it out, so it means nothing.

943
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,620
I know your ass is not mashing.

944
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,480
Give me 50 coins.

945
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,520
I'm mashing the shit out of this.

946
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,680
I got less stolen than you.

947
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,300
That is true, actually.

948
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,180
Wait, she was gaming.

949
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,820
What the hell?

950
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,380
I wasn't even trying to.

951
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,220
Alright, my turn.

952
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,340
Did anybody hear Waluigi freak out there?

953
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,580
He was like, I want that three.

954
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,720
I'm getting that three in.

955
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,080
Alright.

956
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,280
Alright, let's see.

957
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,620
Oh, nine, let's go.

958
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,280
Oh, ten, let's go.

959
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,600
That's crazy.

960
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,560
Twenty-seven?

961
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,160
Alright, see you guys.

962
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,400
Don't you fucking dare.

963
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,560
Yeah, you know who I'm gonna get.

964
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,020
I'm getting my money back.

965
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm getting my money back.

966
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,480
This timeline is the correct one.

967
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,740
That's right.

968
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,080
Give me my money back, Kony.

969
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,420
That's what you get.

970
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,720
You could have chosen to haunt anybody else.

971
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,860
You weren't even mashing.

972
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,720
That's a win.

973
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,480
It's not.

974
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,560
That's just skill diff.

975
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,320
Someone wins.

976
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,940
How the hell did I get overtaken by Doki?

977
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,580
Wait, okay.

978
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,900
What's the board?

979
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,440
Y.

980
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,380
Wait, how many...

981
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,900
Twelve.

982
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,380
Okay, I either get here...

983
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,940
or I get...

984
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:09,860
here.

985
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,320
Okay, I don't have to land.

986
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,960
You know what?

987
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm tired.

988
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,340
I'm gonna make you guys watch even more.

989
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,700
This turn's taking a while.

990
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,580
Yeah, you guys wanna watch even more?

991
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,060
Alright, I'm gonna...

992
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,760
I'm gonna go this way.

993
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,800
It doesn't really matter.

994
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,840
Alright.

995
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,720
You know what?

996
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,380
Fill that shit up.

997
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Fill the...

998
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,380
Fill it up.

999
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,300
Yeah, with the coins I stole from Kony.

1000
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,640
Fill that shit up right now.

1001
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,380
Oh, another creepy face.

1002
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,720
Wow.

1003
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,080
Oh, man.

1004
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,800
I wonder...

1005
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,960
I wonder what I'm gonna do with that.

1006
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
You chose...

1007
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,760
You chose an enemy today.

1008
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,240
I wonder what am I gonna do...

1009
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,600
with that creepy dice.

1010
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,200
That's fine, that's fine.

1011
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,240
That's fine.

1012
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,060
Oh, I get to pick.

1013
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,700
You know what?

1014
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,520
I think one creepy dice is more than enough...

1015
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:17,800
for me.

1016
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Get rid of the double dice.

1017
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,680
No, I think one creepy dice is more than enough.

1018
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,620
I know what I wanna do.

1019
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,480
Targeted harassment to one player...

1020
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,400
with a bunch of creepy dice.

1021
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,900
To be fair, that one player...

1022
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,220
has been a self-proclaimed...

1023
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,160
Mario Party gamer.

1024
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,080
So like, you know, it's not even targeted.

1025
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,900
It's called nerf.

1026
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,280
It's a nerf.

1027
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,300
Treasure divers double coins.

1028
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
Wait, if Kony loses this, his career is over.

1029
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,540
There's no losing on this one, I think.

1030
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,480
Wait, how do I...

1031
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,220
Oh, I have to smash.

1032
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,080
I understand.

1033
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,820
Wait, can I steal from you?

1034
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,040
Oh, okay.

1035
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,160
Okay, I understand now.

1036
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,320
If you go into the shark's mouth, he has a big chest.

1037
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,800
Okay, okay.

1038
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,460
I'll try.

1039
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,200
He's got...

1040
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,920
It's a very big secret in Mario Party.

1041
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,760
Get me out of here.

1042
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,460
Do I have to go straight to the...

1043
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,720
No, I just have to take it above.

1044
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,200
Alright, I figured it out.

1045
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,040
Okay, okay, okay.

1046
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,980
Uh-oh, it's Mr. Big Chest.

1047
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,540
I got one too.

1048
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,180
Why is the blooper targeting me?

1049
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,260
Oh, no!

1050
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,740
All of you, all of you.

1051
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,440
Oh, yeah.

1052
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,340
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1053
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Wait, what is up with the blooper?

1054
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,380
What the fuck?

1055
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,440
Why is he targeting me?

1056
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,160
That's so fucking disgusting.

1057
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,680
That's fine.

1058
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,480
Get away from me.

1059
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,600
Get away from me.

1060
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,120
This is a hate crime.

1061
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:45,780
Get away.

1062
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,040
Okay.

1063
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,660
No!

1064
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,960
Oh, you got so lucky there.

1065
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,380
That's fine, that's fine.

1066
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,840
Is this a plundered treasure?

1067
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,220
Oh, I'm gonna fucking die.

1068
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,580
Body, body, body, body, body, body.

1069
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,240
Body, body, body, no!

1070
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,580
Yeah.

1071
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,220
You almost killed him.

1072
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,620
We could have made him drown, guys.

1073
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,880
We could have drowned him.

1074
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,540
If we all blocked the surface, he couldn't come up.

1075
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,260
Exactly.

1076
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,180
He's already dead anyway.

1077
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,700
It's not like anything bad's gonna happen.

1078
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,540
That's a lot of coins.

1079
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,400
That's fine.

1080
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,960
One of us just has to hit the star.

1081
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,180
Oh, there he is.

1082
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,520
Oh, here he is.

1083
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,760
Five, five, five.

1084
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
Get a two, get a two.

1085
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,880
Get a one or a two.

1086
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,640
Isn't he lucky if he gets one, though?

1087
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,040
Wait, really?

1088
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,880
The clover is up there.

1089
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,120
Should I give him the creepy dice?

1090
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,120
Oh my god.

1091
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,120
He's got it!

1092
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,860
He's got Mario.

1093
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,580
Mario, I love you.

1094
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,900
Mario, say no.

1095
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,920
Mario, say no.

1096
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,440
He gives you money?

1097
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,980
Wait, oh, you have to win.

1098
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,140
Shut up, you have five stars and a tip.

1099
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,640
Wait.

1100
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,760
Oh, if you win.

1101
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,140
So you have to win this mini game.

1102
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,580
But I get an advantage.

1103
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,660
He got an advantage because he's last place.

1104
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,240
No, I got an advantage because I found him.

1105
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,340
No, it's because he's last place.

1106
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:22,940
It's okay.

1107
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,080
We gotta get Mario, guys.

1108
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,400
If you get the main character, you basically win the game.

1109
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,280
I feel like Mario is just a wincon.

1110
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:30,960
Yeah.

1111
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,300
How do we do it?

1112
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,140
Mario is creepy.

1113
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,280
I think this is like three mini games that we play.

1114
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,080
No mini games with your Wi-Fi.

1115
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,880
It's fine, it's just loading.

1116
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,040
Oh, it's this.

1117
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,220
It's flag.

1118
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,920
What does that mean?

1119
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,800
Oh, it's loading.

1120
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,020
So the flag thing is for the other mini games, I think.

1121
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,040
This one is just jumping.

1122
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
How does he know that?

1123
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,940
Oh, so I just move it.

1124
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,720
Oh, wait.

1125
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,300
Oh, I see.

1126
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,500
I see how to play.

1127
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,840
Someone's not hitting it.

1128
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,220
Someone's not hitting it.

1129
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,560
I got locked in.

1130
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,620
I don't know what happened to me.

1131
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,420
I got overtaken by games.

1132
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,060
Mario, you're going down.

1133
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,140
Okay.

1134
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,080
Boom!

1135
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,380
I like that.

1136
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,120
I like that.

1137
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,600
Put that lag switch on right now.

1138
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,720
Put that lag switch on right now so he'll fall.

1139
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,380
Alright, you got it.

1140
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:37,900
Woah!

1141
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,340
He's actually doing it.

1142
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,860
Woah, he's really doing it.

1143
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,140
Wait, he's really doing it.

1144
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,460
Woah!

1145
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,640
It was a joke.

1146
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,060
You have to be joking.

1147
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,220
He's actually lag switching.

1148
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,100
He's actually lag switching.

1149
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,480
That's fucked up.

1150
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,120
Oh my god, again!

1151
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,260
I want to jump!

1152
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:09,540
That is insane.

1153
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,160
That lag was fucking crazy.

1154
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,700
Holy shit.

1155
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
Oh, he stopped the downloads.

1156
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,460
Okay.

1157
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,520
We're stopping the torrents now.

1158
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,760
Who are you downloading, bro, bro?

1159
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,480
Who are you fucking downloading?

1160
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,060
That's insane.

1161
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,700
Oh my god.

1162
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,400
The game's over, restart.

1163
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,720
Calculating.

1164
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,960
We'll figure it out.

1165
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,380
Despite all the adversity.

1166
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,400
Somehow.

1167
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,440
What the hell?

1168
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,760
Yeah, somebody was hitting me hard with that fucking lag.

1169
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,620
That'll be fine.

1170
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,020
Wait, it's not even points.

1171
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,440
That is crazy.

1172
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,700
Oh my god, I'm carried.

1173
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,380
Wait, that's not fair!

1174
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,020
I am carried.

1175
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,180
I'll say it.

1176
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,000
Kill Boo, get red.

1177
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,760
We gotta get red.

1178
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,540
Get Boo, get Boo.

1179
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,480
Get your coin right now, bro.

1180
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,440
1, 2, 3, subscribe to you.

1181
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,700
Get his ass.

1182
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,940
I'm going over.

1183
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,900
Cody, this is your job.

1184
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,320
You're better at this than me.

1185
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:25,640
Oh my god.

1186
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,400
Kill Boo.

1187
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,620
I'm trying my hardest.

1188
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,900
With this lag.

1189
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,620
I'm trying.

1190
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,300
Get it, boys.

1191
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,140
I blame you, Cody.

1192
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,960
I blame you.

1193
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,100
This is your fault.

1194
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,860
Get Boo.

1195
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:43,880
How?

1196
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,320
Get him, Mario.

1197
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,520
Get him, Mario.

1198
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Oh my god, thank god.

1199
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,620
I died for the cause.

1200
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,340
I was lagging, guys.

1201
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,220
That's my reason.

1202
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,520
I'm gonna grab a cough drop while you guys figure this shit out.

1203
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,040
Get him, Mario.

1204
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,680
Get him.

1205
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,180
Kill him, Super Mario.

1206
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,840
That's my goat.

1207
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,420
Mario, we can both win.

1208
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,480
We can just draw here.

1209
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,680
What if Mario wins?

1210
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,440
Then he leaves.

1211
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,260
You guys are losers.

1212
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,460
You lost to me?

1213
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,380
Oh shit, it's you and Mario?

1214
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,140
No, we're friends.

1215
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,240
We're bumping.

1216
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,280
That's fine with me.

1217
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,520
I'll tie with Super Mario.

1218
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,280
Bro, it's not fair.

1219
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,340
Mario's literally an NPC.

1220
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,220
He can't lag.

1221
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,840
No, we're friends.

1222
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,380
You're just vibing.

1223
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
He's kinda strong, though.

1224
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,420
Wait, he's trying to fuck you up.

1225
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,780
We could've been friends.

1226
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,000
We could've been friends.

1227
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,100
Well, well, well.

1228
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,220
Five, three...

1229
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,380
One point for the Boo.

1230
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,560
Oh my god.

1231
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,860
We'll never know how many points Boo gets.

1232
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,680
We'll never know.

1233
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:07,560
Wait.

1234
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,640
Just wait for it.

1235
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,220
Surely I'll get...

1236
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,460
You can come back.

1237
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,260
What the fuck did you just do?

1238
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,780
I think we're able to join back.

1239
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,160
Usually you can join back when you DC.

1240
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,240
It should be fine.

1241
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,200
Let's take one more.

1242
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,580
Yeah, don't worry.

1243
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,580
The NPC will fucking help you.

1244
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,400
I'll go plug it in while you guys do that.

1245
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,220
Okay.

1246
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,240
Left!

1247
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,440
Oh, come on.

1248
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,500
Coney, who do you think I am?

1249
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,480
Okay, I figured it out.

1250
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,480
Where's the mixup?

1251
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,920
Matt, are you streaming?

1252
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:53,780
No.

1253
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,320
Oh no!

1254
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,720
No!

1255
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,860
I'm just like an NPC!

1256
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,060
No!

1257
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,300
I thought the event when he put two out, you press two of it, so I pressed two of it at the same time.

1258
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,980
What is he doing?

1259
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,600
He's gonna kill you.

1260
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,260
He's gonna kill Mario.

1261
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,540
Yeah, what is he thinking about?

1262
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,160
Goodbye, Mario.

1263
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,220
Oh no!

1264
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,160
Oh, this game is never gonna end.

1265
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,760
Not if he goes this slow.

1266
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,320
This game is never gonna end.

1267
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,200
If it's this slow, it's very easy to react.

1268
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,400
Oh yeah, I'm ready.

1269
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,240
Alright, I'm looking.

1270
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,260
Disconnect again!

1271
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,700
Oh, you son of a bitch!

1272
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,400
Alright, bro.

1273
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,960
Oh, nobody wins.

1274
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,940
Hey, hey, great game.

1275
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1276
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,260
Yeah, good game.

1277
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,200
However, I did have one more point.

1278
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh, you do?

1279
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,720
As you know, Super Mario is mine.

1280
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,080
I can't believe this.

1281
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,600
I can't believe it.

1282
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,080
Oh, Mario's so happy.

1283
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,780
He loves me.

1284
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,940
Yeah, Mario was like, thank god I don't have to hang out with that guy.

1285
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,080
Who's smell, bro?

1286
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,960
Oh, he smells terrible.

1287
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,080
Wait, does that mean like nobody...

1288
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,160
I don't think you get him.

1289
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,460
Oh, you get him!

1290
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,880
Hop in!

1291
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,220
Does he just run really fast?

1292
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,560
This is exactly why.

1293
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,760
This is exactly why we give him all the creepy dice.

1294
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,500
Oh, he's so sad.

1295
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,240
I have to get to the star in three turns.

1296
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,300
I don't think that's happening.

1297
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,080
He's so sad.

1298
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,860
Look what you did.

1299
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,240
You made him sad.

1300
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,040
Wait, so is Brawl Pro still out?

1301
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,560
Yeah, he is.

1302
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't know, but it's definitely smoother, I'll tell you what.

1303
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,380
No, the Wi-Fi is a little better.

1304
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,180
I'm doing good now.

1305
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,540
Wait, why did you get a pipe?

1306
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,060
It's useless.

1307
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,440
You don't even know where you're gonna go.

1308
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah.

1309
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,840
I guess you could say that.

1310
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,580
No.

1311
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,660
Alright, I know what I'm gonna do.

1312
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,340
So is it just a computer now?

1313
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:12,980
I guess so.

1314
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,100
Yeah, it's just a computer.

1315
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,460
Oh, he's gonna use his blocks.

1316
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,240
Oh, that's fucked.

1317
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,340
The CPU is really good.

1318
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,200
Yeah, that's true.

1319
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,940
What if it's like the ultra hard mode CPU?

1320
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,440
Oh, shit.

1321
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,380
He's definitely getting the bet.

1322
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:25,820
What?

1323
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,220
Yo.

1324
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,980
Well, he's lapping Brawl Pro, that's for sure.

1325
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,500
I mean, not lapping Coney.

1326
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:33,820
Yeah.

1327
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,020
Oh, did you get somebody in there?

1328
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,700
Oh, he got Jonas.

1329
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,020
Oh, I would've done that then.

1330
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:42,720
I'd quote him.

1331
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,220
Because it was like, wait, he's lapping people.

1332
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,520
Wait, he actually might be a better player than Brawl Pro.

1333
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,300
What if he just spends all his money on dumb bullshit?

1334
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,980
Oh, he gets another triple dice?

1335
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,940
Yeah, this guy's kind of moving.

1336
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,420
Yeah, this guy's kind of smart.

1337
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,080
Alright.

1338
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,740
But watch this.

1339
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,980
Alright, we're watching, I'm watching.

1340
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,740
Come on, Mario has a car.

1341
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,480
You have to get it in three turns.

1342
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,660
I gotta put this down, I guess.

1343
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,140
I'll leave this shit back here.

1344
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:18,800
Versus...

1345
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,640
I'll put it right there.

1346
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,860
Oh, that has double advantage.

1347
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,460
Oh.

1348
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,300
Alright, uh...

1349
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,100
Come on, Mario, let's get a big roll.

1350
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,380
Okay.

1351
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,120
And then plus five.

1352
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,280
Mario, it's go time.

1353
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,220
Put a five on that.

1354
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,260
Okay.

1355
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,280
Wait, uh...

1356
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,640
Go right, go right.

1357
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,120
It's actually tough, cause...

1358
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,800
I only have him for three turns.

1359
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,880
If you go right, you get extra items.

1360
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,800
Yeah, honestly, I would too.

1361
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,540
I would have to give up ten, so it's like, do I do...

1362
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,240
I don't know.

1363
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,040
That went right.

1364
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,980
Alright, my turn.

1365
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:09,860
Okay.

1366
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,580
Oh, I like that you can see the turns on the bottom, I just realized.

1367
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,220
Double dice time.

1368
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,960
Alright, I believe.

1369
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,680
Okay, not that one, but now.

1370
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,380
Yeah, I believe now.

1371
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,400
Eleven, no roll.

1372
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,660
Hey, where are you again, Kony?

1373
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,940
Where are you on the board again?

1374
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,040
I'm working.

1375
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,700
Where are you?

1376
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,260
Can you remind me?

1377
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,040
Okay, let's see.

1378
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,140
I'll grab the...

1379
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:38,880
Oh, I can grab the double.

1380
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,140
This game is way smoother now, all of a sudden.

1381
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,600
Yeah, it feels like we're not lagging anymore.

1382
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,540
Yeah, okay, another double.

1383
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,900
Ain't no way she didn't want the quad dice.

1384
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:52,820
Alright.

1385
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,580
Oh, hey, I'm right next to Brawl Pro.

1386
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,380
Let's go.

1387
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,320
Minigame.

1388
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,840
Uh-oh.

1389
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
Play my favorite game.

1390
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,020
Scare yourself.

1391
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,080
Actually...

1392
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,080
Wait, what's that?

1393
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,500
I don't know.

1394
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,180
It just sounded cool, you know?

1395
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,060
Just for Halloween, yeah.

1396
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,800
Oh, this is scary.

1397
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,940
Oh, you just avoid people.

1398
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,520
You gotta jump over.

1399
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,480
You have a really high jump in this game.

1400
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,580
Alright, I'll figure this out.

1401
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,580
Watch this.

1402
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,520
Wait, why are you guys...

1403
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,360
I'll wait.

1404
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,120
I'll wait my turn.

1405
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,540
It's cool.

1406
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,280
You shouldn't have waited.

1407
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,940
Nothing.

1408
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,480
Yeah, you guys waited.

1409
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,440
Why are you guys waiting?

1410
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,640
Why are you guys so scared?

1411
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,720
Why are you guys...

1412
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
I need you to stop doing that.

1413
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,040
Why are you guys so scared?

1414
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,080
There's like no threat here.

1415
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,320
Yeah, there's no threat.

1416
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,180
We're just walking around.

1417
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,320
It says there's 30 seconds.

1418
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,160
Oh, it's getting fast.

1419
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Oh, I realize...

1420
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,920
Now I know...

1421
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,240
Oh!

1422
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,760
Why did I play slower?

1423
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,660
Okay, okay.

1424
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,320
Guys, wait up!

1425
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,180
Guys, wait up!

1426
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,920
No, no, no!

1427
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:27,340
No!

1428
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,780
Why did you go so fast at the end?

1429
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,720
I was ready!

1430
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,900
That game was too scary.

1431
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,720
That's where the scare was.

1432
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,520
I didn't like that one.

1433
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,860
I liked that one a lot.

1434
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,180
That one was not fun.

1435
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,440
Get up so fast!

1436
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,300
With all that money...

1437
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,260
And no stars...

1438
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:50,860
What's the point?

1439
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,520
But I can get two stars with my good friend, Super Mario.

1440
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,660
I think it really depends on where I'm going to send this card to.

1441
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,560
Only if he gets to hit a star.

1442
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,740
After I take it.

1443
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,880
Oh, he has to double.

1444
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,340
So he could get 10 right here.

1445
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,200
I'm going to put it right in front of me.

1446
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,440
Watch this.

1447
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,860
What do I need?

1448
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,160
I need a 5 and a 5.

1449
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,640
Come on.

1450
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,280
Oh!

1451
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:09,380
Oh!

1452
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,680
What?

1453
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,380
That's so not...

1454
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,200
Oh my god.

1455
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,240
What was it?

1456
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,700
What did you hear?

1457
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,480
Yeah?

1458
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,100
Why?

1459
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,720
Because you're too old?

1460
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,020
And I'm too young?

1461
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,200
Very funny.

1462
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,100
It's a three stooges bit.

1463
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,700
Give me that star.

1464
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,220
Three stooges.

1465
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,580
Well, well, well.

1466
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,720
Is that closer?

1467
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,220
It's like the same distance, I feel.

1468
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,840
Oh, I like that.

1469
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,600
It's the same distance as you?

1470
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,260
It's like gold dice.

1471
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:49,720
Oh my god.

1472
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,180
Oh, I wanted that.

1473
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,780
Hey man.

1474
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,460
If anyone tries to curse dice me, I will be cleansing.

1475
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,200
Alright.

1476
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,860
I know what I'm going to do.

1477
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,100
I'm going to say hi.

1478
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:03,560
Hi.

1479
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:03,920
Waluigi.

1480
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,000
Turn that off.

1481
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,360
Waluigi.

1482
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,220
Yeah, this guy can't roll dice.

1483
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:13,960
Okay, he got it.

1484
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,160
Dude, he's going to get a star.

1485
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,320
Wait, is he?

1486
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:21,900
Oh wait, what?

1487
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,780
He gets a star while not even playing the game.

1488
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,880
He didn't even do anything.

1489
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,440
He's not even here.

1490
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:30,520
He's not here.

1491
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,640
This is bullshit.

1492
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,040
We have to kick him out right now.

1493
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,080
I'm feeling devious behavior.

1494
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,740
Oh my god, where's the next star?

1495
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,980
Oh nice, it's on me.

1496
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,780
Damn it.

1497
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,180
That's right, you're too far.

1498
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:53,960
What?

1499
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,500
I hate a minigame.

1500
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,920
Who wants to fight for a fucking mushroom?

1501
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,680
We don't get to see.

1502
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,120
Oh, I guess the CPU plays it.

1503
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,740
Oh, did he win?

1504
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,560
Come on, Mario.

1505
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,140
I guess let's keep going.

1506
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,420
He's going to leave soon.

1507
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,840
How's that Mario treating you?

1508
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,740
Mario, can you stick around for like two more turns?

1509
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,880
Oh, you have 25.

1510
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,980
Oh, what?

1511
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,200
Wait.

1512
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,960
That's Ash.

1513
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,480
Can you use more than two items?

1514
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,940
Can you use more than two items per turn?

1515
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,660
Wait, I think...

1516
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,860
Well, that's an old mechanic.

1517
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,480
Wait.

1518
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,640
Wait a minute.

1519
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,660
Wait, where's that shop?

1520
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,280
Where's that store?

1521
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,980
Wait a minute.

1522
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,780
You wouldn't happen to have a quadruple dice, would you?

1523
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,400
Wait a minute.

1524
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,680
Good heavens.

1525
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Thank you.

1526
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,980
Wait a minute.

1527
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,320
I need your finest oil, please.

1528
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,720
Wait, two items?

1529
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,180
Wait, you get to have two items?

1530
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
No, I just...

1531
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,880
You might as well get a mushroom ticket now.

1532
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,340
Maybe I'll treat myself.

1533
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,040
Do I want the mushroom ticket or the...

1534
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,260
You might as well get the custom block just in case.

1535
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,540
I think I'll treat myself.

1536
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:16,780
I think I'll treat myself.

1537
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:18,740
Okay.

1538
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,060
Okay.

1539
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,320
No way!

1540
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,080
Oh, wait.

1541
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,560
You better not lose.

1542
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,780
Thank you, Mario.

1543
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,920
Mario got hit too?

1544
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,680
Oh, I don't like that.

1545
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,480
Oh my god!

1546
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,040
And he loses money for you.

1547
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,660
You better not win the next video game.

1548
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:43,920
Alright.

1549
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,240
This is it.

1550
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,080
Oh my goodness.

1551
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,380
This is my only chance to take this from him.

1552
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,480
You gotta.

1553
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,460
Legendary.

1554
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,120
No!

1555
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,840
It's a no!

1556
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,700
I don't even want to watch.

1557
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,260
I don't even want to look at Kony taking this star.

1558
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,240
Why is Mario behind you now?

1559
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,420
Mario has overtaken your game.

1560
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,200
Oh my god.

1561
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,020
I am back, but it doesn't let me join back.

1562
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:14,960
Wait, does he?

1563
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,760
Oh, he's mine now.

1564
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,600
Goodbye, Kony.

1565
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,500
I got Mario.

1566
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,060
I stole Mario from you.

1567
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,160
Yoink!

1568
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,500
He's mine now.

1569
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm so far from you.

1570
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,700
You can't steal it back.

1571
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,300
We gotta get BroPro back in.

1572
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,120
I think we start over.

1573
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1574
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,100
I think we start.

1575
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,300
Alright, we start over.

1576
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,940
Wait, are you sure you can't join back?

1577
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,940
Usually you can.

1578
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,500
Wait, hold on.

1579
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,480
Am I back?

1580
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,340
It says I'm standing by.

1581
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,660
Yeah, it's after it turns over.

1582
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,480
He joins back.

1583
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,100
That's why.

1584
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,460
Oh yeah, because it was taking forever.

1585
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1586
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,500
Wait, how does this work?

1587
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,200
You want to get coins, so you do the turn styles.

1588
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,960
Yeah, if you're on the button, it turns 90 degrees one time.

1589
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,740
Oh, so we just keep pressing it.

1590
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,820
I cannot believe.

1591
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,140
You can't even buy a double star.

1592
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,100
BroPro, you got carried by your NPC.

1593
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,260
Wait, really?

1594
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,020
Did he pop off?

1595
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,380
He literally got you a star.

1596
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,780
He literally got you a star.

1597
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,320
That's my coast.

1598
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,360
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1599
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,760
Yeah, I wanted three, but we'll take the one.

1600
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,980
Okay, nice, nice.

1601
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,620
We got the one.

1602
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,300
That's fine.

1603
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,440
NPC, he knows what he's doing.

1604
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,500
Yeah, you know what to do here.

1605
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,760
Yeah, I got you.

1606
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,120
Yeah, you know what?

1607
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,620
You know what?

1608
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,820
You know what?

1609
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,700
Oh my god.

1610
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,920
Right, right, right, right.

1611
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,020
I mean, that happens.

1612
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,880
Yeah, let's go!

1613
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,280
BroPro would've fucked that up.

1614
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,980
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1615
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,980
I've got the gamer.

1616
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,520
I've got the gamer.

1617
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,400
Let's go.

1618
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,340
Wait, this one's fucked up.

1619
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,620
Hold on, we have to see.

1620
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,080
We have to know what to do based on what the NPC does.

1621
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:18,740
Yeah, yeah, we have to.

1622
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,760
We just got mixed.

1623
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,340
That's crazy, that's crazy, that's crazy.

1624
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,320
Let's go, BroPro.

1625
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,520
BroPC!

1626
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,960
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1627
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,600
Maybe you can just watch.

1628
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,580
He's pretty easy.

1629
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,780
Okay, you make a move, and then I'll make a move based.

1630
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,920
I have to help you.

1631
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,920
Oh my god, it didn't do my input.

1632
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,860
You won't lose anything here.

1633
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,540
That ShyGuy is crazy.

1634
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,540
That's just not fair.

1635
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
That ShyGuy's fucked up, wait.

1636
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:52,800
You know what?

1637
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,400
I'm just doing this, because we need to get something.

1638
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1639
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,960
I told you, that's all you have to do.

1640
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,120
There's no way to beat the CPU, so I'll leave it up to you.

1641
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,580
That's literally all you have to do.

1642
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,420
Oh, great.

1643
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,640
Oh, baby.

1644
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,400
You caught up!

1645
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,200
How many rounds is this?

1646
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,480
It's on the bottom.

1647
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,080
Oh, shit, okay.

1648
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,980
If we both stand... no.

1649
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,760
If we both stand on, I think we're good.

1650
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,100
I didn't copy the bot.

1651
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,120
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1652
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,500
What's going on?

1653
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,160
Are you fucking serious?

1654
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,900
No way, are you serious?

1655
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,440
Brawl PC, what are you doing?

1656
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,020
Those mind games.

1657
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,880
Brawl PC, you were supposed to be gaming.

1658
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,100
That's calling a bot pro.

1659
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,000
I like that.

1660
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,420
Oh, my God.

1661
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,640
And we're off.

1662
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,140
Oh, I didn't react in time, I'm sorry.

1663
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,440
Oh, my God.

1664
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,000
We got major from that.

1665
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:54,420
That was good.

1666
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,260
I can't believe it.

1667
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,640
I blame bot PC.

1668
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,720
The pre-game jump for mind games was the difference maker there.

1669
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,960
Mario for me, my beloved.

1670
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,400
Were you guys actually counting?

1671
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,460
Because I wasn't.

1672
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,520
Matt took first place.

1673
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,400
Oh, yeah, I kind of popped off a little bit.

1674
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,280
It's because he had the star and the coins.

1675
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,460
So you're back in?

1676
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,440
Yeah, let's go.

1677
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,620
We're just starting now.

1678
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,260
Goodbye, Mario.

1679
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,060
Let's go somewhere you don't even know where to go.

1680
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,760
Yeah, it's a random spot.

1681
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,680
You guys want to go on a side quest?

1682
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,500
Craziest play of my life.

1683
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,540
You didn't even earn that.

1684
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,360
Craziest play of my life.

1685
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,400
Wait, and then he can fucking get that star.

1686
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,440
Let me get it.

1687
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,780
I'm fine.

1688
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,200
Unlock the space.

1689
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,140
Move guys immediately.

1690
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,600
Oh, my God.

1691
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,480
What if all of you never make it to the star, though?

1692
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:06,860
Hold on.

1693
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,580
I would say that if I didn't have...

1694
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,400
Turbo Dice.

1695
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,740
It doesn't matter.

1696
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,500
You don't even have Mario.

1697
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,140
I don't have Mario.

1698
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,640
I'm really mad about it.

1699
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:25,960
If you're three to eight spaces away from the star by the end of this turn, we'll know the culprit.

1700
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,920
I'm okay with a hit and run.

1701
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,660
You can't get stars with turbos.

1702
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,300
That's my chat.

1703
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:31,940
Oh, my God.

1704
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,360
God bless you for telling me that.

1705
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,300
Everybody in chat is going to be so mad at you for telling me.

1706
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,280
But I'm glad one person in chat loves me.

1707
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,360
I'm okay with that.

1708
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,800
Hey, that's information for me.

1709
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,840
What if he's lying?

1710
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,540
What if you're getting one guide right now?

1711
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,140
I'll read the item.

1712
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,340
Oh, a lot of coins here.

1713
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,400
Just take everything from him.

1714
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,280
Just take everything.

1715
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,200
You have a lot of coins, man.

1716
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,080
You do have a lot of coins.

1717
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,580
I'm getting 64.

1718
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:06,860
I'm getting 64.

1719
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,380
Can we get 9 from him?

1720
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,960
He's stealing from the rich.

1721
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,260
He's poor right now.

1722
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,440
Thank you.

1723
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,660
It's like you didn't lose any money.

1724
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,260
Give me my money back.

1725
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,300
I did that on purpose.

1726
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,140
Come on, man.

1727
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,460
That's sweet.

1728
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,660
Let me read these item descriptions very carefully.

1729
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,880
Oh, that's crazy.

1730
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,220
I can't believe.

1731
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,680
I can't believe you're getting your hand held by your chat.

1732
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,860
End the two-hour warm-up.

1733
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,940
End the two-hour warm-up.

1734
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:50,880
Exactly.

1735
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,440
Only one guy said it.

1736
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,940
Everybody else in chat wasn't saying anything.

1737
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,260
They wanted you to fail.

1738
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:57,940
That's crazy.

1739
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,120
Yeah, but it's only one star.

1740
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,320
He doesn't even have his friends.

1741
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,740
You know what the saddest thing about this is?

1742
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,100
It's going to move behind you.

1743
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,080
Oh, come on, do it.

1744
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,740
It'll be so funny.

1745
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:11,820
One star, please.

1746
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,920
Thank you.

1747
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,720
That was a good Donkey Kong.

1748
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,860
Now he's in the first.

1749
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,460
Yes, he is.

1750
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,060
Oh my god, Seth Rogen, is that you?

1751
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,540
Two slots for the star on this entire stage?

1752
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,820
Oh, man.

1753
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,560
Why doesn't it go fucking...

1754
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,300
Oh my god, I swear to god.

1755
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,040
Oh, just what I needed.

1756
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,960
Genie, please.

1757
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,140
Oh, a minigame.

1758
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,760
I get to play a fun game.

1759
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,680
Golden pipe, perhaps?

1760
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:45,980
Maybe a golden pipe.

1761
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,680
What is this?

1762
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,880
Stop the wheel.

1763
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,480
What wheel?

1764
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,360
Wait.

1765
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,380
I know this game.

1766
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,900
No.

1767
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,880
What are you going to get?

1768
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,580
I want to know what that gold dice does.

1769
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,360
That one right there, right?

1770
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:06,960
Yeah.

1771
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,300
What'd that do?

1772
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,630
Surely it's...

1773
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,580
What is it?

1774
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,160
Tell your chat to tell you.

1775
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,420
We're the backseaters.

1776
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,060
I didn't understand that game.

1777
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,380
Hello, Mario.

1778
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:30,080
As soon as it hits a line, it has to take it.

1779
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,200
It hurts so bad.

1780
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,520
He's looking at you the way he used to look at me.

1781
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,100
Oh, hey Mario.

1782
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,540
You like being with me instead of him?

1783
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,900
Yeah, don't ya?

1784
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,180
That's alright.

1785
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,080
I knew he couldn't do...

1786
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,540
He couldn't give you what I could give you.

1787
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,340
He's gonna leave you real soon.

1788
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,100
Yeah, but at least he left you first.

1789
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,580
He knows you're no good.

1790
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,640
He knows you're no good.

1791
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,340
Oh, I get a gift from my...

1792
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:00,960
Oh, hey!

1793
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:02,460
You gotta be joking.

1794
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,920
Oh, man.

1795
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:04,900
Thanks, Mario.

1796
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,480
I'm gonna give you what he couldn't give you.

1797
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,000
I need somebody.

1798
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,140
There's gotta be somebody out there for me.

1799
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,760
Oh, okay.

1800
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,080
I have a lot of money, so I can...

1801
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,800
Let's see.

1802
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,340
Oh, I can purchase two items.

1803
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,000
Okay, I'm gonna buy the triple block.

1804
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,260
What's that quadruple one?

1805
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,700
That's the turbo one that Kony didn't use.

1806
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,620
Yeah, so it's turbo, but you can't get stars with it.

1807
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,960
You, like, run past it.

1808
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:31,820
Okay.

1809
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,440
Nah, I'm fine.

1810
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,740
That's bad, then, if you can't get a star with it.

1811
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,100
Yeah.

1812
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,160
Well, I think I'm about to use it next turn.

1813
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,100
And I think it's good, because I'm kind of far away.

1814
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,100
But I don't want to overshoot.

1815
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,720
There's no way you can overshoot.

1816
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,640
Unless you get all tens or some shit.

1817
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,060
Why would you cheat me?

1818
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,460
Oh, how many benefits does Super Mario give you, man?

1819
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,080
You had him for two turns, Kony!

1820
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,300
What do you mean?

1821
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,480
Yeah, I have a bunch of ops.

1822
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,760
You already know how it is.

1823
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:04,500
Snowball?

1824
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:05,900
What's that?

1825
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,900
Oh my god, we're actually gonna beat his ass.

1826
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,980
Yeah, I have a bunch of ops.

1827
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,560
It's okay.

1828
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,960
Wait, he has monkeys?

1829
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,840
Make Snowball...

1830
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,440
Get him!

1831
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,320
Get him!

1832
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,440
Get him!

1833
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,460
Oh, it's like...

1834
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,280
It's dodgeball!

1835
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,560
Get him!

1836
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,980
Why is this 1v3?

1837
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,680
One shot kills.

1838
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,480
What?

1839
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,040
No, not me!

1840
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,180
Broppo literally just hit me.

1841
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,360
That is insane.

1842
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,040
That is insane.

1843
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,460
Why did he friendly fire?

1844
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,120
I got him!

1845
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,600
I got him and he just let him go!

1846
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,220
I'm too scared!

1847
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,480
I'm too scared right now!

1848
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,760
What do you mean?

1849
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,960
One shot, one kill.

1850
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,700
One shot, one kill.

1851
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:55,320
Let's go.

1852
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,960
VTuber of the year, guys.

1853
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,140
This is my highlight clip.

1854
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm sending over.

1855
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,640
Get him!

1856
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,280
This is the clip I'm sending over to the VTuber Awards.

1857
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:09,860
Right there.

1858
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:11,300
Bye!

1859
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,020
Mario's gonna go work on himself for a little bit.

1860
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,120
Aw, Mario left!

1861
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,860
Alright, what can I do?

1862
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,940
We're gonna do...

1863
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,220
Of course.

1864
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,380
Wait, I just realized my next play.

1865
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,560
What are you gonna do?

1866
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,320
Alright, man.

1867
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,200
Oh, no.

1868
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,660
Getting ready to alley-kick.

1869
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,960
Well, it's a little bit stronger than that.

1870
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,200
What does he have?

1871
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,780
He only has the quad dice.

1872
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
Oh, I got something.

1873
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,600
Honk's looking at the board.

1874
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,140
He's thinking right now.

1875
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,660
Why can't I do this?

1876
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,300
He pulled out his bifocals.

1877
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,000
You have a decade!

1878
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,820
Grandpa at the dinner table.

1879
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,680
What's in the news today?

1880
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,860
I'm checking Twitter right now while we wait.

1881
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,680
Happy Endy.

1882
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,140
Got the trifold out.

1883
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,360
Go up, bro.

1884
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,000
Scared.

1885
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:25,660
Yeah, baby.

1886
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,500
What are you scared of?

1887
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,600
It's a kid's game.

1888
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,540
What are you scared of?

1889
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,120
Oh, that's a lot of coins.

1890
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Wait, that's a lot.

1891
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,180
Not even good.

1892
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,460
Alright, let's see what's Coney's big brain idea is.

1893
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,720
Play of the game.

1894
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,590
This dude got the Zelda inventory.

1895
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:45,300
You can't even get it.

1896
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,200
You can't even get it because you need 48.

1897
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,860
Abagados los luches!

1898
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,300
Abagados los luches!

1899
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,500
You're sucking my ass!

1900
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,600
My old man's ass!

1901
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,620
Your value is terrible!

1902
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,180
Get closer!

1903
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:08,560
Where's it gonna go?

1904
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,380
Where's it gonna go?

1905
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,860
Was that a boo?

1906
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,100
Aw, you missed the boo!

1907
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,040
Lowest value ult I've ever seen.

1908
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,660
Was that the play you were looking for?

1909
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,160
That was the play of the game, by the way, guys.

1910
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,560
Right there, that was the play of the game.

1911
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,160
That's insane.

1912
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:34,760
Nice.

1913
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:36,460
Yay!

1914
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,120
21?

1915
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,580
That's pretty big.

1916
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,640
That's where the star is, right?

1917
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,420
Yeah, you got the star right now.

1918
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:45,220
Right?

1919
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:45,920
Yeah, that is.

1920
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,520
Gotta be sure.

1921
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,380
Gotta be sure.

1922
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,360
I have two ults.

1923
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,740
I think there's only two star spots.

1924
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,920
Aw, if only Mario was here right now.

1925
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,300
I thought there were three.

1926
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,260
Because I thought there was two in the back and one in the front.

1927
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,440
Wait, you took...

1928
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:02,940
I mean, maybe.

1929
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:03,900
I just feel like...

1930
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,520
I took the star, so it's gonna move now.

1931
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,420
Okay, where's it gonna go?

1932
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,060
Back up.

1933
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,860
So it goes up now.

1934
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,620
It just goes up and down?

1935
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,300
I thought it'd go...

1936
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,760
Does it not go anywhere else?

1937
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,440
For this map specifically, probably.

1938
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,560
Oh, hey, boo!

1939
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,360
Yo, what's good?

1940
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,680
Oh, hey there.

1941
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,600
Yeah, give me some coins.

1942
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:30,660
You know what?

1943
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:31,360
I have the least.

1944
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:31,860
I have the least.

1945
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,360
I have the least.

1946
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:32,820
Thank you.

1947
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,620
It's just practice.

1948
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,100
It's like bashing.

1949
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,080
It's gonna help in the game that has button bashing.

1950
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,520
There's no way.

1951
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,800
There's no way.

1952
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:47,700
Yay!

1953
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:52,560
I've been unfairly targeted by three miscreants all get... Oh, do the verse.

1954
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,960
Give me my points back.

1955
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:54,740
Yay!

1956
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,200
Who am I versing?

1957
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,080
Who am I versing?

1958
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,860
This is important.

1959
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,480
This is important.

1960
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,180
This is a big minigame.

1961
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,620
Oh, that's a lot.

1962
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,620
Oh, that's a lot of our coins.

1963
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,020
80 coins!

1964
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,100
And it's gonna be my favorite game.

1965
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:21,040
Three!

1966
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,800
Sled to the edge.

1967
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,220
Okay.

1968
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,620
Oh, God.

1969
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,460
Okay, we all know what to do, right?

1970
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,160
We all know he was not...

1971
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,340
I've never seen this one.

1972
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,540
Watch the example closely.

1973
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:33,040
Okay.

1974
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,740
Watch and learn from the toads.

1975
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,180
Oh, it's like...

1976
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,320
Oh, easy.

1977
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,120
Okay, understood.

1978
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,240
It's like that Canadian sport game.

1979
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,440
How do you know though?

1980
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,440
What was that Canadian sport game?

1981
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,160
Watch the example.

1982
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,960
We gotta watch...

1983
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,120
This is the length it'll be at.

1984
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,280
Yeah, this is them.

1985
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,760
Yeah, this is the length.

1986
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,220
Anyone count?

1987
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,200
Yo, red toad went too far.

1988
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,200
Red toad didn't?

1989
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,560
Oh, curling!

1990
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,380
This is curling!

1991
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,560
Alright, alright.

1992
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:09,860
It's just A, I think.

1993
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,900
It's literally curling.

1994
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,840
Okay, I got this.

1995
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,480
You guys are going down.

1996
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:18,820
Oh...

1997
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,380
Oh...

1998
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,220
Oh...

1999
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:24,600
Oh...

2000
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:24,920
Alright, guys.

2001
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,600
Oh, he's so early!

2002
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,020
Damn, we are ass!

2003
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:30,820
No!

2004
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,640
Yo, where is the finish line?

2005
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,680
I heard the click.

2006
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,300
And then I got nervous.

2007
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,260
I got nervous as I heard it.

2008
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,520
We were frightened.

2009
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,500
I think everybody...

2010
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,160
Like one person hit the button and then everybody hit the button.

2011
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,000
Dude,

2012
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:53,860
I was locked in.

2013
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,940
I was counting the seconds.

2014
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,520
It was five seconds exactly.

2015
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,680
I was counting.

2016
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,680
He was counting the fucking seconds.

2017
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,360
To the victor go the spoils.

2018
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,520
Oh my god.

2019
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,340
Yeah, big smiles.

2020
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,000
I can't believe he counted.

2021
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,120
Sorry, bro.

2022
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,220
Minigame it.

2023
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,940
Oh, another minigame.

2024
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,120
It's like a back-to-back minigame.

2025
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,860
Is that a GBA sound?

2026
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:20,680
The Edge.

2027
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,740
Oh, I know the strat in this game.

2028
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:24,760
Wait, what?

2029
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,780
Stamp out?

2030
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,240
Oh my god, is this Mario Party 8?

2031
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,360
You don't know what the strat is?

2032
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,080
You hold down A...

2033
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,560
And then you just jump and you...

2034
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,200
Well, I don't want to give it all away.

2035
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,020
There's a little secret.

2036
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,380
It's like Splatoon.

2037
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:38,420
Splatoon?

2038
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,040
It's Larry Splatoon.

2039
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,700
I'm ready.

2040
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,000
Yo, why is dude AFK on my fucking phone?

2041
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,380
Guys, target green!

2042
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,900
We just need to make sure green doesn't get any color.

2043
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,440
Totally.

2044
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,960
Okay, let's get it.

2045
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,700
Someone said just follow Kony.

2046
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:01,580
No!

2047
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,260
Just follow Kony.

2048
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:08,720
Kony, you ain't ever winning, I promise you.

2049
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,190
I'm satisfied.

2050
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,850
I'm satisfied.

2051
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:43,750
It's all I wanted.

2052
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,790
I'm getting bleed.

2053
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,980
You literally have 88 coins, Kony.

2054
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:59,380
I got 0 coins, you got 10 max.

2055
01:13:59,500 --> 01:13:59,900
It's fine.

2056
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,960
You literally have everything going in for you, Kony.

2057
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,940
I'm gonna pop my ult this round, watch this.

2058
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:07,940
Alright, I'm watching.

2059
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,280
Do the other voice line next time.

2060
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,660
Don't do it, I won't.

2061
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,060
Don't...

2062
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,020
I didn't even hold back.

2063
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,000
I was like, yep, that's Kony.

2064
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,160
Isn't it scaled off of how much you have?

2065
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,260
Dude, I'm fucking Ebenezer Scrooge.

2066
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,240
I've been haunted by like 6 ghosts today.

2067
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,540
This is ridiculous.

2068
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,800
You shouldn't believe in Christmas, Kony.

2069
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,000
I'm not learning the meaning of Christmas, bro.

2070
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,460
You shouldn't believe in Christmas.

2071
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:42,560
Fuck.

2072
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,260
Bowser, take his star.

2073
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,060
They wouldn't know what he does.

2074
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,500
Do the thing where he splits coins.

2075
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:53,600
Do the thing where he like...

2076
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,860
Oh my god, make it so that all coins are equalized.

2077
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,160
Then it's star in a circle, Bowser.

2078
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,300
Not revolution.

2079
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,440
Bowser revolution!

2080
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,440
There you go.

2081
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,800
There you go, that's big.

2082
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,300
Whatever, I'll hold that.

2083
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,820
If it was revolution, I would have been furious.

2084
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,380
Wish it was Bowser revolution.

2085
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,260
It would be so funny.

2086
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,620
Oh, he did the snap.

2087
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,000
That's a good snap.

2088
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,300
That was great.

2089
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,240
Waluigi!

2090
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,040
I hate you, Waluigi.

2091
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,320
Waluigi!

2092
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,160
How do you make that sound?

2093
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,860
It's a left button.

2094
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,080
His ass always looking at the board.

2095
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:40,340
Old man trying to figure out the controls.

2096
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,220
You can literally look at the top left.

2097
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,220
It says 30 steps.

2098
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,980
Oh, nice roll.

2099
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:54,520
All that map looking just to get you to...

2100
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,240
Big strategy.

2101
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,560
Y'all alright?

2102
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,960
Item minigame?

2103
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,720
I hope it's the one he said he didn't understand.

2104
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:03,180
I didn't know what the hell was going on on that one.

2105
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,660
This is curling.

2106
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,980
It's curling!

2107
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,000
It's curling again!

2108
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,040
I wanted that.

2109
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,200
Maybe you should've taken a little bit more time to read there.

2110
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:18,120
Yo, that was a half coin trap card?

2111
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:18,600
That's crazy.

2112
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,560
Waluigi!

2113
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,180
Waluigi!

2114
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,300
Now, peep this one.

2115
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,220
I'm watching the gamer mood.

2116
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:31,800
37?

2117
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,580
I have been waiting for this quad dice block to go.

2118
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,660
Let's see it.

2119
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,560
Yeah, but if he gets 40, he doesn't get the star.

2120
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,700
He gets 4 tens.

2121
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,260
4 tens.

2122
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,040
40.

2123
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,600
4 tens goes past the star.

2124
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:49,520
7?

2125
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,000
1?

2126
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,060
That was Zarya.

2127
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:55,000
That's a pretty good roll.

2128
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,900
That's a good roll.

2129
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:57,880
You know what?

2130
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,160
I admire you.

2131
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,600
This is fast as hell.

2132
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:11,000
You don't stop.

2133
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,200
You don't stop.

2134
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,940
Wait, what do you have?

2135
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,220
Why is Waluigi moving so much?

2136
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,880
He's jamming.

2137
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,240
He's having a good time.

2138
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,340
Morning calories.

2139
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,500
You've got to be joking.

2140
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,560
I have the mushroom.

2141
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,500
Yeah, but that means you've got to use it.

2142
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,280
That means you've got to use it.

2143
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,380
You can't save it.

2144
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,220
I was going to use it anyway.

2145
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,820
It means you've got to use it.

2146
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:40,980
Where do I go here?

2147
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,520
I thought it was a jump pad.

2148
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,240
I hate the creepy dice.

2149
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,920
What is that?

2150
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,340
Wait, guys.

2151
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,180
Remember everything we've been through?

2152
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,580
Remember all the stuff we've been through, chat?

2153
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,820
Someone just got into my chat and said, Why isn't Matt streaming?

2154
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,640
That's a bad sub.

2155
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,740
What do I do?

2156
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,060
I am Jack Jesus.

2157
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,980
Wait, okay.

2158
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,260
I can't move.

2159
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,840
Slowest moving robot.

2160
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,120
Relax.

2161
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,040
It's check-in time.

2162
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,420
It's check-in.

2163
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:27,760
Doki, go down.

2164
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,940
It's check-in time.

2165
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,580
No, no, no.

2166
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,160
It's check-in time.

2167
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,300
We're good.

2168
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2169
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2170
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:41,800
You're such a little bitch.

2171
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,440
You're such a little bitch.

2172
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,560
It's okay.

2173
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,980
I don't care.

2174
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,080
I just wanted to get Kony.

2175
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,360
I just wanted to get Kony.

2176
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,300
It's okay.

2177
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,440
You're such a little bitch.

2178
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,440
That's fine.

2179
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,840
The one that matters.

2180
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,740
It's a moral victory.

2181
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,980
Princess Daisy.

2182
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:38,360
Doki is guaranteed to get Daisy.

2183
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,880
That's crazy.

2184
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,320
Wait, is that the strat to say you're gonna win so you never will?

2185
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,440
Yeah, yeah, you gotta psych yourself up.

2186
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,040
Oh, you just missed the pit stop.

2187
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,580
I ran out of gas before hitting the pit stop.

2188
01:19:59,020 --> 01:19:59,660
I'm out of the race.

2189
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,860
Wait, don't even say nothing.

2190
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,440
Oh my god.

2191
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,740
What do you need to read the board for?

2192
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,920
Bro, he's speculating every game.

2193
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,860
Make a move.

2194
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,200
Just roll!

2195
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,080
Don't tell me he uses the coin trap.

2196
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,120
Ain't no way he uses the double dice.

2197
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,080
Ain't no way he gets a 5.

2198
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,320
Oh, he gets a 2.

2199
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,420
Oh, okay.

2200
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,400
There's no way he's gonna catch up to Kony.

2201
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,780
Oh, he gets a plus 10.

2202
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,200
Every round...

2203
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,860
20, 20.

2204
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:38,760
You get extra.

2205
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,400
Wait, I'm almost first place.

2206
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,840
That's scaling.

2207
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:43,620
That's crazy.

2208
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,230
I don't know the rules.

2209
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:53,350
Items!

2210
01:20:57,590 --> 01:21:01,190
I keep getting cursed by all sorts of maladies today.

2211
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,470
Awesome.

2212
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:07,050
We do this.

2213
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:07,930
We go to the shop.

2214
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,230
We get something real nice.

2215
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:10,270
We splurge a bit.

2216
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:10,770
Okay.

2217
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:16,450
See, now you're forced to use the ticket.

2218
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,810
I did that.

2219
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:18,990
You did that.

2220
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:19,630
You did great.

2221
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:21,410
Oh, he has double?

2222
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:27,830
Bro, get the turbo dice.

2223
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,150
There's no way you get more than 30.

2224
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:34,890
Are these half off because of Daisy?

2225
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,290
No, nobody's got Daisy yet.

2226
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:37,870
Yeah, no.

2227
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:39,090
Daisy is better than you.

2228
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:43,090
For only 10 coins?

2229
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:45,310
I mean, I'd do it.

2230
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,670
Yeah, you can literally get extra money from that.

2231
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,850
You'll lose first place, but whatever.

2232
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:55,550
He still has 15 returns to get first place, so that'll be fine.

2233
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:57,290
15?

2234
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:00,670
Oh, sorry, 5.

2235
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:01,950
I can't read.

2236
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,570
Oh, now you're looking at the map.

2237
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:11,170
Holy old man!

2238
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,210
Boomer alert.

2239
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:19,030
Only boomers read.

2240
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,510
Alright.

2241
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:30,410
I can say hi to Daisy and then everybody else is gonna take her from me anyway.

2242
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:32,190
I will.

2243
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:33,750
The instant I see...

2244
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,390
Look at the totem!

2245
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:37,690
That's how it works, right?

2246
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,010
Hello, Daisy.

2247
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:42,870
It was nice meeting you before I had to lose you.

2248
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:44,330
I forgot.

2249
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:45,790
Fight for her.

2250
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:47,270
It's okay.

2251
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,310
I didn't even want Daisy anyway.

2252
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,540
It's fine.

2253
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,180
She doesn't need to be my sidecar.

2254
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:01,100
Wait, but if I get her, then I get two stars next turn.

2255
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,080
You guys know what to do, guys.

2256
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,580
Daisy's fielding.

2257
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:08,240
The fuck is this?

2258
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,320
What do you mean?

2259
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,920
Explain why.

2260
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,420
You skipped the text too fast.

2261
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,880
Collect medals in four events.

2262
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,940
Red medals are worth three points each.

2263
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,140
Okay.

2264
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:22,840
Daisy, give it to me.

2265
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:23,980
Come on, young lady.

2266
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,580
We gotta work together so Kony gets zero points, guys.

2267
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,220
We're not even playing.

2268
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:30,780
Thank you.

2269
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,300
Thank you, kitty.

2270
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,860
I'm locked in.

2271
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,760
I get three medals at the start.

2272
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:38,140
Let's go.

2273
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,260
That's like nine points.

2274
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,080
Yay!

2275
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,760
Okay, but it's not gonna matter, though.

2276
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,500
Daisy, can I have a red one, please?

2277
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,500
Can I have that?

2278
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,320
Thank you.

2279
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,560
Yeah, let's go.

2280
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,140
I don't even want Daisy.

2281
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,360
Oh, my God.

2282
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,440
Oh, now you don't want it.

2283
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,840
I don't even like Daisy.

2284
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,680
Oh, what has Daisy done to you, huh?

2285
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,380
You won't give me any red coins.

2286
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,120
Well, that's not her fault.

2287
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,860
Is she so obligated to give you a red coin just because she has them?

2288
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,040
Oh, yes.

2289
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:13,620
Thank you, Daisy.

2290
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,840
Yeah, she knows I'm a bad boy.

2291
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,920
She knows I'm a bad boy.

2292
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:22,920
Wait, what?

2293
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,300
They went open world.

2294
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,000
What the fuck?

2295
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:28,720
They got no red coins.

2296
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,340
What's going on?

2297
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,300
What is this respawn?

2298
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,440
Why does it take ten hours?

2299
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,560
Yes, I got it.

2300
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:37,240
Oh, man.

2301
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,200
No!

2302
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,120
Put me back in!

2303
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,160
Put me back in, Daisy!

2304
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,640
I'll turn around right now.

2305
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:45,360
That was your mind.

2306
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,260
I can't believe you chased me instead of just going to that plant.

2307
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:49,960
Malicious.

2308
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,620
You have 37.

2309
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,280
How many?

2310
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,780
Oh, my God.

2311
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,040
My numbers going quite foolish indeed.

2312
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,160
Red, let's go.

2313
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,320
This is a scam.

2314
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:04,520
Red coin, please.

2315
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,280
Oh, my God.

2316
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,280
I'm not getting that, though.

2317
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,260
That's way too risky.

2318
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:10,280
Why do I jump further than I'm actually jumping?

2319
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,020
Get away from me!

2320
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,660
Thank you.

2321
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:16,860
No, that's mine.

2322
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:17,160
Sorry.

2323
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,040
That's mine.

2324
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
That's mine, too.

2325
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,140
That's mine.

2326
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,020
Yeah, let's go!

2327
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,440
Great games, everyone.

2328
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,220
Wait, she's winning?

2329
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,180
Guys, we can't let Doki win.

2330
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:31,820
No, no.

2331
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:35,000
I'm just a little guy.

2332
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:35,900
Give it to Doki.

2333
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,360
That's just a little guy.

2334
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,160
Guys, this is...

2335
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:44,280
What have I done to you guys?

2336
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,680
Why does Duke have all the red coins?

2337
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,620
Why does Cleveland flush away?

2338
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:50,380
Let me down.

2339
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:54,020
You're not getting that one either, Cody.

2340
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,480
Target Cody!

2341
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:57,240
Target Cody!

2342
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,020
Fight!

2343
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,400
Fight!

2344
01:25:58,960 --> 01:25:59,120
Fight!

2345
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:04,060
Unbelievable game.

2346
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:06,540
I absolutely love Targeted Mario Party.

2347
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,940
That was very difficult.

2348
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:14,720
Now send that Gamer of the Year clip over to YouTuber Awards, too.

2349
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,040
Right there.

2350
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,000
Yay, Daisy!

2351
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,660
Now we're best friends!

2352
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,780
I'm gonna go this way because I get $20.

2353
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,720
And I get a pipe!

2354
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:34,620
Let's go!

2355
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,000
I don't need a no.

2356
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,600
Oh, and I get a second one, too?

2357
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,280
Oh, I got another pipe.

2358
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:47,220
That's fine.

2359
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:47,780
That's fine.

2360
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,620
Cody, how come you haven't crashed out?

2361
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:52,380
Don't worry.

2362
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:54,640
God is good and just.

2363
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:59,080
Big Top Quiz.

2364
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,280
We're always getting the money mini-games.

2365
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,180
I think it has an ice rink.

2366
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,920
Oh, okay.

2367
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,640
Ow!

2368
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,100
We just roll around.

2369
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,460
Wait, what happens when we hit the snow?

2370
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,940
We all know what to do, guys.

2371
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:19,460
Thank you.

2372
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,060
Oh, that's fucking right.

2373
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:25,400
I think Brawl Pro is locked in right now.

2374
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,540
I think he's locked in.

2375
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,420
He's locked in right now.

2376
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:34,540
He's waiting until the timer ends before he fucking crashes.

2377
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:37,480
Let's go.

2378
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,560
Who's getting that red coin first?

2379
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:41,440
Alright, that's all.

2380
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:42,080
I'm going in.

2381
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,480
It's mine.

2382
01:27:43,660 --> 01:27:44,000
It's mine.

2383
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,040
Thank you.

2384
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,420
Oh my god.

2385
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,340
Are we really going to let him get that?

2386
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,860
Yeah, we have to because he's too good.

2387
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,720
If we went for it, we wouldn't get it.

2388
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:54,360
Alright, open that up for me, Batman.

2389
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,220
Thank you.

2390
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,440
I saw that, too.

2391
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,680
Wait, who got it?

2392
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,080
I don't even know who got that one.

2393
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,860
I can't even see who got it.

2394
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,180
Thank you.

2395
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,160
Yeah, alright, dude.

2396
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,340
Alright, nice.

2397
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,340
Doki won?

2398
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:18,300
I did it because I wasn't greedy for the red coins.

2399
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,240
I got the other coins.

2400
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:20,920
Awesome.

2401
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:21,880
Her ass cheating.

2402
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:25,560
Yeah, I noticed there were no coins on the screen so I had to go for the red coins.

2403
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,480
We had an agreement.

2404
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,580
You guys were all too greedy.

2405
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,600
You guys were just all too greedy.

2406
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:36,960
And now comes my mythical third.

2407
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,880
Oh, only five turns.

2408
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:42,560
Homestretch.

2409
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:43,640
What does that mean?

2410
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,860
It means something happens.

2411
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,620
Is this where they ask someone who's gonna win?

2412
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,860
Oh, it's the predictions.

2413
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:54,280
Oh, and then the last place person gets extra items, right?

2414
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:55,580
Yep, I like that.

2415
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,320
Red space is that.

2416
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:58,960
And dual.

2417
01:28:58,960 --> 01:28:59,560
And dual.

2418
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:02,700
A special event for Homestretch.

2419
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,480
One player receives a mushroom.

2420
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,600
Oh no.

2421
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:10,320
What did you get?

2422
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:10,960
What did we get?

2423
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,300
Oh, that's scary.

2424
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,320
Oh, it's just more Bowser.

2425
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,140
Oh, it's only that many.

2426
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,320
Oh, it's not that many.

2427
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,620
I wish we got the star seal.

2428
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,980
The star seal looks good.

2429
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,720
Yo, where's my freebie?

2430
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,440
I'm fourth, hello?

2431
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,800
Oh, I guess he doesn't care about you.

2432
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,840
I guess you got...

2433
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,020
Whoa, whoa, man.

2434
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,620
You got the stop, though.

2435
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,620
You get to refill items.

2436
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:42,820
Fill her up.

2437
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,700
Gotta give me something good here.

2438
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,700
You know, I haven't gone there one time yet.

2439
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:47,620
Double dice.

2440
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,140
Oh, again?

2441
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,240
Oh, creepy dice.

2442
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,040
You know what to do.

2443
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,080
I do.

2444
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,600
Oh, two creepy dice.

2445
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:57,640
You know what to do.

2446
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,400
You're fourth place, you just sabotage everyone else.

2447
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:02,940
That's my plan.

2448
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:07,600
You know what to do with that creepy dice.

2449
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,060
I hate the creepy dice.

2450
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,180
It's too scary.

2451
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,280
It's spooky scary.

2452
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,220
Yeah, better not get a two.

2453
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,280
That'd be some crazy shit, man.

2454
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,280
You just get it back?

2455
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,740
I think you just get back the money.

2456
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,920
I think you get rewarded.

2457
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,580
You get nothing.

2458
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,580
Oh, it just uses it.

2459
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,500
Does it use it?

2460
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,780
No, he just got booted off.

2461
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,200
Okay, yo, let's go.

2462
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,280
He's closer to the star now.

2463
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:49,400
Let's see.

2464
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,260
What do you need?

2465
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,420
You need nine.

2466
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:54,660
You gotta use that mushroom.

2467
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,320
Yeah, I need nine.

2468
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:58,660
Wait.

2469
01:30:59,020 --> 01:30:59,840
Can I use two items?

2470
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:00,720
No, I can only use one.

2471
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:01,800
So I have to do this.

2472
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,980
You gotta get four or more.

2473
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,560
The love of God.

2474
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,300
Please.

2475
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,620
Please.

2476
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,800
How do you make him do it?

2477
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:12,780
Please.

2478
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,100
Please.

2479
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:17,220
No!

2480
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,260
It is just.

2481
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,980
Yup, this is how the game was always gonna go.

2482
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,800
Thank you.

2483
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,420
One star, please.

2484
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,520
Someone get that swap.

2485
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,520
Is there like the swap thing on this board?

2486
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,320
Where you can swap stars with people?

2487
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:35,420
I got a star.

2488
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,560
Alright, we know what to do.

2489
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,700
Are we going into the boo era of Mario Party?

2490
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,920
Okay, it's at the bottom.

2491
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,680
Okay, where is that?

2492
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:48,120
It's at the bottom.

2493
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:52,360
Oh, and he gets another item.

2494
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,880
And he gets a triple dice?

2495
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,520
That's pretty good.

2496
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:57,860
This is why you're cursed.

2497
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,160
This is why we all curse you.

2498
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,580
Because I've used a bunch of them, which means there's probably one more.

2499
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:03,700
That's pretty good.

2500
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,860
Alright, Daisy, you know what to do.

2501
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,960
The sight of Daisy with Waluigi makes me sick.

2502
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:10,720
That's right.

2503
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,180
Waluigi could never.

2504
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,240
Wait, you could've used a pipe.

2505
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:18,780
No.

2506
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:25,380
I don't know where the fucking pipe goes.

2507
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,240
She's gonna get money for this.

2508
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,040
Yay!

2509
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,820
Plus ally, no?

2510
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,860
Yeah, yeah, and you get another 20.

2511
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:33,700
I get 22?

2512
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:34,880
Yeah, I get another 20.

2513
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,640
Holy fuck.

2514
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,640
The economy is in fucking shambles.

2515
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,440
Oh, and I get to jump up?

2516
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,320
The highest value dice roll.

2517
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,640
That is such high, yeah.

2518
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,100
I'm back here now.

2519
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,100
Now I'm over here.

2520
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,820
But you didn't get the store, and now you have all that money.

2521
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,500
Wait, who's behind me?

2522
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,640
There's somebody behind me.

2523
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:57,860
I think it's me.

2524
01:32:59,340 --> 01:32:59,820
Oh.

2525
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,680
Oh, no.

2526
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:02,940
Dominic?

2527
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:04,920
Me every single day.

2528
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,120
What is modern warfare?

2529
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:08,940
It's mash A, that's it.

2530
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:10,140
Oh.

2531
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,480
I'm not winning this one.

2532
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:13,820
I think...

2533
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,640
Mash the button for 10 seconds.

2534
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:17,940
Then watch the... Okay, fine.

2535
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,660
Alright, we know...

2536
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,960
Coney's been practicing this.

2537
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,080
I literally saw Coney do this.

2538
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,520
Coney's been practicing this for like 200 boosts.

2539
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,280
Oh my god.

2540
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:31,400
Oh my god.

2541
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:34,560
My fingers are tired.

2542
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:39,920
What did you guys do?

2543
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,380
I don't know.

2544
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,080
Probably not 108.

2545
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,280
Yeah, probably not 108.

2546
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:47,860
What?

2547
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:50,000
I'm still lagging.

2548
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,280
I'm still lagging.

2549
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,000
Oh my god.

2550
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,280
No.

2551
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,280
He's gonna die.

2552
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:57,340
No.

2553
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,220
Oh my god.

2554
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:01,660
Oh, no.

2555
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:04,500
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

2556
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,280
He was sharking me.

2557
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,240
He was really good at button mashing.

2558
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:12,580
This joycon button is tiny.

2559
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,780
How do you even mash the joycon button?

2560
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:20,940
I took the joycon and I literally just strained my brain so that my finger would move back and forth.

2561
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,860
Pro is on the joycon.

2562
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,700
That's different.

2563
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,340
I thought I had to be because...

2564
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,120
I thought there were minigame things.

2565
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:32,820
Lost the joycon.

2566
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,660
Joycon's better.

2567
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:35,740
Don't.

2568
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:37,320
Dude.

2569
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,380
For what?

2570
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:39,880
I have a triple dice.

2571
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,740
It won't change a thing.

2572
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,460
You guys are petty.

2573
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:50,760
Awesome, man.

2574
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:51,840
Great.

2575
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,780
What's this?

2576
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,840
I hope it kills you.

2577
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,900
I hope it gives me a free star for no reason.

2578
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,740
Electrocute it.

2579
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,660
What is going on?

2580
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,120
I have good energy.

2581
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,640
This is a big thing.

2582
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,000
This is a whole thing.

2583
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,080
What?

2584
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,560
What just happened?

2585
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,240
I just changed the whole map.

2586
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:21,920
That's weird.

2587
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,240
Alright, alright.

2588
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,280
That's strange.

2589
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,000
Yo, hold on.

2590
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:27,540
Where am I?

2591
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,240
Oh my god.

2592
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:31,860
Pro's lost.

2593
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:35,960
We've gone around the track 30 times and he's still lost.

2594
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:36,280
Where's the star?

2595
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,420
I'm just looking for the star.

2596
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:39,540
That's crazy.

2597
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,200
We've gone around this so many times, man.

2598
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,540
I'm looking for the star, man.

2599
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,780
Yo, there are two places for this.

2600
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,180
It's been in the same two places all game.

2601
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:56,200
How do I...

2602
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,020
Wait, I'm on the pro controller.

2603
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:58,960
Hold on, it's not.

2604
01:35:59,020 --> 01:35:59,840
How do I get out of this?

2605
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:00,440
Okay, there we go.

2606
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,200
I switched from the Joy-Con just now.

2607
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,600
Alright, I'll take it.

2608
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,340
Oh, he took Daisy.

2609
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:10,980
Wait.

2610
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:11,980
Wait, how?

2611
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,120
If you just overtake the player, you take the ally.

2612
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:17,220
Oh, that's sick.

2613
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,760
Aw, dude, but I gotta go fight Bowser if I want the star.

2614
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:22,920
Go for it.

2615
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:23,880
You kill him.

2616
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,920
You gap him, coach.

2617
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:27,340
Get him.

2618
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:30,840
But if he takes the star from me, it's not gonna...

2619
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:31,720
He won't do that.

2620
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,600
Wait, so Daisy also?

2621
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,720
Wait, what if he doubles it?

2622
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,940
Like, he takes two punishments because Daisy's there?

2623
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:38,900
Oh, true.

2624
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:41,940
Receive a thousand points?

2625
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,400
They will never give that to you.

2626
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,340
Even if you land it.

2627
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,300
Oh, man!

2628
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,040
You should lose two stars.

2629
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,540
You know what?

2630
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,960
I think you probably should have looked at the map and known that Bowser was there and not gone.

2631
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,480
Maybe it wasn't worth it.

2632
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:01,840
Maybe, yeah.

2633
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,640
Maybe getting that was definitely...

2634
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,300
You know what?

2635
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,660
Deserved for stealing her.

2636
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,340
Fucking deserved.

2637
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:10,660
Yeah.

2638
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,020
Wait a minute!

2639
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,480
Let's go!

2640
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,900
He did it!

2641
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,100
This is...

2642
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,940
What is this?

2643
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:22,860
That's what you get.

2644
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,000
Deserved.

2645
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:27,600
He's not from Illusion.

2646
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,320
He's not.

2647
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,280
I don't even have any coins.

2648
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:32,000
You got a star!

2649
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,880
He gives you 20 coins because you're broke.

2650
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,280
Broke.

2651
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:48,380
Yo, can you refund this?

2652
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,400
After this stream.

2653
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,020
Alright, bro.

2654
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:53,900
Get this cursed dice off me.

2655
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,640
Watch this.

2656
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,480
It's high noon.

2657
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:08,140
Wait, you can cast on the cursed dice if you use your own items?

2658
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:10,180
Well, well, well.

2659
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,180
Look who it is.

2660
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,240
She started it.

2661
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,220
Literally, she started it.

2662
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:23,900
Literally, she started it.

2663
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,740
Literally, she started it.

2664
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:26,980
You know what?

2665
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:27,900
I'm hitting random.

2666
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:31,380
Come on!

2667
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:32,380
Bro!

2668
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:36,000
Remember who sabotaged you in the minigames?

2669
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:39,340
Remember who sabotaged you in the minigames, Kony?

2670
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:40,740
Remember who it was?

2671
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:41,720
Both of you did.

2672
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,040
No, no, I didn't do anything!

2673
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,380
I'm not denying that.

2674
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,000
I did that.

2675
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:48,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

2676
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:51,980
I remember Kony did it like three times.

2677
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,220
Kony did it first, though.

2678
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,620
Good luck, everybody.

2679
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,700
It's not me.

2680
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,140
Oh, come on.

2681
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:58,300
Yes!

2682
01:38:59,540 --> 01:38:59,960
Yes!

2683
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:01,960
Oh, no!

2684
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:05,660
Well...

2685
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:06,120
Goodbye.

2686
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:08,140
There's your buddies, by the way.

2687
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:09,960
Thanks for the star.

2688
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:13,060
Delicious.

2689
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,000
Big smiles.

2690
01:39:21,740 --> 01:39:23,140
Lose a star!

2691
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,920
Lose a star!

2692
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:26,780
Oh, wait.

2693
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:28,260
Wait a minute.

2694
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:30,860
Wait.

2695
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,900
Um, hey.

2696
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,960
Donkey Kong is so scary!

2697
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,660
Lose a star!

2698
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,940
Lose a star!

2699
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,860
Lose half!

2700
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,040
Oh, it doesn't matter.

2701
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,300
He's broke.

2702
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,220
He's broke.

2703
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:47,880
It doesn't matter.

2704
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:50,440
I ain't got no money anyway.

2705
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,260
So long!

2706
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:52,340
Goodbye, everyone.

2707
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,380
God, it would've been so funny if you lost that star.

2708
01:39:56,140 --> 01:40:00,040
Bro, it's like back-to-back Bowser space, too.

2709
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,380
That shit's scary.

2710
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,510
Alright, I'm gonna use my mushroom.

2711
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:08,580
I need this.

2712
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,960
Give me that mushroom.

2713
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:14,820
Okay.

2714
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:16,880
Come on.

2715
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,340
It's a one.

2716
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:18,660
No!

2717
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,820
Fuck you!

2718
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,840
Fuck you, guys!

2719
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,020
Here we are again.

2720
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:27,660
Fuck you.

2721
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,320
Yup.

2722
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:30,740
That's tough.

2723
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:35,400
Am I two spaces behind or nah?

2724
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,360
I'm gonna get rid of this.

2725
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,900
This is actually...

2726
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,520
This fucking sucks.

2727
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,740
Oh, I get another item!

2728
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:46,460
Okay.

2729
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,520
Gold pipe.

2730
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,160
I don't think there is anything on this map.

2731
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:53,760
Oh, there's not?

2732
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:54,620
There's definitely not.

2733
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:57,540
I don't want any of them.

2734
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,540
They're all pretty bad.

2735
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:00,780
Oh, no!

2736
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:02,860
I'm confused!

2737
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:07,720
I had no fucking way they expected to do that, by the way.

2738
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:09,540
Mood!

2739
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,600
Maybe I just don't have the brain for it.

2740
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,440
Maybe you just can't.

2741
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,260
Your eyes don't see more than 50 frames.

2742
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:22,280
That's called being a gamer.

2743
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:24,900
Alright, I'm getting rid of the...

2744
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,220
Yeah, I lost my gamer privileges.

2745
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:26,980
The pipe.

2746
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:31,060
Minigame!

2747
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:33,900
Yay, minigame!

2748
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:38,280
Waluigi!

2749
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:38,500
Waluigi!

2750
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:41,660
Waluigi!

2751
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,020
Big top quiz!

2752
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,820
Oh, Matt failed high school.

2753
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,680
What the fuck are you talking about?

2754
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,980
Or are you just maliciously lying?

2755
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,700
Study the images on the balls and then answer the questions.

2756
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:52,560
The fuck?

2757
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,900
There are two buzzy beetles and one sheep sheep.

2758
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,540
It's probably going to be like...

2759
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,160
They're not the buzzy beetles!

2760
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:02,900
They're just fucking top whatevers.

2761
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,600
Beetles and fish.

2762
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,700
Which were their...

2763
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,900
That's the quiz.

2764
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,280
Alright, it's just memory.

2765
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,320
It's just memorization.

2766
01:42:18,740 --> 01:42:20,400
What is it?

2767
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,260
Crabs.

2768
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,560
Three crabs.

2769
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:27,760
They're kind of good at this.

2770
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,000
Doki, stop.

2771
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:29,620
Four crabs.

2772
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,900
Wait, I can literally cheat.

2773
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,620
We can...

2774
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:39,220
Well, maybe whoever gets it first.

2775
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:40,720
We can literally cheat.

2776
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:45,220
Oh, it's whoever gets it first.

2777
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:46,500
Oh, okay.

2778
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,100
Follow Kony.

2779
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,200
I'm just going to follow him.

2780
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,920
I don't even need to read this.

2781
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,180
I'm not even going to read it.

2782
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:06,380
The fuck is that?

2783
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,300
That's a buzzy beetle.

2784
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,140
What?

2785
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:10,960
What?

2786
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:13,960
Fuck, I was slow.

2787
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,020
I was like, who's waving?

2788
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:19,660
Oh wait, it's me.

2789
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,480
I thought I was Waluigi.

2790
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:24,340
He thought you were Waluigi.

2791
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:26,620
I'm usually Waluigi in Mario Party.

2792
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,720
Alright, I don't know what to do.

2793
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:32,980
I don't even need to think anymore.

2794
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:37,060
Yeah, I actually can't lose now, so I'm going to let you guys play.

2795
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:37,820
Okay.

2796
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:38,980
Is that me?

2797
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,320
Oh, that's you!

2798
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:41,960
Is that PokeKong?

2799
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:42,460
Okay.

2800
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:48,290
Bro, I already forgot what's what.

2801
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:49,490
What are these?

2802
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:51,230
What are these?

2803
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:53,470
Oh, right here.

2804
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:54,970
Yay!

2805
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:56,970
Your mouse was already on him!

2806
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,770
Wait, that's right!

2807
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:59,570
That's cheating!

2808
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:01,350
You're literally above it!

2809
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:06,990
I just picked the first one I saw, and I was hoping you guys would just pick it because I picked it because I was going to win anyway.

2810
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:07,650
And then I got lucky.

2811
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:11,130
Oh yeah, sure, that's how it goes.

2812
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:13,930
Great game, everybody.

2813
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:21,710
Guys, guys, just remember, he had two hours to play this, grinding this game before the clap, guys.

2814
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,770
Just remember, guys.

2815
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:26,910
No, no, no, no.

2816
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:28,930
I just saw you on the minigame, babe.

2817
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:30,830
Alright, you know what, coach?

2818
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:32,630
Take that Daisy right now.

2819
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:34,350
Oh, she left.

2820
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:35,110
Goodbye, Daisy.

2821
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:38,370
What was your double?

2822
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:40,030
That's good.

2823
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:41,870
Now nobody can have her.

2824
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:43,090
No, that's bad!

2825
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:46,670
She was going to leave me.

2826
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:48,490
She left me once already.

2827
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,850
She was going to leave me again.

2828
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:50,730
I don't trust her.

2829
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,770
You can't trust nobody.

2830
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:03,590
All they do is lie.

2831
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:06,550
What do we have?

2832
01:45:08,650 --> 01:45:10,670
Oh, you can move the star.

2833
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:13,390
Wait, what's the glove?

2834
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:16,530
I think the treasure chest steals an item from someone else.

2835
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:18,410
This is a steal item.

2836
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,410
This is minus two stars.

2837
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:22,710
Wait, get the stars!

2838
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:23,310
Get the stars!

2839
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:26,830
That might be my only way to win, yeah.

2840
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:31,790
Bro, ain't no way you're getting two stars.

2841
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:32,890
Relax, okay?

2842
01:45:33,070 --> 01:45:34,050
You're wasting your money.

2843
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:36,010
Yo, but...

2844
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:37,590
Right now.

2845
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:42,390
You're not even going to have the time.

2846
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:43,790
What do you mean?

2847
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:44,650
There's two turns.

2848
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:46,190
There's one turn and I'm first.

2849
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:46,970
This is the turn.

2850
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:47,810
Lose your coins.

2851
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:49,510
Take away his coins.

2852
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:51,030
Come on, bro.

2853
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:54,490
Come on, low roll.

2854
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:55,370
Come on.

2855
01:45:56,370 --> 01:45:58,210
Five, four, three, two, one.

2856
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:00,450
Yay!

2857
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:08,010
And it goes to the top!

2858
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:09,390
Doesn't matter!

2859
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,050
Good game, bro.

2860
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:14,290
Yay!

2861
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:17,950
He's not a star.

2862
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:27,410
I hate that the stars only go up and down.

2863
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:30,110
Yeah, I'm just sort of going everywhere.

2864
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:30,910
Yeah.

2865
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:33,510
What a lucky duck.

2866
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:34,390
Look at you.

2867
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:36,030
Oh, look at you.

2868
01:46:36,830 --> 01:46:38,710
He's even luckier than the...

2869
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:40,770
than the NPC right now.

2870
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:45,850
Ever since the NPC took over, he's been, like, so lucky.

2871
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:47,190
Watch this.

2872
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,550
The Brawper just got that star.

2873
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:50,110
It will be mine in two turns.

2874
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:51,610
Yo, leave me alone, dude.

2875
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:52,010
Come on.

2876
01:46:52,630 --> 01:46:55,270
I think we put this right about...

2877
01:46:56,110 --> 01:46:58,290
Right on the Bowser's face?

2878
01:46:58,670 --> 01:46:59,870
Wait, isn't that chance time?

2879
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:00,850
That's good.

2880
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:03,070
Get the fuck out of here.

2881
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:06,270
Just in case I do lose something.

2882
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,870
Can I do two?

2883
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:09,170
So it's just if you land on it or if you cross it too?

2884
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:10,430
You land on it.

2885
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:11,490
You have to land on it.

2886
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:13,250
Then I'm not worried about it.

2887
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:14,690
Well...

2888
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:16,570
Sure.

2889
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:18,090
Alright.

2890
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:22,570
Bro, who's the closest to the other star?

2891
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,750
Wait, no, Matt can get the other star, actually.

2892
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:27,870
If I roll high.

2893
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,170
Alright.

2894
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:33,730
I'm just gonna keep using my mushroom until something good happens to me.

2895
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:38,250
Wait, how many vouchers do I have?

2896
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,910
It's like four, I think.

2897
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:42,370
It says it's anywhere from two to four, I think.

2898
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:43,170
Oh, shit.

2899
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:46,090
Oh, if only I got that last roll.

2900
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:49,550
Ah, shit, I should've gone up.

2901
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:53,730
Oh, Doki, you can steal stars.

2902
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:57,450
Well, next turn.

2903
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:02,090
What are you worried about, Mr. One Star?

2904
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:04,570
As if I'm doing any better.

2905
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:09,610
It's a catch.

2906
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:11,290
So, you know.

2907
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:12,250
Remember that.

2908
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:15,210
I know what I want.

2909
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:17,090
Get him!

2910
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,450
Get him!

2911
01:48:19,810 --> 01:48:20,530
What am I doing?

2912
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:21,690
Other way, coach.

2913
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:23,650
What's going on?

2914
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:25,210
Oh, you guys are trying to catch me.

2915
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:28,550
Guys, guys, guys.

2916
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:30,770
Mix up, mix up.

2917
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:34,190
Guys, guys, I don't know if I should be the button presser.

2918
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:34,930
What?

2919
01:48:34,930 --> 01:48:35,970
Snoople!

2920
01:48:36,670 --> 01:48:38,370
How did I not get in?

2921
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:40,210
Doki, lock in.

2922
01:48:40,450 --> 01:48:41,530
I'm trying.

2923
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:44,070
We go up.

2924
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:45,810
He's locked.

2925
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:48,230
Guys, guys, guys.

2926
01:48:48,530 --> 01:48:49,390
Guys, please.

2927
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:52,470
Guys, I need you.

2928
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:54,550
Guys, we're not even above him.

2929
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:55,530
How the fuck am I?

2930
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:57,010
Guys, please.

2931
01:48:57,650 --> 01:48:58,610
Guys, guys.

2932
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:04,150
Doki, you catch the boo, not the fish.

2933
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:06,810
I'm trying, you're not even on top of him.

2934
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,570
Oh my god.

2935
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:11,310
Guys, guys, come on.

2936
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:13,610
Guys, that wasn't my fault.

2937
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:14,550
I blamed it.

2938
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,370
It was never on top of him, guys.

2939
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:17,770
What a play by your boy.

2940
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:20,710
Average Canadian awareness.

2941
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:22,390
Amazing.

2942
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:24,310
Canadian awareness.

2943
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:26,150
I blame...

2944
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:29,510
I blame the guys that couldn't get the cage on top of the boo.

2945
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,770
That's all I'm saying.

2946
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,190
Can you imagine that?

2947
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,990
Can you imagine that with the Wi-Fi?

2948
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:41,330
What is that thing?

2949
01:49:41,930 --> 01:49:42,830
The Wi-Fi?

2950
01:49:43,090 --> 01:49:46,690
That would have taken a long time.

2951
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:49,030
Doki, aren't you on that thing?

2952
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:49,450
Oh no.

2953
01:49:50,630 --> 01:49:51,350
Wait, what?

2954
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:54,610
Is that Mario?

2955
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:55,250
Is that Mario?

2956
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:56,630
No, I went the wrong way.

2957
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:58,290
What does he do?

2958
01:49:58,690 --> 01:49:59,170
Nothing.

2959
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:01,750
Oh, before hitting the dice?

2960
01:50:02,130 --> 01:50:02,890
Wait, that's crazy.

2961
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:05,330
That's so annoying, I just went down.

2962
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,030
I'm gonna get him.

2963
01:50:12,530 --> 01:50:13,770
He's gonna be in my pocket.

2964
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:17,250
I don't like this, bro.

2965
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:18,290
There's two turns left.

2966
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:19,110
You should put it back.

2967
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:22,530
I'm putting it there.

2968
01:50:22,910 --> 01:50:23,850
Yeah, put it in the back.

2969
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:24,950
He's closer.

2970
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:31,710
Oh, you can't.

2971
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:32,870
You have to roll twice.

2972
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:36,490
Yeah, I gotta hope that I get two decent rolls for these next turns.

2973
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:38,470
That's decent, I guess.

2974
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:40,470
Yeah, you just need to get six or more.

2975
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:41,930
It's at the top.

2976
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:44,410
I will try!

2977
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:47,610
Just don't let Komi get it.

2978
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:49,290
Just don't let him get it.

2979
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:50,370
I need a six to get the star, yeah.

2980
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,900
Oh, that's a nice roll.

2981
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,140
Wait, do you have enough coins?

2982
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:01,400
You have enough coins too!

2983
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,800
You know what to do.

2984
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:05,780
Star, star.

2985
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,140
Steal a star.

2986
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,920
He stole a star from you, remember that.

2987
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:11,380
No, I didn't.

2988
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,920
He stole a star from you, remember that.

2989
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:18,740
He stole a star from you, remember that.

2990
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:19,440
You will lose!

2991
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,340
Do you understand that?

2992
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:25,160
She doesn't care about winning.

2993
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,180
She just wants me to lose.

2994
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:44,600
I got ways to fix this.

2995
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:47,700
Roast bacon on the star trap.

2996
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:50,160
He's voting for star traps.

2997
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,940
Oh my gosh.

2998
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,600
Bacon on the trap.

2999
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,840
It's the only way.

3000
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,620
It's the only way I'll ever get them back.

3001
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,960
Nobody's even going that way either because Wario's up top.

3002
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:03,600
But I have to try.

3003
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:07,380
I don't think I'm ever going to see anyone go down there ever again.

3004
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,460
Money, please.

3005
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:11,280
No one even wants the laps anymore.

3006
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,000
No one needs the coins.

3007
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:15,380
Everyone just wants to avoid the star.

3008
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,080
No item for you.

3009
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:19,080
That's some bullshit.

3010
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:19,640
You're on it.

3011
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:22,260
So therefore, I should steal your star.

3012
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,980
I go up, so wait a minute.

3013
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,600
I don't get another star.

3014
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:28,060
Oh, it depends.

3015
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:28,960
My turn!

3016
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:32,540
My turn to look at the fucking board.

3017
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,300
That would be the craziest 10 of your life.

3018
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,580
Where is the part where I lose the star?

3019
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:39,520
Oh, it's right here.

3020
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,400
It's directly in front of you.

3021
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,800
You might as well just triple dice it up.

3022
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,400
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

3023
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,480
I was going to triple dice it so no matter what, it won't get to me.

3024
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:54,320
Unless I get really fucked over by the rolls like right now.

3025
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,900
Oh, no!

3026
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:57,420
I will never get it!

3027
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:58,920
I never get it!

3028
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,420
Everyone, space away!

3029
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:03,640
That's what I got with my one roll.

3030
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:06,880
He's literally winning.

3031
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,040
He's in third right now.

3032
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,640
We hit random for you!

3033
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:13,920
I hit random for you!

3034
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,100
He has the potential to get a star.

3035
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:17,500
You have potential!

3036
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,620
You're literally next to the star!

3037
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,260
You're next to the star, Kony!

3038
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,500
He has zero chance.

3039
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:25,540
He's fighting because he knows I'm spitting.

3040
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:27,080
You're next to a star.

3041
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,700
He's fighting because he knows I'm spitting.

3042
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:31,880
He's the only person that can potentially get a star.

3043
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:33,800
Matt sold you out, Kony.

3044
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,320
Matt sold you out.

3045
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:37,020
That is insane.

3046
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,480
I'm not going to get a star!

3047
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:40,040
I think it's more than 10 away!

3048
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:44,780
That was a test?

3049
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:47,340
That's fine!

3050
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:48,640
That's fine!

3051
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:51,240
If I lose the star, I lost Kony's star.

3052
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,520
So that's okay with me.

3053
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,120
Okay, give us Kony.

3054
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:56,980
Bowser's going to give a star to Kony.

3055
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,840
He's going to say Kony.

3056
01:53:59,020 --> 01:53:59,720
He's probably going to say don't.

3057
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,460
Oh, that's fine!

3058
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:03,840
I don't need that.

3059
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,400
I have literally no chance to get the star.

3060
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,180
I don't know why we agreed to that.

3061
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,960
I don't know why we let Koji win here.

3062
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,300
I don't know why that was so funny that we had to do.

3063
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:14,440
But here we are.

3064
01:54:14,860 --> 01:54:15,260
Yay!

3065
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:17,460
What about a win?

3066
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:18,580
I don't like that.

3067
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:19,080
Yay!

3068
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,220
What about the bonus stars at the end?

3069
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,980
That's real, Mario.

3070
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:24,460
That's when Mario Party starts.

3071
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:27,380
All of this doesn't matter until minigames start.

3072
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:29,780
As long as Brawl Pro doesn't win the minigame star, he's fine.

3073
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:33,840
Guys, you've got to make sure Brawl Pro doesn't win the minigame star.

3074
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,340
Whoa, what is that?

3075
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,380
Whoa, what are you trying to say about that, Kony?

3076
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,760
Brawl Pro won more when he was NPC.

3077
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:45,260
Leave me alone!

3078
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:47,300
Leave me alone!

3079
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:47,580
Yo!

3080
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:50,440
Yo!

3081
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:51,980
Yo, malicious!

3082
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,220
We're on a team!

3083
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,920
We're on a team!

3084
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,760
A team fight!

3085
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,480
Guys, we're on a team!

3086
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:03,700
Guys, we're on a team!

3087
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:04,300
You know what?

3088
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:05,540
Here, hit me.

3089
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:06,140
Hit me.

3090
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:08,320
Go ahead.

3091
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,900
I'll take the money.

3092
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,760
I'm okay with this.

3093
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:15,360
You shared the money, right?

3094
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:22,420
I lost all my money.

3095
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:22,980
I'm dead.

3096
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:25,020
I have CTE.

3097
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,200
You're dead.

3098
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,480
I have CTE.

3099
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:29,980
Awesome, man.

3100
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:30,580
Great.

3101
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,000
So cool.

3102
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:35,560
Nice.

3103
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,680
I did it.

3104
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:40,100
I don't care if you lose points.

3105
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,240
You guys didn't even help me.

3106
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:46,080
What do you want me to do?

3107
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,260
How can we help you?

3108
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:49,120
Body block?

3109
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:51,560
Yeah, where's the defense?

3110
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:52,720
I thought you guys were a team.

3111
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:54,920
What happened?

3112
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,260
You guys didn't protect him.

3113
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:00,360
No change.

3114
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:02,000
Alright, bro.

3115
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:02,680
Watch this.

3116
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:04,260
Alright, the final turn.

3117
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:05,400
He's gonna get Wario.

3118
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:07,880
He's gonna get Wario, guys.

3119
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:10,580
He's been waiting for the rest of us.

3120
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,640
Oh, you know what to do with that creepy dice?

3121
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:14,920
Absolutely not.

3122
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,100
His ass is thinking.

3123
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:21,040
Anybody's gonna land that, right?

3124
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:21,860
On the last turn.

3125
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,360
I feel like there's so many traps now.

3126
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,840
It's funny that no one has landed on.

3127
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:26,860
I'm just gonna send it and hope.

3128
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,020
Oh my god, thank you.

3129
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:29,780
Oh, you got it.

3130
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,900
You got the extra star.

3131
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:32,240
Wait a minute.

3132
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:35,160
This plus bonus stars.

3133
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,180
That one's longer.

3134
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,380
The outside track is longer.

3135
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:42,920
So, theoretically...

3136
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,300
This is the last turn, though, Kony.

3137
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:46,540
Which is the exact reason she's still a star.

3138
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,380
Okay, alright.

3139
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:47,500
Alright.

3140
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,220
This is the last turn.

3141
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,580
That's too far.

3142
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:53,880
I think that's gotta be too far.

3143
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:57,680
A clean ending as well.

3144
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,460
Creepy bonus stars.

3145
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:04,440
If I get the most haunted star...

3146
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:05,500
Most haunted?

3147
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:06,780
Oh.

3148
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:10,100
Powerful.

3149
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:13,620
You have to go up.

3150
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:14,760
Down...

3151
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,700
Downstairs is like the death trap.

3152
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:19,920
It's over anyway, because it's the last turn.

3153
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,460
They're not even gonna give him an item.

3154
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:24,000
Oh, you can't even get an item?

3155
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:25,520
Alright, how far?

3156
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:26,440
Is it within 10?

3157
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,200
You gotta hit 10.

3158
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,820
This has to be the biggest character arc.

3159
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:33,760
If you can hit 10 right now...

3160
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:35,820
This determines whether or not you're a main character.

3161
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:37,520
Yeah, it just determines it.

3162
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:39,880
I did hit the 2 on my own trap.

3163
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,560
Pull right here.

3164
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,180
And do the overwatch ult.

3165
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:44,760
The anticipation.

3166
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:45,960
The build.

3167
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,960
Only for it to be taken away.

3168
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:49,640
Come on, what will it be?

3169
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:50,920
What will it be?

3170
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,260
I just need this.

3171
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,040
Hold.

3172
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:55,280
Hold.

3173
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:59,000
Abogado's your slew fish!

3174
01:57:59,360 --> 01:57:59,580
No!

3175
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:01,040
What?

3176
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:03,400
I win!

3177
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,600
I win!

3178
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:06,840
Why?

3179
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,260
Oh my god!

3180
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:12,600
Oh!

3181
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:14,740
Oh my god!

3182
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,820
I can't believe it!

3183
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:21,120
Not even the main character!

3184
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,640
He's literally an NPC in our game!

3185
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:24,900
He's an extra!

3186
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,040
Oh my god!

3187
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,920
I'm the boss!

3188
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,280
That everybody had to team up to beat!

3189
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:32,280
I'm LeDon!

3190
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:34,080
I'm LeDon!

3191
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:34,300
Oh my god!

3192
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,540
Mr. Mario Party himself.

3193
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,160
I'm gonna make it shine!

3194
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:41,120
Make my car shine!

3195
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:43,840
They had to have a whole festival on how to kill me!

3196
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,320
This is the guy that died in the first episode.

3197
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:48,400
Gary Misfits!

3198
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:51,460
Oh, look how shiny my car is.

3199
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,160
You guys like it?

3200
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:54,900
None of us got Wario.

3201
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:56,900
Yeah, I just made it shinier.

3202
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:57,460
That's it.

3203
01:58:57,500 --> 01:58:59,500
That was the only decision I had.

3204
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,200
I'm gonna kill everyone!

3205
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,780
I'll be free!

3206
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:03,740
Get over there!

3207
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,940
I don't wanna be on his team!

3208
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:07,940
You know what to do, Matt.

3209
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,460
You stole a star from me!

3210
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:11,440
We jumped the gun.

3211
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,180
I had to, bro.

3212
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:16,420
It's competitive.

3213
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:18,500
Yeah, he had to!

3214
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:19,860
What do I do?

3215
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:22,020
I make platformers.

3216
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:24,620
I'm good at platforming.

3217
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:28,400
Oh my god, why am I the platformer?

3218
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:29,160
Oh, this is bad.

3219
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:30,380
I'm good at platforming.

3220
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:31,000
You can go further.

3221
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:32,920
Oh, we can go next, actually.

3222
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,820
This is not good for me.

3223
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:36,860
This is not good.

3224
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,800
We can go next.

3225
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:40,100
We can just ready up and go next.

3226
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:41,520
I don't know.

3227
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:45,100
I don't know if Doki's gonna be performing on this one.

3228
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:47,020
I don't think I'm gonna be Doki.

3229
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:48,700
I don't think I'll be Doki.

3230
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,100
Alright, we gotta hit start right now.

3231
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,660
Okay, okay, this is fine.

3232
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:58,220
It might actually be faster for Doki if I hit all of the targets.

3233
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,720
Yeah, honestly, no, 100%.

3234
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,200
100% it works.

3235
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,020
No, these aren't hard.

3236
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:07,100
Okay, you gotta have a little bit of a gap.

3237
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:07,460
Okay.

3238
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:09,400
That's fine.

3239
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:18,640
Okay, believe in me.

3240
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:19,820
I can parkour.

3241
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:20,820
Believe, believe, believe.

3242
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:22,280
Okay.

3243
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,120
I believe in you.

3244
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:25,940
I literally don't.

3245
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:26,660
I literally don't.

3246
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:31,060
That is kind of like parkour civilization.

3247
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:32,920
Don't believe in me.

3248
02:00:35,180 --> 02:00:36,800
Not when it comes to parkour.

3249
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,400
That was all.

3250
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:39,460
We were almost there.

3251
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:41,440
I should have jumped for the chicken.

3252
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:43,420
I jumped.

3253
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,560
All he did was put the platforms down.

3254
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:46,680
Alright, now the game starts.

3255
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:49,020
Mini game time.

3256
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:51,020
Mini start bonus stars.

3257
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:52,880
The game starts now.

3258
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:53,840
Give me the slow poke.

3259
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,020
I need the slow poke.

3260
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,520
Look at my incredible start.

3261
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,200
Take it away.

3262
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:02,900
And see if you can spot where the steal is.

3263
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:06,180
A star for Boo.

3264
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:08,280
And then...

3265
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,180
Wow, interesting.

3266
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:11,800
Cool.

3267
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:16,940
Hey, great games, everybody.

3268
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:18,900
The mini game bonus.

3269
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:21,980
Obviously, that goes to Donkey Kong.

3270
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:24,660
There's nothing to complain about.

3271
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,900
You got the mini game.

3272
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:27,740
And then, it's the slow poke.

3273
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:30,360
Well, well, well.

3274
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:31,360
There's no way.

3275
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,300
There's no way.

3276
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:43,340
I've been the main character the whole time.

3277
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:46,400
I've been the main character the whole time.

3278
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,320
Sometimes the bad guy wins.

3279
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:54,640
Sometimes the bad guy wins.

3280
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,860
Hey, I'm the superstar.

3281
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,540
I told you you were in my arena.

3282
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:02,200
I can't believe he was the main character all along.

3283
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,560
I can't believe.

3284
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:06,300
That's tough.

3285
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,880
One via bonus stars.

3286
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:09,780
Hard carried.

3287
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,660
Carried by luck.

3288
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:15,640
That's tough.

3289
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:17,000
Hey, let's check the bonuses.

3290
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:18,360
Oh, boy, look at that.

3291
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,240
Hey, check the details, man.

3292
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:22,940
Damn, look at that.

3293
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:23,640
The misfortune.

3294
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,760
I was so unfortunate.

3295
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,140
Three reds, dude.

3296
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:28,200
Wait, Donkey got zero reds.

3297
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,380
I got zero reds.

3298
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,600
I've been the luckiest.

3299
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:33,340
I've been the luckiest.

3300
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:34,400
Five items.

3301
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:36,100
282...

3302
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:37,580
Dude, come on.

3303
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,520
I can't believe it.

3304
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,260
I can't believe he literally won.

3305
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:41,700
I don't care.

3306
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:42,840
Luck is not a clutch.

3307
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,720
It wouldn't have changed, but it got me the red spot.

3308
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:46,420
Hey, great work, everybody.

3309
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:48,100
I can't believe it, guys.

3310
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,360
That was fun, though.

3311
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,780
I won the real ego match because I outmatched Kony in a Mario Party game.

3312
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:56,920
Oh, that's true.

3313
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:04,880
He was bragging about his button mashing just for him to get outmashed by Matt.

3314
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,820
That's so true.

3315
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:08,700
Outmash in a Mario Party game is...

3316
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:11,620
You were on a Joy-Con, which is a little different.

3317
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:12,360
Oh!

3318
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:17,500
Now you're bringing up the rolling?

3319
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,160
I just got so many achievements.

3320
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:21,160
Me too.

3321
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:21,940
I got like five.

3322
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:23,800
Oh my god, there's Battle Pass.

3323
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:24,220
Let's go.

3324
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,620
I forgot Battle Pass.

3325
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,580
Oh, is it mine?

3326
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:30,600
Oh, they added Pro Role.

3327
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:32,380
Oh, party points.

3328
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,160
What does that mean?

3329
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:35,700
Great game.

3330
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:36,640
That was fantastic.

3331
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,020
GG's everybody.

3332
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:39,320
That was fun.

3333
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:40,980
I had a lot of fun.

3334
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,540
Yeah, you won.

3335
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:43,600
Of course you had fun.

3336
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,320
I had so much fun.

3337
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:47,420
You guys want to do this again?

3338
02:03:47,940 --> 02:03:48,620
There are more maps.

3339
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,660
Alright, fuck it.

3340
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,580
Let's get back together soon.

3341
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,480
Actually, I'm playing...

3342
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,680
So on Friday, I'm playing with some other friends, but we can play after.

3343
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:58,620
I'll do two games.

3344
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,220
Sure.

3345
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:02,420
I mean, I'm always not busy.

3346
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:05,320
Alright, I'll be here.

3347
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,580
Wait, can we get like slime in?

3348
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:08,160
With the eight party?

3349
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:10,840
There's an eight player.

3350
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,500
But does that mean we can just make it five instead of eight?

3351
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:15,700
Or does it have to be eight?

3352
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:17,960
I don't know, actually.

3353
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,460
We'll figure it out, but I'm doing it Saturday at like four.

3354
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,820
So I think I'll play later, but we'll see.

3355
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:25,100
Alright, we'll see.

3356
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:26,960
Alright, sounds good.

3357
02:04:28,780 --> 02:04:31,100
Shoot them to me, because I got a bounty.

3358
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:32,180
Brawl Pro.

3359
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:34,900
Wait, what's the bounty?

3360
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,000
It's for...

3361
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:39,700
Tribe 9.

3362
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:43,300
Tribe 9, the hot new game for the Danganronpa devs, I guess.

3363
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:46,300
Oh, the Danganronpa devs?

3364
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,820
Looks so cool.

3365
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:48,940
Can't wait to try it.

3366
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:53,180
Wait, can I get the bounty right now if I log on to Twitch?

3367
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:53,780
Yes, probably.

3368
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:55,700
I can't.

3369
02:04:56,060 --> 02:04:57,480
They don't give me bounties.

3370
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:58,540
Bro, I asked.

3371
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,280
I tried.

3372
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,100
They keep telling me no.

3373
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,820
I'm not big enough.

3374
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:06,340
I should've streamed today.

3375
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:07,480
I could've hit those bounties.

3376
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,340
Yeah, you could've had those bounties.

3377
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:10,500
Bounties are W's, bro.

3378
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:12,580
Yeah, you get paid for those.

3379
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:15,480
They don't give them to me, man.

3380
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:16,720
They don't like me.

3381
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:20,900
You gotta be a variety streamer, Brawl Pro, that you like the variety more.

3382
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,500
I don't know why it's very exclusive.

3383
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:25,300
Alright, we play Saturday, maybe.

3384
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:26,040
I'll hit you guys up.

3385
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:28,000
GG's!

3386
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,620
Thanks for joining the collab!

3387
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:32,000
Bye, everybody!

3388
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:33,080
Bye-bye!

3389
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:37,100
Oh my god, that was so fun!

3390
02:05:37,220 --> 02:05:40,680
I'm glad that we had our little team Brawl Pro reunion.

3391
02:05:41,180 --> 02:05:47,520
I can't believe fucking Kony won the misfortune award after everything we've done.

3392
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,440
The bonus star was misfortune.

3393
02:05:49,580 --> 02:05:51,660
That's actually so fucking...

3394
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:54,960
Oh my god, what is this main character energy right there?

3395
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:56,900
Like, what the fuck was that?

3396
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,400
I can't believe it.

3397
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:01,220
It was so rigged.

3398
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:03,120
Not last up.

3399
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:04,100
Not last.

3400
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,360
That's all that matters.

3401
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,920
That's just Mario Party.

3402
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:10,080
I didn't get last place.

3403
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:11,360
Let's fucking go.

3404
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:18,940
Oh my god, I'm trying not to laugh too much because I start coughing more when I laugh too much.

3405
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,160
So I'm trying not to.

3406
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,000
Um...

3407
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,540
But yeah, I'm still coughing, guys.

3408
02:06:24,740 --> 02:06:28,660
It doesn't really matter if I don't stream because I just...

3409
02:06:28,660 --> 02:06:31,580
The coughing is just a thing that's been going...

3410
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:36,020
I get it yearly, so like every year I get it once.

3411
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:41,620
And then after, it's just basically like, I just can't stop coughing for a while.

3412
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:43,840
Um...

3413
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:47,260
So, yeah, it's just my seasonal coughing allergy.

3414
02:06:49,580 --> 02:06:51,520
So, it's alright, guys.

3415
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,100
It's just gonna take a while to get better.

3416
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:55,220
Because it always happens.

3417
02:06:55,460 --> 02:07:00,240
Even when I wasn't a streamer, when I wasn't a streamer, it's been like that as well.

3418
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:01,920
So, yeah, the lingering cough.

3419
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:09,280
Even when I wasn't a streamer, and I don't even stream or talk, my cough would last for weeks and stuff.

3420
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:12,000
I just had to power through it.

3421
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:17,360
But it sucks because it's so hard to laugh because when I laugh, it triggers a coughing fit.

3422
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:21,280
So, I have to make sure I can't laugh too much, which is very difficult.

3423
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,220
A lolly!

3424
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:23,080
Thank you for the super chat!

3425
02:07:23,180 --> 02:07:24,040
Thank you, thank you!

3426
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:28,740
That last mini game gave me a flashback to a certain Mega Man-inspired fan game.

3427
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:30,100
Ba-dum, ba-dum.

3428
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:32,180
Was great to see the gang back together.

3429
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:32,980
Thank you for the super chat!

3430
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:33,600
Thank you, thank you!

3431
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:34,040
Yeah!

3432
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:35,100
I'm so happy!

3433
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:37,800
I'm so happy I was able to organize this reunion.

3434
02:07:38,120 --> 02:07:45,700
I'm glad that, like, Cody and I have been talking, joking about being like, oh yeah, let's bring back the bring back Team Brawl Pro for a Mario party.

3435
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:46,680
It's gonna be so fun!

3436
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:48,160
And I'm glad we were able to do it.

3437
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:50,740
Yeah, Darkblade, thank you for the super chat!

3438
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:51,540
Thank you, thank you!

3439
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:52,800
It needs eight players.

3440
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:55,760
Maybe try and get Bryanco and SK for a full reunion.

3441
02:07:55,880 --> 02:07:56,640
Thank you for the super chat!

3442
02:07:56,780 --> 02:07:57,640
Thank you, thank you!

3443
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,420
Can it be, like...

3444
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:02,800
The thing is, like, eight players is a lot of people in the fucking call.

3445
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:04,480
Um...

3446
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,400
So I'm thinking, like, um...

3447
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:09,380
Could we have, like, five players and then three bots?

3448
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:10,520
Like, is that possible?

3449
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:14,400
I think, like, eight players might be just too many people in the call together.

3450
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:15,860
So I'm not sure about that.

3451
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:24,430
I think it'd be more fun if it was, like, four to five and three CPUs.

3452
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:27,190
Um... But yeah, we'll see how it goes.

3453
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:30,830
We'll see what, uh, Cody's gonna do because Cody's the one that's gonna organize the next one.

3454
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:32,650
Um, but yeah, it's so much fun!

3455
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:38,270
I'm really happy we're able to bring the boys back together to play Mario Party.

3456
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:41,050
Bro, they are all, like, fucking Nintendo nerds!

3457
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:42,150
They knew everything!

3458
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:46,690
They knew everything about the fucking Mario Party!

3459
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:49,250
And I'm just like, guys, please, let me read, guys.

3460
02:08:49,930 --> 02:08:55,070
Guys, please, I just let me, let me read just a little bit!

3461
02:08:55,230 --> 02:08:56,690
Just, oh, just let me...

3462
02:08:59,330 --> 02:09:02,710

02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:06,590

02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:07,430

02:09:08,910 --> 02:09:09,350
Hahaha!

3466
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:12,590
Anyway, guys, um...

3467
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:15,210
Um...

3468
02:09:15,210 --> 02:09:17,690
Uh, thank you everybody for coming.

3469
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:19,470
I'm gonna go rest my voice now.

3470
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:20,870
As always, everybody, say hi.

3471
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:22,810
Oh yeah, by the way, I talked about this with the members.

3472
02:09:23,190 --> 02:09:25,530
Uh, tomorrow, I said yes to a sponsor stream.

3473
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:27,370
Um, so we have three streams tomorrow.

3474
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:30,410
Well, two streams and then one off-stream thing.

3475
02:09:30,490 --> 02:09:31,250
One off-stream collab.

3476
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:34,030
Um, so, we're starting at 12.

3477
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:41,750
Um, we're, by the way, um, the reason why it's so last minute was that, this is for the Ascendant, by the way.

3478
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:49,430
Remember when, like, we got the Ascendant playtest and we were like, we were like, hey, wouldn't it be funny if they sponsored me?

3479
02:09:49,550 --> 02:09:50,170
Hehehe, haha.

3480
02:09:51,710 --> 02:09:54,330
And then we tried to peer pressure the devs to sponsor me.

3481
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:59,950
So, like, today, they were like, if you can do the sponsor stream tomorrow, we'll sponsor you.

3482
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:02,590
And then I was like, if you pay me right now, I'll do it.

3483
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:03,850
And then they paid me right now.

3484
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:05,410
So, that's why we're...

3485
02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:05,970
hahaha.

3486
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:08,450
We did it, guys!

3487
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:09,370
We got him!

3488
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:13,530
So, that's why the, um, that's why we're doing it tomorrow.

3489
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:15,610
Cause I was like, if you pay me right now, I'll do it.

3490
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:17,550
And then, cause, like, everybody has a price.

3491
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:19,870
And, like, you know, I had a price.

3492
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:21,330
They gave me that price.

3493
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:23,030
They sent that money in.

3494
02:10:23,110 --> 02:10:24,510
And I was like, alright, I'm ready.

3495
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:25,450
Hahaha.

3496
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:32,850
So, tomorrow we're having a, um, the Ascendant, uh, the Ascendant, uh, sponsor tomorrow at 12.

3497
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:37,550
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3498
02:10:37,710 --> 02:10:40,570
And if you say that for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

3499
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:41,910
