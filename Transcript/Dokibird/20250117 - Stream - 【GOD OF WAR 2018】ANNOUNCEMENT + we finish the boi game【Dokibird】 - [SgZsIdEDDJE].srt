1
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,250
Hello, hello everybody.

2
00:01:51,630 --> 00:02:03,010
Hello, I am, I am dead inside because it's 12.30 and at 12.30 I...

3
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:14,770
I am, I am extra dead inside at 12.30.

4
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,690
I know I had sent messages earlier, but after I was like angry messages, angry rant.

5
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:31,050
And then I angry ranted myself tired and I was like, sleep time, sleep time.

6
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,030
And I woke up, I'm like, oh, why did I do sleep time?

7
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,130
I could have just, oh, I could have just stayed up.

8
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,530
Why did I do sleep time?

9
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,590
Oh, yeah.

10
00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:00,510
Okay, guys, sorry, I need to wake up a little bit more before we do the special, the special announcement.

11
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,490
Sorry, let me answer this work messages.

12
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,120
Sorry, I can't even talk while I send messages anymore.

13
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,440
I can't multi-task.

14
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,940
Okay, sorry, I can't multi-task while I'm dead inside.

15
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,440
Okay, I need to be more awake to talk about this announcement.

16
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,080
So give me a sec as my brain revs up.

17
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,780
It was like...

18
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,760
And it's like, turn the key on and you're like...

19
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,700
I can't even make a read.

20
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,260
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Oh, why did I?

22
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,460
Why do I always do nap time?

23
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,980
Nap time is always a mistake, guys.

24
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,800
Oh, my God.

25
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,420
I should never do nap time.

26
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,500
I had to fix my chat.

27
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,580
Give me a second to blow my nose, too.

28
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,630
I'm so...

29
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,050
Okay.

30
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,650
I am okay.

31
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,870
I will be okay, guys.

32
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,010
I will be okay for dad and boy.

33
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,990
I'll be okay for boy.

34
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,390
Okay.

35
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,730
All right.

36
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,410
Okay, before I do an announcement, I need to download the announcement.

37
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,740
Okay.

38
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,600
I thought I was going to be sent the images, but I think they...

39
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,920
I think, like, it's not...

40
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,660
It's okay.

41
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,920
I can use these images.

42
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,980
I'm pretty sure.

43
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah, I'll be fine.

44
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,200
All right.

45
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
It's going to be fine.

46
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,260
It might...

47
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,600
Okay.

48
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,720
All right.

49
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,340
Oh, shit.

50
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,000
It's the replay.

51
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,820
Oh, that's how tired I am.

52
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
Thank you for letting me know that the replay is on.

53
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,280
All right.

54
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,520
All right.

55
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,420
Okay.

56
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
I also need to make a tweet after.

57
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,780
I was supposed to draft a tweet before the stream.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,000
Before...

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,740
Like, after I make the announcement, I'd be like, post tweet.

60
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,660
But I woke up late today.

61
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,180
So...

62
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,760
I'm so sorry.

63
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,540
But we'll do it all live.

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,660
We'll do...

65
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,900
Look, a lot of stuff happened today.

66
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:16,840
So, obviously, those who were in the pre-chat would know, like, how I was very preoccupied with other things.

67
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,860
No.

68
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,740
No.

69
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,060
I'm tired.

70
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,540
Okay.

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,080
So, yeah.

72
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,540
Today started out very messy.

73
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,020
It's still a little messy.

74
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,780
So, like...

75
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,600
So, like, there's still some, like, aftermath messes from it.

76
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,740
So, I'm still a little mentally tired.

77
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,640
But I won't...

78
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,720
I'm trying to move on.

79
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,300
I don't want to talk about it.

80
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,840
It's just...

81
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,560
It's just related to, like, the Twitch rival shit.

82
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,680
But, like, it's all right.

83
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,640
We're fixing it.

84
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,880
Like, I mean, there's really nothing to fix.

85
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,880
I just got to, like, toughen it out and just be like, you're popular now.

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,600
You're popular now.

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
You've made a name for yourself on Twitch.

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Like, you just got to deal with it.

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,860
But it's just like...

90
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,820
It's just like, you know, stepping out of my bubble and then getting COVID.

91
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,480
That's...

92
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,420
That's how it feels like.

93
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:24,940
Yeah.

94
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,040
I felt so safe in my little YouTube bubble.

95
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,100
And then I stepped out and then COVID.

96
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,420
Yeah.

97
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,260
So, anyway.

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't want to talk about it, but it's just...

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,620
It's just related to Twitch rivals.

100
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,480
But, like, things are okay.

101
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,380
Nothing's going to be changing about my team.

102
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,500
But I had to deal with a lot of shit earlier today regarding my team.

103
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,140
But, like, I just felt like I can't...

104
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,340
Like, I'm just not going to let it affect me that much.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,080
Anyway.

106
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,340
Anyway.

107
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
Special announcements.

108
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,700
Well, one announcement.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
I guess you can make it two separate announcements.

110
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,200
Anyway, drum roll.

111
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,220
It's a very important announcement.

112
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,980
We're starting off with an announcement, too.

113
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,080
But, sorry.

114
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,360
Like, I'm, like, interjecting between drum rolls.

115
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,360
So, the very special...

116
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,400
Special, special, special, special announcement that I am making today.

117
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,220
As I prolong this special announcement in anticipation and in suspense.

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,120
To make you guys think, what could it be?

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,640
What could this special announcement be?

120
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,420
That she couldn't, like...

121
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,960
That she had to make a...

122
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,480
I also, like, I didn't put announcement on the title.

123
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,280
And then my manager was like, Doki, you forgot to put announcement.

124
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,380
And I was like, oh, fuck.

125
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,040
I was so tired because I was dealing with other stuff.

126
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I was like, oh, shit.

127
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,780
That's why I was like, oh, please, guys.

128
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Remember there was an announcement today.

129
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,460
Remembered it.

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,480
Guys, I know I forgot to tweet it.

131
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
The announcement part.

132
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,840
It's very...

133
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,460
It's actually...

134
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,820
It's actually very, very special.

135
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,960
I was just being a little silly.

136
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,040
I forgot to, like, include it in the title.

137
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,420
But it's there now.

138
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,560
So I was just being...

139
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,700
I was just being a little silly.

140
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Anyway, so...

141
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, wait, is that copyright?

142
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,480
I forgot what song that's from.

143
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,500
It's whatever.

144
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,220
What is this, you might ask?

145
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Well, Curious Dragoon.

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:08,220
I will be officially in as a cosmetic item on the Bandai Sinuality Echo of Ada.

147
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,560
Yes!

148
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,480
So, on the 24th, I will be officially in as a cosmetic item on the Bandai Sinuality Echo of Ada.

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I will be doing a special launch stream of the game.

150
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,040
And by checking out the 24th stream...

151
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,020
So you can see there's the back side.

152
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,320
It says Doki Bird.

153
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,120
This is a huge shout-out to Bandai for the sponsor and for including me as a cosmetic item.

154
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,120
And there's dad over here on the side.

155
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,820
And then there's...

156
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,700
Wait, that's the same image I just showed you guys.

157
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,060
And then there's the dragoon over here.

158
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah, they have a little dragoon right over here.

159
00:10:50,380 --> 00:11:06,440
So basically, if you tune in on the January 24th stream, I will be streaming Sinuality Echo of Ada on launch.

160
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,440
I'll also be on the official Bandai YouTube and Twitch channel.

161
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:20,580
Yes, for the very first time, I shall be multi-streaming on the official Bandai channels.

162
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,820
Plus my own... I don't know if I can... Can I do it on YouTube?

163
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,300
I don't know.

164
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,220
I'll figure it out.

165
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,180
But I'll definitely be on the Bandai Twitch channel.

166
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,280
Because I know you can do YouTube and Twitch.

167
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,660
But I don't know if you can do two YouTube channels.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,840
But I will definitely be on the Bandai official Twitch channel.

169
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,100
And I believe the stream will also be on the official Steam page.

170
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,860
Showcasing the launch of Sinuality Echo of Ada.

171
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,500
So all those Sinuality streams have actually led to this very moment.

172
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,700
Huge shoutout to Bandai.

173
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,980
I'm going to be an official cosmetic item in the game.

174
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,440
That's actually crazy to think about.

175
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,940
Especially a Bandai game.

176
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Like, oh my god.

177
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,680
So you'll be able... I'll be giving out a code.

178
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,220
That you will be able to access to claim the cosmetic.

179
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,180
So you have to tune in on the stream on the 24th.

180
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,460
If you want to claim... If you want a Doki Bird cosmetic.

181
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,560
Of this exact shirt.

182
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,760
So it's... Of course it's an official shirt.

183
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,900
So it is a code.

184
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,600
So you have to be able to claim it.

185
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,180
And oh yeah, it's actually crazy.

186
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,340
It's all thanks to Sandman.

187
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,100
It's all because I decided to play Sandman.

188
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,180
Sorry, Sandland.

189
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,120
It's all because I decided to play...

190
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,040
Sandland.

191
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,880
And it led to this moment.

192
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,760
But yes.

193
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,640
I've known about this for a long time.

194
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:09,500
And it's honestly been so difficult to keep this a secret from you guys.

195
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,600
Because I've known about it since I was basically sponsored by Bandai to do the Senuality streams.

196
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,380
So it's really great to finally be able to announce it.

197
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,960
And like, you know, it's crazy being officially in a Bandai game of all games.

198
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,940
Our very first experience was being in Rust.

199
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,900
And now we're in a Bandai game.

200
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,920
I'm like, wow.

201
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,880
I mean, it's fucking Bandai.

202
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
It's a pretty big deal.

203
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,520
I'm gonna say.

204
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,560
The Aquanium paid off.

205
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,820
Jonatas, thank you for the superchat.

206
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,960
Thank you, thank you.

207
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,320
Yeah, so that was my big announcement.

208
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,320
I'm super excited.

209
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,000
Like I said, please tune in on the stream on the 24th if you wish to claim the skin.

210
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,420
And I cannot wait to stream the launch date.

211
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,840
I cannot wait to create my waifu again.

212
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,400
Guys, create the same one.

213
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,900
How many times do I have to create the same woman?

214
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,720
Be like, please select another character.

215
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,640
I was like, no.

216
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,800
I know real when I recognize real.

217
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,720
What is this?

218
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,060
Okay, so it is big announced.

219
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,740
Okay, let me make it a pin.

220
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:58,540
On January 24th, I will be streaming Sin Duality, the launch of Sin Duality Echo of Ada.

221
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:11,780
And we'll be giving out the code for the official cosmetic Doki Bird item.

222
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,120
Thank you, Bandai.

223
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,140
There we go.

224
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,580
Alright.

225
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,260
There we go.

226
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,980
That's... yeah!

227
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh my gosh, I'm trying to sound more hyped.

228
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,380
But like, I'm so dead inside because of the lack of sleep.

229
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,360
But actually, that's a lie.

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,200
I slept a lot.

231
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,860
But like, I'm just mentally tired from this morning.

232
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,840
But yeah!

233
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,760
It's a really cool opportunity.

234
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,040
But like, I'm dead inside from other things.

235
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,140
It's gonna be a long day.

236
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,660
Don't worry.

237
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,740
I have my gamer subs here.

238
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,840
I definitely need it because it's gonna be a long fucking day today.

239
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm planning on... so yes.

240
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,800
I know it's a... I'm planning on finishing God of War today.

241
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,920
I looked up God of War 2018 playthrough.

242
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,960
No commentary.

243
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,960
Just to see like, how many hours I have.

244
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,180
This is how I decide if I'm doing like, the final playthrough of something.

245
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,860
I look at it and be like, how much do I have left?

246
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,080
Apparently, it's around 6-ish hours.

247
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,620
Depending on just how... I don't know.

248
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,180
Depending on like, if I can make it.

249
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,380
Like...

250
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,120
It looked like 6 hours.

251
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,660
So like, I think it's possible.

252
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,460
I think it's possible.

253
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,460
Every time.

254
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,720
Every time.

255
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,860
I always do that to figure out...

256
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,000
To figure out like, how much I have.

257
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,800
I figure out when it's the final part.

258
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,220
So I need... because like, you know.

259
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,040
I don't want to clickbait people and be like, this...

260
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,800
Like, I don't want to be like, do a stream and then suddenly that was the last part of the stream.

261
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,140
But nobody knew about it.

262
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,340
I like to be very vocal on the fact that...

263
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,040
This is the last part, guys!

264
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,120
This is it!

265
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,060
Alright.

266
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,700
Alright, we're doing it live.

267
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,720
We're drafting the tweet right now.

268
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,140
Okay, let me grab...

269
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,820
This...

270
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,500
Let me grab a template of my sponsor stuff.

271
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Alright, there we go.

272
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,280
Alright.

273
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,520
Okay.

274
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,620
We're gonna...

275
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,300
We're doing it all live!

276
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,140
I love doing stuff live.

277
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,540
Okay.

278
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,640
Do I have like, links for it?

279
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,500
Okay.

280
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,640
No, I don't.

281
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:39,960
Okay.

282
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,440
Alright.

283
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,640
I just have to be sure I have...

284
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,640
I have like, the link for...

285
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,060
For it and stuff.

286
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,840
But like, for any like, you know, PR link.

287
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,580
Okay, Senuality PR.

288
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,520
And then...

289
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,620
Most likely it'll be 5 PM.

290
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:01,680
5 PM.

291
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,680
Like, I'm deciding it all live.

292
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,740
Alright, this is how it...

293
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,620
Thank you, at Bandai, for...

294
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,980
Okay, how do I do this?

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,640
Okay, cause technically I am...

You can claim my shirt...

308
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,040
My cosmetic on during the stream.

309
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,100
Alright.

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,120

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,980
Oh my gosh, I still have words that I need to delete because it's too long.

During the stream.

319
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,700
During the stream.

320
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,120
Oh my god, it's too long!

321
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,480
It's too long!

322
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,760
The words are too...

323
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,240
Oh wait, I can...

324
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,680

Uh...

326
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,740
Oh my gosh, sorry.

327
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,800
I need to like figure out how to make this shorter.

328
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,520
Yeah, but...

329
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,480
When you're...

330
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,160

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
I want to make it short so it doesn't do like...

332
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,420
Continue more reading.

Like that shit.

335
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,380
I'm trying to avoid that.

336
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,780
Alright.

337
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,200
Let me put this image in.

338
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,120

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,440
I will be in a Bandai Namco game on January 24th.

How many more letters do I have to delete?!

352
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,660
Sorry, I'm...

353
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,220

I'm going through stuff right now.

356
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,720
It's okay, I'm okay.

357
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,440
I'm perfectly fine.

358
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,840
Okay.

359
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,580
I can delete the time.

360
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,020
You guys don't need to know the time.

361
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,520
At 5pm PST.

362
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,580
Alright.

363
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,900
Alright, there you go.

364
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,180
Alright, here we go.

365
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm making the tweet, guys.

366
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,700
But...

367
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,860
Okay, let's see.

368
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,060
Uh...

369
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,080
I'm making sure everything looks correct, guys.

370
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,620
I'm just making sure everything looks...

371
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,320
Alright, there you go.

372
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,260
Alright.

373
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,060
Alright, there you go.

374
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,080
Boop.

375
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,680
Wait.

376
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,840
And we'll be streaming on...

377
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,600
I'll be streaming on the Bandai Twitch and YouTube channel.

378
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,140
Plus my own channel.

379
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,640
Plus my own for the...

380
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,900
Okay, plus my own for the...

381
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,200
Alright!

382
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,300
Live!

383
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,840
Um, this is how...

384
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,080
This is how sponsorships goes, by the way.

385
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm giving you guys, like, a sneak peek of how the sponsorship stuff works.

386
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,220
Like, this is...

387
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,920
That's how real I am, guys.

388
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,600
That's...

389
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,520
That's...

390
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,800
This is what goes in my mind when I have to...

391
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,000
You get to look at, like, the behind the scenes of me fucking...

392
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,360
Trying to figure out how to tweet things.

393
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,740
That's a good girl.

394
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,460
Alright.

395
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,620
Okay.

396
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,120
On January 24th, I'll be streaming on the Bandai Twitch and YouTube channel.

397
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,220
Plus my own for the launch of Senuality.

398
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,300
Plus my...

399
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,700
Uh...

400
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,740
And my...

401
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,660
And my...

402
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,500
Okay, plus my own for the launch of...

403
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,080
Cleaning my cosmetic during the stream at 5pm PST.

404
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,800
Yay, okay.

405
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,180
Uh...

406
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,860
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

407
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,800
Okay, there you go.

408
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,540
Bam!

409
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,560
There we go.

410
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,740
We did it, guys.

411
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,620
We...

412
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,000
Alright, guys.

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,180
Gas this up.

414
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Woo!

415
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,170
We fucking did it!

416
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,310
Alright, here we go.

417
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,310
We did it live.

418
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,550
Alright.

419
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,950
And I did hashtag PR.

420
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,090
So I don't get in trouble with the legal system.

421
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,070
Professional.

422
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,270
You always have to tell...

423
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,050
Let people know.

424
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,410
It's...

425
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,210
It's a fucking...

426
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:12,550
Uh...

427
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,830
You gotta let people know.

428
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,890
It's sponsored.

429
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:18,970
Yeah.

430
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,470
We're doing our part.

431
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,730
Now, gas that tweet up.

432
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,310
So people know I did my job.

433
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,350
But yeah, it's a pretty exciting announcement.

434
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,590
It is definitely a very exciting announcement to be officially...

435
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,010
Part of...

436
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,730
Part of...

437
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,790
A Bandai game.

438
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,910
Even if it's just a cosmetic.

439
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,290
Because, you know, they literally programmed...

440
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,070
They programmed myself into the game.

441
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,170
So...

442
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,190
I'm so happy.

443
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,590
And it's actually...

444
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,290
And it all...

445
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,690
Like...

446
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,290
Like Sand Land basically led to this.

447
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,530
Which is...

448
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,550
Crazy to think about.

449
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,330
Like, the fact that...

450
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,490
Me playing Sand Land...

451
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,150
Like, put myself in...

452
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,610
Bandai's eyes.

453
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,610
Because, like, I was like the top...

454
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,370
I think I was like...

455
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,810
I think, like, what was it?

456
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,770
There was another game that launched around Sand Land's time.

457
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,670
And because of that, like...

458
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,610
I think, like...

459
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,910
I was like...

460
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,730
One of the streamers that...

461
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,610
Actually streamed...

462
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,790
One of the streamers that was super excited about Sand Land.

463
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,290
Because there was another game that launched at the same time.

464
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,530
So, I really appreciate that Bandai, like...

465
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,730
Saw my streams.

466
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,010
And watched my streams.

467
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,250
And were in my chat and stuff.

468
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,150
Like, engaging with my streams too.

469
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,870
And it really means a lot.

470
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,570
And through Sand Land...

471
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,730
They reached out to me and wanted to sponsor me.

472
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,170
And put me in one of their newer games.

473
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,150
One of the other games that was coming out.

474
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,450
Which was Senuality.

475
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,470
So, a huge thank you to Bandai.

476
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,730
And the team in Senuality.

477
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:01,590
For...

478
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,730
Putting me in their game.

479
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,450
And I really appreciate it.

480
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:06,950
So, yeah.

481
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,590
You can get your very own shirt.

482
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,490
You can get your...

483
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,270
I better see...

484
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,770
When I play Senuality on the 24th.

485
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,370
I better see you guys fucking wearing my shirt.

486
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,350
Guys, I better see you like...

487
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,210
And I'll still kill you.

488
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,270
But like...

489
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,010
I'm still gonna take your legs.

490
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,950
But like...

491
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,790
At least I know they're your legs.

492
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,190
You know?

493
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,050
At least I know they're Dragoon's legs.

494
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:26,930
But...

495
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,990
So, like...

496
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,670
It's good to know that you're a Dragoon.

497
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,210
No, no.

498
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,690
You can...

499
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,570
You'll unlock it instantly.

500
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,750
Cause it'll be a code...

501
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,870
That'll be giving out during the stream.

502
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,790
So, like...

503
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,790
Anybody can use the code.

504
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:43,850
But...

505
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,830
The code will be giving out...

506
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,870
On the 24th.

507
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,730
So, anybody can claim the code.

508
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,370
So, you don't have to grind the game out or anything.

509
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,070
You just instantly get it.

510
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,210
Alright!

511
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,730
Alright, let me boot up...

512
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,610
God of War.

513
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,610
So, the last time we left God of War...

514
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,870
Oh, let me plug in my controller.

515
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,170
Wait, no.

516
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,470
I already have my controller plugged in.

517
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,490
Let me swap it to a Playstation controller.

518
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,830
Cause last time we used an Xbox controller.

519
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,870
Oh my gosh, I am slowly waking up now.

520
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,730
I'm actually waking up right now.

521
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,110
Oh my god.

522
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,950
It's gonna be a long fucking day today.

523
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,470
Is this supposed to be...

524
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,290
Is that supposed to be the sound?

525
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,670
Oh no.

526
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,590
Is that...

527
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,250
I don't know.

528
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,530
I'm trying to remember if this was the...

529
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,690
That has to be the Dynasty.

530
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,970
I didn't adjust it yet.

531
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,910
I gotta make sure this is the Dynasty Warrior sound settings.

532
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,550
So, like, I don't have to forget.

533
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:46,830
Okay.

534
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:47,790
Dynasty.

535
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,770
I always keep note of the sound settings I have for each game.

536
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:52,550
If it's a series.

537
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,730
So, I'm gonna change that to Dynasty.

538
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,190
And then...

539
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,970
God of War was 10.08.

540
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,490
Okay.

541
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,970
10.08.

542
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,350
Professional streamer here.

543
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,230
That's how I keep track of the sound.

544
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,090
Like, what the sound is.

545
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,050
No, there's no second announcement.

546
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,270
There's no, like, story update today.

547
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,510
I mean, if you were in pre-chat, you basically got a story update.

548
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,510
But it was an angry story update.

549
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,890
But, like, it's okay.

550
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,450
I'm just tired now.

551
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,650
Alright.

552
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,490
Oh, yes.

553
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,490
It's actually...

554
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,270
It's always been God of War.

555
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,570
It's always been God of War.

556
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:44,770
It's okay.

557
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,390
The price of going outside...

558
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,730
The price of getting COVID.

559
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,630
Oh my god.

560
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,490
Now I understand, like, why people get into so much drama.

561
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,550
I was like, how do people...

562
00:27:59,550 --> 00:27:59,930
I was just...

563
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,530
I didn't even...

564
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,890
I was just like...

565
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,690
I was like...

566
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,230
What the...

567
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,490
I feel like...

568
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,290
I feel like Twitch always gets into a lot of drama.

569
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,810
And now I understand.

570
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,730
Like, I just...

571
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,850
Like, I put myself out there for, like, two weeks.

572
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,270
And then, suddenly, I'm part of drama.

573
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,570
And I didn't even realize it.

574
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,690
Like...

575
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,290
Like...

576
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,170
There's, like, apparently, like, several Twitch dramas going on right now.

577
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,430
And, like...

578
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,790
Like, the fucking...

579
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,010
What was it?

580
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,630
There's the Pirate Software one.

581
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,130
There's Elon Musk versus Asmongold.

582
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,430
There's, like, two other things that happened.

583
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,470
I, like, didn't realize the whole, like...

584
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,490
I don't pay attention to World of Warcraft.

585
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,070
Especially hardcore World of Warcraft.

586
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,910
So, like...

587
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,150
Like, I didn't know what the fuck was going on until it was on my entire Twitter feed.

588
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,810
And I saw, like...

589
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,050
Your people were like...

590
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,070
Jokey, what do you think?

591
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,830
And I was like...

592
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,650
I don't care.

593
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:01,470
Like...

594
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,430
I'm sorry.

595
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,290
It's not in my jurisdiction.

596
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,950
I legitimately...

597
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,190
I, like, don't care about...

598
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,230
Like, I'm sorry.

599
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,150
I legit...

600
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,230
I, like...

601
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,970
I...

602
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,190
Okay.

603
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,050
Story...

604
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,410
Okay, this is my story time for...

605
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,370
Like...

606
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,070
If it's not...

607
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,410
If it's something that I don't know much about or, like, something I actually...

608
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:24,790
I don't care.

609
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,870
Like, it's not in my field.

610
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:31,910
Okay.

611
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,030
Here's why I don't care about World of Warcraft.

612
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,570
Let me...

613
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,770
Okay, here's my story time.

614
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,470
This is why...

615
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,810
I actually received an email.

616
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,270
Okay, Dragunov, you're here.

617
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,190
I did...

618
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,230
I thought it was funny.

619
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,210
But, like...

620
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,770
I received an email.

621
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,870
Like...

622
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,050
And, like...

623
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,550
The email was like...

624
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,150
You talked about Pirate Software in one of his tweets a couple of months ago.

625
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,130
I'm here to advise you to stay out of it.

626
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,930
Like, stay out of it.

627
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,350
And don't associate with Pirate Software.

628
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,610
And then, I'm just like...

629
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,870
I was like...

630
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,910
What the...

631
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,970
I was like...

632
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,550
Yeah, I don't remember what the fuck that tweet I talked about on stream.

633
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,990
I mean, that man tweets so much.

634
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:21,570
And, like, all his entire, like, stream persona is to be on the Shorts algorithm and Twitter algorithm.

635
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,650
So, like...

636
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,270
Yeah, of course, one of his tweets showed up and I talked about it.

637
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,670
Because it must have been something...

638
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,270
It must have been something that made me talk about it.

639
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,970
Because that's why I talk about these things.

640
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,010
Like, he said something that made me want to talk about it.

641
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:34,930
And...

642
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,450
But then, I was like...

643
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,730
But then, like...

644
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,370
I thought it was...

645
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,990
I thought it was so funny.

646
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,730
Because, like...

647
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,970
I don't care.

648
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,390
Yeah.

649
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,590
So...

650
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,830
So, like...

651
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,150
Okay, this is why I don't have much of an opinion about World of Warcraft.

652
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:57,170
Because my dad used to love World of Warcraft.

653
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,430
And, um...

654
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,150
And he would make me play with him every day.

655
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,670
Um...

656
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,670
Like, when I got home from school.

657
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,850
And...

658
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,310
But then, like, it will all be in Chinese.

659
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,630
So, I had no idea what the fuck was going on.

660
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,370
But, like, he just wanted someone to play with.

661
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,110
But he didn't want to join a guild.

662
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,290
So, he made me play with him.

663
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,690
Until, like...

664
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,830
He got, like, a flying mount.

665
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,190
And then, after...

666
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,030
Because, like, he just grinded until he got a flying mount.

667
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,610
And then, after he got a flying mount, he was like...

668
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,870
I'm done with this game.

669
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,230
And then, after he was done with this game...

670
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,590
I was done with the game.

671
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,490
It was sweet at first.

672
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,850
I had fun at first.

673
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,710
But then, like...

674
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,490
I don't know what's going on.

675
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,990
So, like, I never...

676
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,270
And then, like, I wanted to do other things.

677
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:52,970
Like...

678
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:54,830
I didn't...

679
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,210
I didn't want to play World of Warcraft all the time.

680
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,650
I wanted to play other things.

681
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,070
Like...

682
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,630
So, like...

683
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,110
Because of that experience, I've never touched World of Warcraft after that.

684
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,410
So...

685
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,870
That's why I just...

686
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,710
I don't care.

687
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,890
I don't care about what's going on in World of Warcraft.

688
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,710
But, like, the context of the whole drama...

689
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,090
It's actually crazy that the drama was so big, though.

690
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,170
Because I didn't...

691
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,770
Basically, it's called Roachgate.

692
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,050
And, like, it's the whole, like...

693
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,930
I'm not gonna give my opinion on it.

694
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,650
Because, like, that's the whole reason there's drama about it.

695
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,970
Because they're like, do you agree?

696
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,870
I just think, like...

697
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,470
It's just the fact that, like...

698
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,330
He fucking, like, left his team to die.

699
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,530
And then...

700
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,650
And then that's...

701
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,390
That's basically the whole gist of it.

702
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,270
And he just didn't say sorry.

703
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,310
And...

704
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,610
Or took accountability.

705
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,370
The craziest thing, I feel like, is if he actually just said sorry...

706
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,570
Nobody would say anything about this drama.

707
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,910
That's really it.

708
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,770
It just became bigger than it should be.

709
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,310
That's really it.

710
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,650
That's really it.

711
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,710
It's...

712
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,890
It's always ego.

713
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,850
This is what I mean.

714
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,690
I literally came out of my bubble.

715
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,150
I came out of my YouTube bubble.

716
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,790
And it's just egos.

717
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,930
Yeah.

718
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,710
But after all this I thought...

719
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,550
Maybe things were different.

720
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,490
You do not know everything, boy.

721
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,030
No.

722
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,870
But yeah, I'm not here to actually give my opinion who was right and who was wrong.

723
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:06,190
If like, I just don't say like, even if he thinks he was right or he thinks he was wrong, if he- he just- he didn't have to believe in his apology.

724
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:06,930
Like...

725
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:14,770
Like, if he- he knew by not taking accountability it was gonna get into a bigger issue.

726
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,670
It would grow into a bigger thing.

727
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,490
I would have just said sorry, but I wouldn't believe him.

728
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,990
I wouldn't believe I was wrong.

729
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,030
If I was like- if I was in his shoes and I think I was right.

730
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,550
Obviously, I don't know what the fuck- I don't really care in general.

731
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,670
I don't care about World of Warcraft in general because of my terrible- not my terrible experience, but because I'm tired out when I was a kid.

732
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,600
So, I'm in a story.

733
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,420
Can you turn into an animal?

734
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,680
No, you can't.

735
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,060
Can Kratos turn into an- have you ever seen your father turn into an animal, boy?

736
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,640
Don't be stupid.

737
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,340
That's right, I'm a what?

738
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
You're a god, boy.

739
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,460
I'm a what?

740
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,240
I'm a god.

741
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,000
Why did you wait so long to tell me?

742
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,020
I had hoped to spare you.

743
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,660
Being a god.

744
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
It can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy.

745
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Because you grew up to be a pussy at first.

746
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,760
That is the curse.

747
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,620
So, I felt like you didn't have the god in you.

748
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
What sorts of things can I do?

749
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,920
Can I fly?

750
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,660
Turn invisible?

751
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,880
You try to use magic.

752
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,550
Artaeus, boy, did you not hear me?

753
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,050
Being a god is not what it cuts out to be.

754
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,750
Your mother is dead!

755
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,850
That's the price of being a god.

756
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,150
All right.

757
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:27,210
Is this why you're schizophrenic?

758
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,250
That's- Thanks, boy.

759
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,590
You already do, laddie.

760
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,330
Your faculty for language is extraordinary for one so young.

761
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,070
Time alone will tell what else you'll become capable of.

762
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,850
So you knew all along.

763
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,070
I did, lad.

764
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,770
But I've known more than my share of gods.

765
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,250
Me too, apparently.

766
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,690
All right.

767
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,770
Yeah, like I said, I don't give opinions on things I don't really care much about.

768
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,030
Or like, it's outside my territory.

769
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:12,010
I just also think it's very fucking funny that we live in a time and place where we're witnessing Elon Musk fucking having an argument with Asmongold.

770
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,330
I think that's fucking hilarious.

771
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,790
I didn't realize he has the power.

772
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,590
Yeah, we are.

773
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,710
We're fucking gods.

774
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,530
Yeah, we've been doing what we've always been doing.

775
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,990
I was already a god.

776
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,490
I think the craziest part is that I didn't realize he could do that.

777
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:44,650
But if Elon Musk really, really hates you, he'll take away your check- like your verified check mark.

778
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,190
Like, I'm like, did he pay for that?

779
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,030
I'm just like, that's so petty.

780
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,230
He took away his check mark.

781
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,150
That's insane.

782
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,470
Yeah, yeah, you got that.

783
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,870
Like, I'm like, but like, I thought it was a paid feature.

784
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,570
That is insanely petty.

785
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,630
There's like, you're no longer verified.

786
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,610
Alright, read, boy.

787
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,760
Alright, what else does it say, boy?

788
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,300
Is that it?

789
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,140
Oh, fuck.

790
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,280
Okay, I guess we go forward.

791
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,700
Alright, thanks, boy.

792
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,980
Let's open the door!

793
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,920
Wait, we go back inside.

794
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,920
Wait a minute, what?

795
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,740
There's two entrances?

796
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,400
Oh, shit, let's go back inside, boy.

797
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,660
Looks like he still has the check mark.

798
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,180
Yeah, he gave it back after people were like, what the fuck?

799
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,040
That's so petty.

800
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,520
Earth.

801
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,420
This says earth, then what else do we have to do, boy?

802
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,180
Read.

803
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, okay, now do the thing, boy!

804
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,120
That's such a shitty god power.

805
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,060
He's just very, very good at languages.

806
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,620
Like...

807
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,580
That's such- I don't know.

808
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,200
Seems like a shitty god power.

809
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,700
No like, strength or invincibility.

810
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,540
You just know how to read.

811
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,040
He just reads really, really well.

812
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,580
Oh no, he's growing an ego.

813
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,080
It's time to end him.

814
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,140
Oh no, he's gonna become a streamer!

815
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,980
We gotta stop him!

816
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,120
We got it!

817
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,560
His ego is growing!

818
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,880
No!

819
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
Don't you mind teaching us some Mandarin?

820
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,860
I need it for red note.

821
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,480
Thank you for the super chat, Gavin.

822
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,240
Thank you, thank you.

823
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,760
Oh shit, sorry for pausing it.

824
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,840
I need to open up my...

825
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,960
Um, super chat area.

826
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,500
Oh yeah, I saw an Akka.

827
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,960
I'm so sorry I didn't read the Akka.

828
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,940
Uh, JL, thank you for the Akka Super!

829
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,860
Thank you, thank you!

830
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,720
Next up, an official appearance as a full skin in a game.

831
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,120
Maybe even an entire character!

832
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,720
JL, thank you for the Akka Super!

833
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,500
Thank you, thank you!

834
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,020
I hope so.

835
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,900
I hope so in the future.

836
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,760
Thank you!

837
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:01,880
Oh...

838
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,660
How dare he?

839
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,060
How dare he share our knowledge to the world?

840
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,260
It doesn't make us special anymore!

841
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,380
How fucking dare he?

842
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,600
I hope...

843
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,200
Did he die?

844
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,560
I'm pretty sure...

845
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,620
Yeah, whatever happened.

846
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,520
Oh, I fucking knew it.

847
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,560
Yeah, but they deserved it, right?

848
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,700
Are you trying to say gods did something wrong?

849
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,480
Us?

850
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,700
There's no way.

851
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,320
Gods are always right.

852
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,580
That's why we're gods.

853
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,240
We gotta smite him.

854
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,260
Oh!

855
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Oh my god, it's so pretty!

856
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,820
Hello, thank you for the super chat!

857
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,760
Thank you, thank you!

858
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,220
Whoa!

859
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,300
It's like when...

860
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,840
Doki had that little bump added to her reference.

861
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,240
So much ego!

862
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,700
Thank you for the super chat!

863
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,460
Thank you, thank you!

864
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,460
Boy, put your hands through this!

865
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,060
Now that you're a god, you'll live!

866
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,300
What the fuck?

867
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,860
What do you mean naturally?

868
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,040
What the fuck does this mean?

869
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,380
Oh yes, of course!

870
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Of course, the floating triple rings as it should be.

871
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,420
Okay, deactivate the vault's defenses.

872
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,880
Quite natural.

873
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,620
How do I deactivate it?

874
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,420
Oh, is there anything here?

875
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,240
I just...

876
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,620
No?

877
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,280
What the fuck yo- It's a puzzle.

878
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,440
I know it's- Oh wait, there's something here.

879
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,220
There's something here.

880
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,700
Oh wait, that's health.

881
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,600
Wait, that's not good.

882
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,180
Oh, is this a maze?

883
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,440
No, it's just one way.

884
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,120
Never mind.

885
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,640
What?

886
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,300
I love puzzles!

887
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,240
What?

888
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,600
Do I shoot this?

889
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,660
Shoot this, boy!

890
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,500
I forgot how to shoot.

891
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,300
Shoot this, boy!

892
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,720
Shoot this?

893
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,100
No?

894
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,120
Wait...

895
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,420
No?

896
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,400
I have my- Don't worry, I have another thing.

897
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,060
No?

898
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,900
Okay.

899
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,240
Uh...

900
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,120
Is it here?

901
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,140
No, there's something I have to do.

902
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,560
Come on, Doki.

903
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,380
Use your brain.

904
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,040
You're slowly waking up now.

905
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,740
Doki, you got this.

906
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,780
Your brain has been revved up.

907
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,780
Please, you're supposed to complete this today.

908
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,300
Where is the one?

909
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,660
What?

910
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,480
What?

911
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,060
My brain is so...

912
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,620
Come on!

913
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,100
Brain cell!

914
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,300
Where's the bright green thing?

915
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,840
There's no bright green thing anywhere.

916
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,920
I'm like running around.

917
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,680
Wait, is there a bright green thing in the back?

918
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,640
Back here?

919
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,360
No, there shouldn't be.

920
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,320
Is there any behind the doors?

921
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,580
Okay, no.

922
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,120
Oh god.

923
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,220
I looked at it!

924
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,450
Oh god, okay.

925
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,210
Okay.

926
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,370
I didn't realize that it was right there.

927
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,650
I didn't realize it was on the fucking giant ass ring.

928
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,730
Alright, now we pull.

929
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,600
Alright, I believe in you boy.

930
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,500
Go do the thing.

931
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,600
Now that you're a god, you're practically invincible, right?

932
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,600
That's how it works, right?

933
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,840
Wait, is he coming there with me?

934
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,740
Come on, do it!

935
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,300
Wait, where's my boy?

936
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,540
Fucking pussy, you found out you're a god and now you don't want to do this?

937
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,960
How do you not- oh shit.

938
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,460
Wait, what?

939
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,760
Oh, there's one.

940
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,760
How do you find out you're a god and now you decide to be a fucking coward?

941
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,900
Your boy of mine's gonna be a coward.

942
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,340
How did you get here?

943
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,260
Wait a minute.

944
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,320
Oh?

945
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,210
Is this old wine?

946
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:15,670
Drink it, Katos.

947
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,290
Become an alcoholic again.

948
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:20,210
You might as well, you got the dead beat part, right?

949
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,870
Steal it.

950
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,430
Wait, that's me!

951
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,790
Look, son, I'm famous!

952
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,750
It's what I used to do, son.

953
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,810
I basically did the same thing- oh.

954
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,890
I mean, it's not different from before.

955
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,950
Like, I still- I kill things now and I used to kill things.

956
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,410
Like, my boy's not gonna think it's different.

957
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:10,950
Oh, it's like- Tiara, like, collected different things from the gods- from different gods or different societies.

958
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,810
It's my merch!

959
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,850
Buy my merch!

960
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,390
Why does that say square?

961
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,030
Okay.

962
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,790
That did absolutely nothing.

963
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,350
Oh, okay, now I registered.

964
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,910
A lot of incest.

965
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,610
So it's sort of like- it depends on- I guess- I guess you can say bad?

966
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:52,530
What?

967
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,810
That's what the Egyptian gods did!

968
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,670
Some people- you guys didn't know that?

969
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,430
It's not like I was lying!

970
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,090
Alright, get over here.

971
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,530
Like, I wasn't lying about that!

972
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,110
I was just saying how it is!

973
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,650
Alright, use your- use your wolf!

974
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,530
Get that wolf in!

975
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,210
Oh shit, no, that's not the one weapon I want to use.

976
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,130
I want to use the sword, honestly.

977
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,330
The sword is so cool.

978
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:33,570
Wait.

979
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:34,470
Oh, wait.

980
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,070
Oh my god.

981
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:38,730
Get over here!

982
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,210
Get over here!

983
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,410
Boy, I can't shoot you over the sound of my fucking coolness!

984
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,590
My testosterone is going up right now!

985
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,510
Oh my god!

986
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,510
I feel so much joy!

987
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,010
Get over here.

988
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,770
Oh yeah, you're right, all the Egyptians did it.

989
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:07,550
It's not just- it's not just a god, it was just- he doesn't understand, it was just a way of life.

990
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,970
If you weren't- if you weren't being a family member, what were you doing?

991
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,190
Like the old Egyptian people were saying back then.

992
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,230
Alright.

993
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:23,670
Oh, nice.

994
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,690
Tryna- okay, R1.

995
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,170
Don't keep- it's true!

996
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:36,750
I'm not- I'm just- I'm just giving you guys a history lesson!

997
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,530
Oh my god, I might actually die from this history lesson.

998
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,030
Give me a sec.

999
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,850
I might die because of history.

1000
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:53,830
It's true, you don't- you're not supposed to say- I'm just educating!

1001
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,090
What's wrong with education?

1002
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:20,870
Alright, let's grab some HP because we are gonna die if we don't.

1003
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:25,010
I was too busy reciting history to figure out my health issues.

1004
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,890
Wait, aww.

1005
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,690
There was like-

1006
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,650
Yeah, I remember there was like a gate area that needed this.

1007
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,990
But like, which area was it?

1008
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:42,770
Was it here?

1009
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,470
Where did I come from?

1010
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,790
I came from here, right?

1011
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,990
Wait, no, this is different?

1012
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:55,870
I'm lost.

1013
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,980
Oh no, this is- I already forgot where I was.

1014
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:10,320
Oh, I legitimately- oh no, there's too many entranceways.

1015
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,340
Okay, okay, I came from here, I remember now.

1016
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,600
Why is there so many- but then there's like an upstairs!

1017
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,400
Oh no, my head hurts.

1018
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,960
Oh no, I don't know if I can finish this in six hours now.

1019
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:28,880
Alright, MrBrokenBot, thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

1020
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,160
Doki talks about incest while ignoring her son's cry of help.

1021
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,760
Guys, I had to give a history lesson.

1022
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,920
Boy was interrupting education.

1023
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,300
Okay, this way.

1024
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,220
I have no idea what this- where this is supposed to take me.

1025
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,220
Oh, okay, there's a win area here, too.

1026
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:57,930
Read, boy.

1027
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,010
Use your special god powers.

1028
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,170
Can't believe it.

1029
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,730
That's all he has?

1030
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,130
That's so sad.

1031
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:15,550
You were born a god and all you can do is just read a little better.

1032
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,110
Like, what's the point?

1033
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,030
Alright, let's see.

1034
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,310
Oh shit, that's not what I want to do.

1035
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:28,170
Oops.

1036
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,450
Uh, there we go.

1037
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:37,670
I raised the f- the worst god power in existence, honestly.

1038
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,290
You could have had every- you could have had anything else, boy.

1039
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,440
Oh my god, come on, get over here.

1040
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,720
Is this not how I grab the wind?

1041
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,360
I can't grab it here?

1042
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,340
Am I too far?

1043
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,800
I guess I am too far.

1044
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,060
I thought I could grab it from here.

1045
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,170
Can I grab it from down here?

1046
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,150
Okay, can I go up with it?

1047
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:15,870
Oh, I can.

1048
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:23,650
Oh my god, boy, I wish- oh my god, that was- Oh, I'm just missing?

1049
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:32,690
Oh, I was like, okay, if my boy was not chicken grabbing onto me, um, then, like, I could have hit it.

1050
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,190
I could have been up there faster.

1051
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,530
Okay, so I was just missing, then.

1052
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,190
Because there was a- there was a thing on the other side, right?

1053
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,700
Is this a- oh, it's because I need to time it.

1054
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,280
Because, like, I remember on this side, there was another one, too, that I had to use.

1055
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,720
I had to time it, I see.

1056
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,740
Oh my god, oh, I'm gonna freaking freak out.

1057
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,620
I'm- okay, okay.

1058
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,760
Okay, I need to time this.

1059
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,780
I hate this already.

1060
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,340
Oh my god, no, no, no.

1061
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:16,600
Yes!

1062
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,200
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1063
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:21,680
It's right here.

1064
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,200
There we go.

1065
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,680
What does that do?

1066
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
What did I do?

1067
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,620
What did I- okay, but what does that do?

1068
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,800
I did it, but what?

1069
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,220
It looks a little cooler, but what does it do?

1070
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,270
Is there another one that I missed out on?

1071
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,490
This was the one I did, right?

1072
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,160
What did- what did it do?

1073
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,660
Is that it?

1074
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,300
I made it cooler.

1075
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,620
I mean, it does look pretty cool.

1076
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,100
I mean, yeah.

1077
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,220
It does make it look pretty cool.

1078
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:26,620
I guess on the other side, that this one over here, but like, I feel like- oh no, what?

1079
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,120
No!

1080
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,820
Fuck, okay, I have to run faster.

1081
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,920
I mean, now that I know it's like right here.

1082
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,240
Grab it faster.

1083
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,500
I didn't know where I was.

1084
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,180
I guess I had to go here.

1085
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,820
What the fuck?

1086
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:43,600
Okay.

1087
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,940
Okay, that was- that was awkward.

1088
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,540
Alright, I guess that was it.

1089
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:55,740
Nice.

1090
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,620
Well, I guess I do this.

1091
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,660
Just because you hate being a god doesn't mean I have more small passages.

1092
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,140
Alright.

1093
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,080
Oh shit.

1094
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,280
Alright, and then we climb up.

1095
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:19,720
What?

1096
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,960
Oh, I thought I could climb.

1097
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,800
Okay, we go to that.

1098
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,680
And then we go here.

1099
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:30,740
Okay.

1100
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,320
Sorry, boy.

1101
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,680
This is much more important.

1102
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,560
Oh, nice.

1103
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:47,690
Yes.

1104
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,110
Oh, that's so cute.

1105
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,430
They look cute.

1106
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:57,130
They look pretty friendly.

1107
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,430
I didn't realize he was dropping important lore.

1108
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,250
I just saw a puzzle room.

1109
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:13,730
I was like, oh puzzle.

1110
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,370
How was I supposed to know?

1111
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:24,370
I have to do fucking puzzles.

1112
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,530
I killed my other family and wear them as my skin now.

1113
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:36,950
So yeah, it's pretty alright.

1114
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,450
I came from here, right?

1115
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,690
Yeah, I came from here.

1116
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:52,990
So like...

1117
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,470
Why are there like two more traps?

1118
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,350
Is there like bonus stuff here?

1119
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:01,910
I assume maybe?

1120
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,350
Maybe there's like bonus.

1121
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,770
Oh, it is bonus!

1122
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,620
Okay.

1123
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,640
That means there are bonus things to do.

1124
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,360
Where the fuck is CRN?

1125
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,840
Oh my god, I hate these.

1126
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,720
I hate these puzzles.

1127
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,440
I have so- oh my god.

1128
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:33,800
Okay.

1129
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,720
Uh...

1130
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,320
Where's my other- where's my axe?

1131
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,040
Where did it go?

1132
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,540
Where did my axe go?

1133
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:52,070
Where did my axe go?

1134
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,730
Oh, there it is.

1135
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,690
Oh, it was still attached to the other thing.

1136
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,610
Oh, there's the other one.

1137
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,490
Okay, we got one of them.

1138
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:03,510
Where's the other two?

1139
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,050
It's in here?

1140
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,680
The fuck is the other two?

1141
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,300
I'm looking up.

1142
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:17,720
Huh?

1143
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,120
I thought- I got the CE.

1144
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,940
Oh, I hate these puzzles the most.

1145
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,420
These puzzles are actually- I'm gonna fucking freak out.

1146
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,500
These puzzles are like- Oh my god, I hate these puzzles the most.

1147
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,240
Where's Waldo?

1148
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,220
Where's Waldo?

1149
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,700
Where is he?

1150
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,660
Where the fuck is he?

1151
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,470
Oh my god, I'm gonna- I'm gonna break something.

1152
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,910
The fact that someone's like, you looked at it.

1153
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,150
I'm like, whaaat?

1154
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,680
Like, they all have to be in this vicinity.

1155
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,580
And it's blue, but everything else is blue too!

1156
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:30,790
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm gonna fucking- oh my god.

1157
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,680
Where is it?

1158
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,360
Where is it?

1159
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,380
My stress level is rising.

1160
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,440
Where the fuck is Waldo?

1161
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,500
Where is he?

1162
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,420
It does not help!

1163
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,180
It's like- Boom!

1164
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,480
Boom!

1165
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:55,940
Boom!

1166
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,560
Boom!

1167
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:00,060
Boom!

1168
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:05,630
Where is it?

1169
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:08,830
Where the fuck is it?

1170
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,230
If I look over here, will I see it?

1171
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,310
I don't understand.

1172
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:21,150
In the center of the room?

1173
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,680
Ow.

1174
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,160
What?

1175
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:39,770
What?

1176
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:41,590
Above me?

1177
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:41,650
Above me?

1178
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,010
What?

1179
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,410
I can't.

1180
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,450
I- Can they be in different rooms?

1181
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,450
Or is it just in that one room?

1182
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:03,810
There's no way it's outside.

1183
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,350
Has to be like, just that room, right?

1184
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,890
Look around the other room.

1185
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,590
How do you know they can be in other rooms?

1186
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,690
Oh, it can be!

1187
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,790
Oh my god!

1188
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:26,790
It can be in other rooms.

1189
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:27,890
It can be in other rooms.

1190
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:28,670
Oh my god.

1191
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,790
I can't believe I was stuck in that one room.

1192
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:34,390
I did not realize it could be in other rooms.

1193
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,370
Okay, we're missing one more letter.

1194
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:40,770
We just need one more letter.

1195
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:42,590
Hello there, big boy.

1196
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,340
Okay, one more.

1197
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,220
Where's the last one?

1198
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:51,360
N.

1199
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,780
The last one is N.

1200
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,080
Close by?

1201
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:58,460
The fuck does that mean?

1202
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,440
Oh, I hate these puzzles so much.

1203
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,940
I remember when they were so easy.

1204
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,820
Like, they're literally in your face.

1205
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,640
And now they're like, here's 200 million items.

1206
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,100
Find the letters.

1207
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,700
No, it's N.

1208
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,640
It can't be.

1209
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,760
Is it really behind these?

1210
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:31,950
I don't see it.

1211
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:40,110
I don't see it.

1212
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,390
Oh, the other one?

1213
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,140
No, it has to be...

1214
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,860
This one, right?

1215
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,480
Is it here?

1216
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,520
Oh shit!

1217
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,700
No,

1218
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:07,790
don't make me!

1219
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:08,630
No!

1220
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,310
Where am I?!

1221
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:12,550
What the dude

1222
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,570
is here?!

1223
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,310
There's no way!

1224
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:26,770
Oh my god.

1225
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,670
I'm so sad.

1226
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:31,840
I actually have to...

1227
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,890
I'm so sad.

1228
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,790
Oh my god.

1229
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:38,830
Oh,

1230
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,310
I'm so sad.

1231
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:48,330
I'm so sad.

1232
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,370
I got confused.

1233
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:59,490
Oh my god.

1234
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:05,470
I hate this.

1235
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:11,650
Okay, I know it was behind this.

1236
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,700
It's like, right here.

1237
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,440
Or right here.

1238
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,480
Oh fuck.

1239
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,320
How did I fucking...

1240
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,400
Oh my god.

1241
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,120
Alright.

1242
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,860
There we go.

1243
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,920
That was one of them.

1244
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,520
Alright.

1245
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,820
And then the other one was like...

1246
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:44,320
here.

1247
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:48,960
Alright.

1248
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,740
Then where's the last one?

1249
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,580
There's the last one in this one, right?

1250
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,180
The last one in this one?

1251
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:09,610
Guys, before I go over there, is the last one in this ruin?

1252
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,360
Okay.

1253
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,160
I will not get squished by them this time.

1254
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,860
I will not get squished by them this time.

1255
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,580
Alright.

1256
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:32,980
Where is it?

1257
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,720
Did I lie to you?

1258
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,000
You lied to me?

1259
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,550
You guys lied to me?

1260
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,860
You guys lied?

1261
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,320
Where is it?

1262
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:54,880
I

1263
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,780
am on the other side!

1264
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,440
Oh my god!

1265
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,400
The fuck?

1266
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,400
Where is it?

1267
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,420
Oh my god.

1268
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,760
I died here for nothing.

1269
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:20,090
I actually died there for nothing?

1270
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:25,930
Oh my god!

1271
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,380
I hate you guys.

1272
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,360
I hate you guys.

1273
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,160
I hate you guys.

1274
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,700
I hate you guys.

1275
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,700
I hate you guys.

1276
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,600
It was on the same side.

1277
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,620
It was on the same side.

1278
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,280
Alright, open.

1279
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,080
Nice, what did I get?

1280
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:57,900
Was it worth it?

1281
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,360
It was one out of the three.

1282
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,080
I guess it was worth it.

1283
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,120
Oh my god.

1284
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,040
Now where am I supposed to go?

1285
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,400
I don't know.

1286
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,880
I'm like so lost now.

1287
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,440
I came back here.

1288
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,040
But like...

1289
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,120
Where am I supposed to go?

1290
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,540
Did I come from here?

1291
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,800
No, this is different.

1292
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,820
This is a new area, right?

1293
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,300
I can't.

1294
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,620
Everything is blurring together.

1295
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,240
Okay.

1296
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,040
This is new.

1297
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,640
I don't know.

1298
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,140
There's a trap there in front of me.

1299
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,940
I don't know.

1300
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:57,930
I wonder what these traps are guarding.

1301
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,550
What will I find out now?

1302
01:09:59,550 --> 01:09:59,630
I don't know.

1303
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,230
I haven't been here, right?

1304
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,270
This is new.

1305
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,310
I can never tell.

1306
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:08,310
I'm so confused.

1307
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:16,590
Yeah, this has to be new.

1308
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,370
Wait, I have been?

1309
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,110
Oh, wait.

1310
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,910
This is where I've been.

1311
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:26,110
Ow.

1312
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:26,970
Sorry.

1313
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:28,250
I fucked up.

1314
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:30,550
But how did I do this?

1315
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,690
I don't remember how I did this.

1316
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,360
I don't remember.

1317
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:45,020
How did I do this?

1318
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,180
Oh, it's right here.

1319
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:47,480
Okay.

1320
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,860
Wait, am I stuck?

1321
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,260
No.

1322
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,120
I can do this.

1323
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:03,980
Yeah.

1324
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,240
I remembered.

1325
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,100
Alright.

1326
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:08,220
Okay.

1327
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:11,640
I'm so lost.

1328
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,340
I'm so lost.

1329
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,560
I'm so fucking lost.

1330
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,540
I can't remember where I've been anymore.

1331
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,210
They all look the same.

1332
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,410
Everything looks the same.

1333
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,670
All these traps.

1334
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,110
I've played these games before.

1335
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,370
Alright.

1336
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:41,790
Wait, have I been here?

1337
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,780
Okay.

1338
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,400
Is this new?

1339
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,740
Wait a minute.

1340
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,380
What?

1341
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,120
I just went backwards.

1342
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,140
I'm back here.

1343
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,860
I'm so lost.

1344
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,500
Oh my god.

1345
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,600
My yellow paint is

1346
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:17,450
in...

1347
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:18,610
Have I been here?

1348
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,550
Oh my god.

1349
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,310
I ran around in a circle.

1350
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,540
Okay.

1351
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,600
Maybe it's like here somewhere.

1352
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:31,520
Right?

1353
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,580
Okay, I went through that.

1354
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,980
What was over here?

1355
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,300
What was over here again?

1356
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,080
Okay, so...

1357
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,200
This is the wolf puzzle.

1358
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,440
Oh wait, there's heals here.

1359
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,220
I don't need the heals though.

1360
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,980
Oh, I needed the wind for that!

1361
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:02,510
Okay.

1362
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:04,450
Boy, I figured it out.

1363
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,370
I need wind.

1364
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:09,870
Oh my god.

1365
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,110
I forgot to open the door!

1366
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:16,490
I did it.

1367
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:17,930
Okay.

1368
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,330
Where did I leave the wind?

1369
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,550
Where did the wind go?

1370
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,210
Wait, where did the wind go?

1371
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,370
Is it back up here?

1372
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:39,470
Oh, it is.

1373
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:40,830
Oh shit.

1374
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,030
I did not mean to use my hands.

1375
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:46,990
What the...

1376
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:48,690
Oh shit.

1377
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:49,590
Wait, that's cool.

1378
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:50,750
Wait, I can do that?

1379
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,710
Is this what gamers call parry?

1380
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:57,930
Oh my god.

1381
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:59,930
Is this what it's like to parry?

1382
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:03,830
Alright.

1383
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:06,710
Oh wait, I forgot I have a boy to shoot them.

1384
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,690
Alright.

1385
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:11,190
Baseball!

1386
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,060
Alright, come on boy.

1387
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,120
Shoot your arrow!

1388
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,540
Shoot it!

1389
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,080
Be useful, boy!

1390
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:25,130
Continue to be useful.

1391
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,090
Nice, alright.

1392
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,530
Now I need to...

1393
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,650
I guess I'll put it in here.

1394
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,510
And I'll lower it.

1395
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:35,810
Yeah!

1396
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,990
Why did I put it side by side?

1397
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,930
Don't forget my wife's what?

1398
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:48,850
Okay, sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.

1399
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:49,770
I only have one weapon.

1400
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,950
Alright, nice.

1401
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:59,190
We did it.

1402
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:03,050
The only reason I was stuck is because I forgot I had...

1403
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,070
I forgot about the door right here.

1404
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:06,510
I forgot!

1405
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:08,330
It's because I died!

1406
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:10,730
Of course I forgot!

1407
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:12,310
I fucking died!

1408
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:13,030
Oh shit.

1409
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,670
You won with nature.

1410
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,450
What is it doing?

1411
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:29,210
Which one?

1412
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,350
Get the green wire!

1413
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,210
Use your god power!

1414
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:49,090
Your most useless god power out there.

1415
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,310
Oh my god.

1416
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:51,350
What do you mean?

1417
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,830
Wait, what?

1418
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:56,790
Wait,

1419
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,360
how do I make him shift?

1420
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,140
Oh shit!

1421
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,620
Oh fuck!

1422
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:10,900
I didn't know!

1423
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,640
I'm panicking!

1424
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,980
I put it in the wrong one!

1425
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,240
Oh fuck!

1426
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,240
I guess I'll just...

1427
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,140
I guess I'll drown.

1428
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,400
I put it in the wrong order, guys.

1429
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,480
It was an accident.

1430
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,060
I was freaking out.

1431
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,660
Guys, I was so confused!

1432
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,400
No, I didn't mean to die in the middle!

1433
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,640
Oh guys, I was freaking out.

1434
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,120
Guys, I was freaking out.

1435
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,980
I didn't know I could...

1436
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,660
The boy could do this without my help, guys!

1437
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,050
I legitimately thought...

1438
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,280
I thought I could...

1439
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,300
I didn't know, I thought...

1440
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,460
Oh fuck, okay.

1441
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,280
The middle!

1442
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:05,020
Okay.

1443
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,960
This is it, I can do this.

1444
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,000
I can fix this.

1445
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,180
No!

1446
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,650
I didn't realize I could do more.

1447
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:30,830
I thought the boy was gonna do this for me.

1448
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,670
I was gonna be like...

1449
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,830
Yippee, boy!

1450
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,990
You're gonna...

1451
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:37,450
Boy, you're gonna fucking...

1452
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:42,510
Oh wait, what the fuck am I doing?

1453
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:43,110
Oh my god.

1454
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:46,350
They actually just put it in order for me.

1455
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,190
Oh my god, I fucked it up.

1456
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,770
I already fucked it up.

1457
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,890
Oh my god, I am panicking.

1458
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,250
I am panicking.

1459
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,950
I already fucked it up.

1460
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,650
I already fucked it up.

1461
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:03,230
I didn't know.

1462
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,110
I was panicking.

1463
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,450
I didn't know.

1464
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,170
Okay.

1465
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:14,470
Alright.

1466
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:15,590
Middle.

1467
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:20,610
Okay.

1468
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:23,570
Oh my god.

1469
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,410
I gotta keep pulling.

1470
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,430
Wait, how the fuck do I fix this?

1471
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:28,310
Oh!

1472
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,690
Oh my god, okay, I figured it out.

1473
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:31,450
I figured it out.

1474
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:34,010
And then...

1475
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,890
Oh no, no, please.

1476
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,230
Please don't do this.

1477
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:40,390
I'm panicking again, boy.

1478
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:40,950
Please.

1479
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:43,570
Okay.

1480
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:45,290
No!

1481
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:45,890
No!

1482
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,010
I was so close!

1483
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:53,230
I keep panicking.

1484
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,910
I don't do well at this.

1485
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:57,440
I don't do...

1486
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,410
I...

1487
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,590
It all makes sense in my head.

1488
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:02,230
But I just can't...

1489
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:05,110
I just can't be like...

1490
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,510
Middle.

1491
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,430
The middle boy.

1492
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,550
Just keep putting it in the middle.

1493
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:13,690
Oh my god.

1494
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:15,370
Okay, there you go, there you go, there you go.

1495
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:17,030
I figured it out.

1496
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,850
Oh my god, why is it...

1497
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:24,050
Why is it faster?

1498
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:27,850
I felt like I had more time before when I was panicking, boy.

1499
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:32,690
Yes, I know.

1500
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:33,430
Yes, I know.

1501
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,450
Why couldn't he do this himself?

1502
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,310
I don't understand.

1503
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,850
Why am I the one that's...

1504
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:38,670
Oh my god.

1505
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:40,030
Okay, the middle.

1506
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:44,110
There we go.

1507
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:48,370
We did it.

1508
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:51,430
Wait, is that not it?

1509
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:54,550
That's not it?

1510
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:56,830
What is this?

1511
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:57,970
This is not the son?

1512
01:19:59,440 --> 01:19:59,710
No?

1513
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:01,150
Wait, what?

1514
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,350
Wait, what?

1515
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,370
Oh shit!

1516
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:12,650
Oh, I fucking beat him!

1517
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:14,070
I fucking beat him!

1518
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:14,850
I'm so dumb!

1519
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,130
I'm so dumb!

1520
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,150
I thought it had to be...

1521
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,390
Okay, I'm dumb.

1522
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,030
I thought...

1523
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:39,610
I thought it meant like...

1524
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:41,050
They had to be at the bottom.

1525
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:43,630
And I realized, oh, it has to be at the top.

1526
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:48,370
Guys, my brain is not awake yet.

1527
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,950
My brain is not awake.

1528
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:59,190
Oh my god.

1529
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,590
Do I have to tell you everything?

1530
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,370
You became a god and you became more stupid.

1531
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,990
Like, how is that possible?

1532
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:16,170
How did you become more stupid knowing you're a god?

1533
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:21,930
It's not working.

1534
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:23,890
Guess I died then.

1535
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:34,560
Alright.

1536
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,260
Well, it worked.

1537
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,080
Wait, he got rid of her.

1538
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,840
But that's your mom's knife.

1539
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,100
That's your mom's knife.

1540
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:47,460
That's your mom's knife though.

1541
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,800
That was your last connection to her.

1542
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,620
Oh no.

1543
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,840
He became a god and now...

1544
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,100
Now he's getting rid of his mortal possessions.

1545
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,240
Retrieve the black rune.

1546
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,920
Is that the black rune?

1547
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,220
Guys, I'm starting to not think we're gonna finish this game today.

1548
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,500
There it is.

1549
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,360
We've got it.

1550
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,450
I'm slowly starting to think.

1551
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:28,450
After that puzzle's performance, I don't think my brain is ready to finish this game today.

1552
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:45,750
Oh, he gets the god knife.

1553
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,110
You are a man now, my son.

1554
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,110
Now that you know you're a god.

1555
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,150
Oh shit, yes.

1556
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,790
No, what?

1557
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:03,690
No, yeah.

1558
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,570
You shall never be a man.

1559
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,870
We are boys.

1560
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:29,590
Boy, do not...

1561
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,490
Do not...

1562
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:35,150
Do not become one of the gods that fuck animals, boy.

1563
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:36,970
We have to be better.

1564
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:38,570
Or incest.

1565
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:40,990
We gotta be better, boy.

1566
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,560
Nice.

1567
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,540
Yeah, yippee!

1568
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,620
I did it.

1569
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,040
My little boy is growing up to still be a boy.

1570
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,460
What?

1571
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,280
Oh, I just can't read.

1572
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,650
What the fuck?

1573
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:36,670
It's like, on my skin.

1574
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,390
Why is it always...

1575
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:43,410
Oh my god.

1576
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:45,530
It's fucking...

1577
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:48,270
Oh no, oh it's fire.

1578
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:49,830
Okay, where's my...

1579
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:52,390
Why is it always fucking...

1580
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:54,770
Trolls!

1581
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:56,170
It's always trolls!

1582
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,530
When is it not trolls?

1583
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,730
Oh shit.

1584
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:06,150
When is it not trolls?

1585
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,530
It's always trolls.

1586
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:12,530
Wait, how the fuck do I...

1587
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:14,570
Oh wait, what?

1588
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,570
Oh wait, maybe I kill this guy.

1589
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,730
Maybe I kill him.

1590
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:28,370
I'm so confused, cause like, one is taking damage and the other one isn't.

1591
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,230
Why is it always trolls?

1592
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:36,410
Why can't it be something different?

1593
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:38,150
Oh shit.

1594
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:41,490
Oh my god, this is not fair.

1595
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:43,430
It's literally 2 to 1, it's not fair.

1596
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:45,030
It's so not fair.

1597
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,470
Oh my god, where's my axe?

1598
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,830
Where is...

1599
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:50,610
Oh my god!

1600
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,330
I hate being confused!

1601
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:16,300
Okay.

1602
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,100
Alright, nice, we did it.

1603
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,260
Rachel confusion.

1604
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,840
Alright, nice, we did it.

1605
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,640
Mawflame has no storage.

1606
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,080
Generate through the used upgrade.

1607
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,540
Oh nice, I get to upgrade my Blade of Chaos.

1608
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,000
I'm confused and I did one die with one HP.

1609
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:44,520
Jesus Christ.

1610
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,120
Nice, we did it.

1611
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,160
How do I leave?

1612
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,060
Oh, okay.

1613
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:56,640
Now it gives me the fucking checkpoint.

1614
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,540
The waypoint.

1615
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:57,720
Alright.

1616
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,440
You won't like it when I'm confused.

1617
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,320
Boy Reid.

1618
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:20,900
Yay, we're going back home now.

1619
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,040
It's always trolls.

1620
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,860
Why can't I fight something different?

1621
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:43,160
Oh, it's wine.

1622
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,520
Boy.

1623
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,740
You might be like 12.

1624
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,040
But it's time to get drunk.

1625
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,560
I'm a good father.

1626
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,740
It's just like this troll.

1627
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,560
You swag, thank you for the superchat.

1628
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,540
Thank you, thank you.

1629
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:58,820
What?

1630
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:06,240
To be fair, back in the ancient times, they used to drink a lot more at a younger age.

1631
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,600
Eddie, they're European, right?

1632
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:10,620
Makes sense, technically.

1633
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,260
Smells like rotten eggs.

1634
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,140
Is it still good?

1635
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,780
It's a European thing.

1636
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,660
I like how he just chucks it away.

1637
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:46,060
Oh my god, we're bonding.

1638
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,740
I'm finally bonding with my son.

1639
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,240
It only took like 13 years and a lot of killing.

1640
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:01,860
And my son almost dying because I never told him he was a god until now.

1641
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,820
Because your mom was pretty hot.

1642
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:20,580
Ha!

1643
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,560
Sure, boy.

1644
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,460
Just lie.

1645
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:35,840
I told you guys.

1646
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:37,520
Even if you don't believe it, just lie.

1647
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:49,090
Boom.

1648
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:54,230
I mean,

1649
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,620
like...

1650
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,280
I feel like nothing has changed since he learned about being a god.

1651
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,200
If anything, he's become more stupid.

1652
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,960
Oh no, I fucking...

1653
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,920
Oh no, he's gonna become a streamer, guys.

1654
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,280
Oh no.

1655
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,440
Oh no.

1656
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,500
His ego, guys.

1657
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:27,720
Oh no, his ego is growing in record speed, guys.

1658
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,780
I fucked up.

1659
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,180
Now he's gonna become a streamer.

1660
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,440
Oh no.

1661
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:36,560
No, boy.

1662
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:37,660
Please.

1663
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,360
Be the artist.

1664
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,180
Be the dancer artist you wanted to be before.

1665
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,140
I won't judge you anymore.

1666
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,480
Go be an artist, boy.

1667
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:56,620
Okay.

1668
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,580
I think it's this way, right?

1669
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,680
I'll just follow the...

1670
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,440
I'll just follow the yellow hat.

1671
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:07,740
Here we go.

1672
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:08,980
Up we go.

1673
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,180
I'm god and proud.

1674
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,400
Friends?

1675
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,180
What friends?

1676
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,120
We're gonna die alone.

1677
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:37,620
Oh boy, I'm sorry to tell you this, but we're dying alone.

1678
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,500
That's why your mother's dead.

1679
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,280
What?

1680
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,480
What?

1681
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,140
See?

1682
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:16,580
This is what happens to you if you don't become a man.

1683
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,140
Damn.

1684
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:43,720
Woah!

1685
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,000
Woah!

1686
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:54,460
Damn.

1687
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,820
You got roasted by a 12-year-old.

1688
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:57,360
Are you okay?

1689
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:05,550
Arteus, he fucking upgraded your bow for you.

1690
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:07,890
Oh no, he's gonna cry.

1691
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,630
Have you ever seen a dwarf cry?

1692
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:12,650
Look at him.

1693
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:14,110
He's holding back his tears.

1694
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:17,990
Arteus, that's a little...

1695
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,490
Woah, Arteus, that's a little...

1696
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:21,210
That's a little fucked up, bro.

1697
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:25,890
Alright, we can finally upgrade our chaos...

1698
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:27,370
Blaze of Chaos.

1699
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:28,710
Oh, he's crashing out.

1700
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,350
No, he's absolutely crashing out.

1701
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:31,770
And then...

1702
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:33,230
Can I get the... No, I can't.

1703
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:34,010
What about the bow?

1704
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:34,790
Oh no.

1705
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:36,950
Alright.

1706
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:39,970
I think he's gonna spit on your bow, but that's alright.

1707
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:40,950
Not my problem.

1708
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:43,330
Never yell at the help!

1709
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,530
They can spit on your things.

1710
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:50,370
Can I upgrade Axe Palmer?

1711
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,210
I feel like...

1712
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:56,170
I just feel like upgrading these don't matter.

1713
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:59,110
I feel like I can just find better items.

1714
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:03,850
Alright.

1715
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:03,970
Alright.

1716
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:11,600
Is there anything else I can...

1717
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,200
No, this was the best one I have.

1718
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:19,980
Momento from...

1719
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:23,420
Wait, Talisman of Concentrated Valley.

1720
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:24,800
I should get that.

1721
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:26,680
Defense.

1722
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:27,300
Oh, wait.

1723
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:28,700
Luck 12.

1724
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,520
Actually, I'll keep this.

1725
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:31,820
I keep luck of ages.

1726
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,640
He has a name!

1727
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:39,460
What, is he a god?

1728
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:40,700
I don't think so.

1729
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,520
Sorry, I only acknowledge gods in this.

1730
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:49,860
I only acknowledge the gods.

1731
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,350
Alright, let's see.

1732
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,290
I'm just gonna upgrade everything about the Blade of Chaos.

1733
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,900
And then we'll get Blade of Chaos maxed up.

1734
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:11,640
And then we'll give our boy some of the magic.

1735
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,920
We're gonna max his magic up.

1736
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,340
Holy shit!

1737
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,240
I have so much XP.

1738
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,180
Alright.

1739
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,660
And I've got this.

1740
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:30,020
And then we'll upgrade our axe.

1741
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:30,380
Yes!

1742
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,960
I feel like switching stances is gonna confuse the shit out of me.

1743
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:49,660
I feel like I'm gonna be more confused if I swap things up.

1744
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,680
Okay, I got this.

1745
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:56,700
There we go.

1746
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,400
Alright, let's go!

1747
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,300
Oh, nope.

1748
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,720
Nope, nope, that's the wrong one!

1749
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,200
Give me a sec.

1750
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:08,940
No!

1751
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,720
Why is it trolls again?!

1752
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:17,040
Why is it always trolls?!

1753
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:17,780
Please!

1754
01:36:18,660 --> 01:36:19,720
I'm so...

1755
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:23,220
I'm so fucking tired of trolls!

1756
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,160
Oh my god!

1757
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,200
I'm gonna fucking die!

1758
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,520
Surprise!

1759
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:34,980
Surprise!

1760
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:35,960
Trolls!

1761
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:41,340
I'm so tired of all these trolls and my fucking elo.

1762
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:53,840
It's just like magic.

1763
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,020
I'm so tired of trolls!

1764
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,940
It's always trolls!

1765
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,120
Oh, shit!

1766
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:10,520
Firewolves!

1767
01:37:14,110 --> 01:37:15,090
Wait, what?

1768
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:16,550
Is this Jenny?

1769
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,860
Oh my god.

1770
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:22,980
Get outta here!

1771
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,120
That's right.

1772
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,620
I'm unlocking you.

1773
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:30,980
Alright, nice.

1774
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:31,520
We did it.

1775
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,200
This is a troll too.

1776
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:35,300
Thank you.

1777
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,700
Alright, we gotta go this way.

1778
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,800
Oh my god.

1779
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,620
We should just kill our trolls, honestly.

1780
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:49,620
Alright, up we go.

1781
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,120
Woah!

1782
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,000
Woah!

1783
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:16,640
Mortal opinion matters, Artanis!

1784
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,800
Oh my god!

1785
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:24,340
Guys, I love all mortals, guys.

1786
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:27,200
His opinion does not speak for me.

1787
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,840
I love all mortals.

1788
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,200
I...

1789
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,960
Wait, where did my other weapon go?

1790
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,160
Oh, there it is.

1791
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,960
You absolutely did.

1792
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,540
Yeah, I have mortal friends, guys.

1793
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:44,600
Sorry, guys.

1794
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,920
He did not get that from me.

1795
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,780
Sorry, his mortal racism did not come from me, guys.

1796
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,800
I love all mortals.

1797
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,840
I even fucked a mortal and produced him as my son!

1798
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,460
I married a mortal.

1799
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:03,200
What?

1800
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:04,500
That she wasn't a god?

1801
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:09,600
She was hot and not my sister.

1802
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:16,880
It's the little things, boy.

1803
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,040
You don't understand.

1804
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:23,760
She wasn't my sister and that's already an improvement for all guys.

1805
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:26,740
I don't know.

1806
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:27,580
I can't see anything.

1807
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:28,980
I can't see anything.

1808
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:29,880
I hate this lightning.

1809
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:37,930
Alright, nice.

1810
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:38,230
Alright.

1811
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:40,490
There's so many things behind me!

1812
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:41,590
You gotta be specific!

1813
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,310
Everything is behind me!

1814
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:44,470
There's 200 enemies!

1815
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,690
Alright, there we go.

1816
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:48,090
We're fine.

1817
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:49,290
We're fine.

1818
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:52,370
Okay, nice.

1819
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,430
Did we kill them all?

1820
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:56,170
We did it!

1821
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:56,770
Yippee!

1822
01:39:58,370 --> 01:39:59,850
We killed them all!

1823
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,570
Turn around!

1824
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:22,130
Okay.

1825
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:24,410
Whoa!

1826
01:40:26,110 --> 01:40:28,510
Oh, that's a god you're talking to!

1827
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:31,250
Whoa!

1828
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:42,850
Okay, it's not everything is about Odin.

1829
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:43,710
Oh my god.

1830
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:44,790
Bro, calm down.

1831
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,190
Not everybody is out to get you.

1832
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,630
Okay, we go back this way.

1833
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:55,150
Thank you for the super chat!

1834
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:55,490
Thank you!

1835
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:56,270
Thank you!

1836
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:56,970
Wait.

1837
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,630
How do I get to the other side?

1838
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:00,890
Wait a minute.

1839
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:03,530
Do I have to go that way?

1840
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:03,630
Okay.

1841
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:08,210
Oh, okay.

1842
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:21,030
Can you tell Doki what happened to his last moral famine and about why Kratos is covered in ash?

1843
01:41:21,650 --> 01:41:22,450
Thank you for the super chat!

1844
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:22,750
Thank you!

1845
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:40,990
Look, when you think about Norse God, who the fuck remembers Magni?

1846
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:42,730
You stupid little boy.

1847
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:44,650
No one.

1848
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:46,890
That's why he's dead.

1849
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:55,470
We're not here to worry about the D tier gods, little boy.

1850
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,150
We're here to worry about the A gods.

1851
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:00,370
The A tier gods.

1852
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,170
The S tier gods.

1853
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:07,430
Nobody's gonna be like, oh man, my favorite god in Norse mythology was Magni.

1854
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:08,210
Magni who?

1855
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:11,530
I didn't even know Thor fucks.

1856
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,550
I didn't even know he had a kid.

1857
01:42:15,890 --> 01:42:18,210
Magni's not in Marvel Rivals exactly.

1858
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,850
Magni's my Norse.

1859
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:23,650
Oh shit.

1860
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:26,270
That's a fucking lie.

1861
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:35,230
Oh shit.

1862
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:44,550
Well, at least we know who's not the favorite son.

1863
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:48,410
Oh.

1864
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:50,850
Oh no.

1865
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,500
Oh no.

1866
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,060
Oh no.

1867
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,600
Oh

1868
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,200
no.

1869
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,080
What the fuck?

1870
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:45,780
Haven't you been teaching me to kill?

1871
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,400
Oh no.

1872
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,100
How did he just suddenly become a sociopath?

1873
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,200
Did you put your...

1874
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,560
Did you put your name in the fire?

1875
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,760
I don't understand.

1876
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,240
How did he just suddenly become a sociopath?

1877
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:43,180
He was literally...

1878
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:46,600
He was a little bitch two hours ago.

1879
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,220
What happened?

1880
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,600
What happened?

1881
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:02,980
Just suddenly being told he's a god and then he's like, now I have zero empathy.

1882
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:04,900
Holy shit.

1883
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,540
What the fuck happened to you?

1884
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,760
That's crazy.

1885
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:24,220
Literally it was just like, he had empathy like what happened?

1886
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:26,700
Like...

1887
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,560
Alright, let's get rid of these little guys.

1888
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:32,320
Like

1889
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:39,210
he couldn't even kill a fucking bear in the beginning.

1890
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:41,830
I'm pretty sure like two weeks past.

1891
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:46,710
Two weeks past since the last time since we started the game.

1892
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:48,910
There's no...

1893
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:51,030
Like what happened within two weeks?

1894
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:56,470
Star syndrome, kid.

1895
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:01,310
It's not like gods are immortal either.

1896
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,410
They grow up so fast.

1897
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:05,670
Don't they, Doki?

1898
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,690
Thank you for the super chat.

1899
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:08,070
Thank you.

1900
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:08,610
Thank you.

1901
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:16,830
I will do only what is necessary.

1902
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:17,670
And I'll help.

1903
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:18,630
No.

1904
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:22,650
Which way?

1905
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:23,330
This way.

1906
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:25,010
Plenty.

1907
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:25,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1908
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:26,230
Thank you.

1909
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:26,710
Thank you.

1910
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:31,570
I'm sending you this email to say you shouldn't collab with Arceus.

1911
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:34,830
You shouldn't interact with his content.

1912
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:37,950
He is toxic since he learned to be a god.

1913
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,310
Thank you for the super chat.

1914
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:40,790
Thank you.

1915
01:46:42,550 --> 01:46:44,150
Oh my god, maybe you're right.

1916
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:46,450
Something's changed.

1917
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:48,790
Something's fucking changed.

1918
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:02,190
Wait, a new way out?

1919
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:03,670
Oh, thank god.

1920
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:05,730
Thank god there was the yellow paint.

1921
01:47:06,130 --> 01:47:07,310
I got a little scared.

1922
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:08,810
I was like, new way?

1923
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:13,490
What do you mean new way?

1924
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:15,250
Where is the new way?

1925
01:47:16,970 --> 01:47:18,250
Wait, is he five?

1926
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:18,850
Okay, no.

1927
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:20,690
I can use this then.

1928
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:27,190
God, I love... Oh shit!

1929
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:28,350
What happened to my HP?

1930
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:30,770
Wait a minute.

1931
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:34,730
Wait, actually what happened to my HP?

1932
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:36,370
Oh shit, oh shit.

1933
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:42,770
Okay, I don't know what happened to my HP, but this is concerning.

1934
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,410
I'm about to get mad soon.

1935
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:46,450
Okay.

1936
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:48,790
Okay, don't worry.

1937
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,870
Just use your arrows, boy!

1938
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:53,470
Just use your arrows!

1939
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:57,670
That's right, do your thing!

1940
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:59,990
Please, he's one HP, boy.

1941
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:00,790
Please.

1942
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:03,030
He's actually one HP, okay.

1943
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:06,050
Oh god, I'm one HP.

1944
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:08,910
I'm one HP, please.

1945
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:12,410
Somebody drop HP right now!

1946
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,930
Oh my god, okay.

1947
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:19,490
Okay, this is bad.

1948
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:20,410
This is very bad.

1949
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:22,090
This is very, very, very bad.

1950
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:25,230
Oh god.

1951
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:26,230
Oh god.

1952
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:28,910
Oh, come on.

1953
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:30,330
There has to be...

1954
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:31,330
Come on, boy, this is it.

1955
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:32,670
This is your time to shine!

1956
01:48:33,050 --> 01:48:35,370
You're always yelling about how you're a god, dad!

1957
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:37,630
This is your time to shine, boy!

1958
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,470
Okay, nice, nice.

1959
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:41,570
He's almost dead.

1960
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:43,250
This is it.

1961
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:46,770
I just need you to do the thing.

1962
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:49,770
I just need you to do the thing.

1963
01:48:52,590 --> 01:48:53,190
Alright.

1964
01:48:54,090 --> 01:48:55,830
I forgot I can do this.

1965
01:48:57,930 --> 01:48:58,270
Alright.

1966
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:00,450
Please, boy.

1967
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:02,150
Use your arrows.

1968
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,610
Boy, use your arrows!

1969
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:06,770
Why aren't you shooting your arrows?!

1970
01:49:07,690 --> 01:49:09,270
Oh my god!

1971
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:12,790
Okay, there we go.

1972
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:14,270
There we go.

1973
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:18,950
He doesn't shoot his arrows!

1974
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:20,590
I don't know what's going on!

1975
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:22,310
He's so scared!

1976
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:23,870
He's just looking!

1977
01:49:25,010 --> 01:49:26,610
Like, what is he doing?!

1978
01:49:31,650 --> 01:49:32,730
What?!

1979
01:49:32,730 --> 01:49:36,610
That was on purpose?!

1980
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,260
Boy!

1981
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:45,900
Boy!

1982
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,180
I will slap you!

1983
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,340
I will fucking...

1984
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:54,380
I will fucking slap you, you little shit!

1985
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,640
Oh my god!

1986
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,180
I thought...

1987
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,600
I legitimately thought...

1988
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:09,220
I thought it was my game bugging out, but he was actually being a little fucking shit!

1989
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,300
Oh my god!

1990
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,920
Bro thinks he's high, elo.

1991
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,840
Bro thinks he's high, elo.

1992
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:24,660
Oh my god!

1993
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:24,900
Oh my god!

1994
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,620
I'm gonna slap this boy!

1995
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:32,530
In-game, guys.

1996
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:33,210
In-game.

1997
01:50:33,290 --> 01:50:39,690
I do not endorse slapping, but like, some boys deserve it!

1998
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:46,870
It should be fire, right?

1999
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:47,090
Yeah.

2000
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:53,610
I'm getting my belt of chaos.

2001
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,490
I'm getting it, elo.

2002
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:57,710
This is what it's for now.

2003
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:05,270
Where are the health gems?

2004
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:16,110
I told you to shoot the guy, but you didn't shoot him.

2005
01:51:16,290 --> 01:51:16,990
What do you mean?

2006
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,730
What do you mean you did everything?

2007
01:51:18,950 --> 01:51:21,190
I gave you one and I said shoot!

2008
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:22,350
Shoot the arrows!

2009
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:29,090
You used the blades to kill one.

2010
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:34,530
Who else did you kill before Magma?

2011
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,290
Do you see me happy?

2012
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:39,410
Can you not tell I'm fucking depressed, boy?

2013
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:41,290
Have you ever seen me smile?

2014
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:43,350
Have you seen me smile?

2015
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:46,890
Fine.

2016
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:49,170
Come here.

2017
01:51:49,830 --> 01:51:50,430
Guess what?

2018
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:52,870
I know everything I need to know now.

2019
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:55,170
I have nothing left to learn.

2020
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:56,470
Oh.

2021
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:00,510
Oh.

2022
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:02,490
Oh my god.

2023
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:05,090
Why did I listen to a witch?

2024
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:07,390
That's why you should never listen to witches.

2025
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:08,530
Never.

2026
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:09,750
Nothing ever comes good.

2027
01:52:09,870 --> 01:52:11,390
We should've just burned all witches.

2028
01:52:11,990 --> 01:52:13,730
This is why we burn witches, boy.

2029
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:17,150
Nothing ever good comes from listening to one of them.

2030
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:21,630
Should've just let him die.

2031
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:22,770
I could make another boy.

2032
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:24,630
Oh no.

2033
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:26,710
Oh no.

2034
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:29,850
I can't.

2035
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:30,630
I'm too scared.

2036
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:32,630
I am- oh, thank god.

2037
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:32,910
Okay.

2038
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:34,550
Oh, thank god.

2039
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:36,190
Okay, I had to use the rage.

2040
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:37,850
I got scared.

2041
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:40,290
I legitimately- oh my god.

2042
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:41,850
I'm gonna punch you out from the sky.

2043
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:48,820
Oh shit, this is not what I want.

2044
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,400
I had to use the rage.

2045
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,580
I was worried I was gonna fucking die from lack of HP.

2046
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:01,740
Oh, now you're gonna help out, huh?

2047
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,780
Now you wanna help?

2048
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:06,860
Fucking right.

2049
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:18,740
He's dead.

2050
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,860
That's how it goes.

2051
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:28,020
Okay, let's...

2052
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:28,320
Yo!

2053
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:29,560
Pew!

2054
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:30,660
Pew!

2055
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,320
Alright, and then...

2056
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:35,560
We do this...

2057
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:37,680
and...

2058
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:38,540
Wind!

2059
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,860
What did that do?

2060
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:42,680
Nothing.

2061
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:43,760
Alright, cool.

2062
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:47,700
You know, I felt like it would've done more.

2063
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:50,280
What the fuck did that do?

2064
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:53,280
Did it not do anything?

2065
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,640
I love nothing!

2066
01:53:58,460 --> 01:53:59,780
Oh boy, what's up there?

2067
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:07,450
Oh, okay.

2068
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:09,470
Went up.

2069
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,450
See, there's money here.

2070
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:14,970
Is there anything upstairs?

2071
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:20,620
Hello?

2072
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:23,720
Anything up here?

2073
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:25,880
I shouldn't waste those.

2074
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,760
I feel like I'm always begging for heals.

2075
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:30,420
Read, boy!

2076
01:54:30,420 --> 01:54:30,800
Okay.

2077
01:54:33,890 --> 01:54:36,510
You're the one thing your power has.

2078
01:54:41,530 --> 01:54:42,150
This?

2079
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:48,090
Did I wake him?

2080
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:48,490
Oh.

2081
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:51,390
Oh, I could've saved that.

2082
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:53,150
I could've saved that.

2083
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:53,770
Oh my...

2084
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:54,870
Fucking Chorus!

2085
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:56,490
Oh my God, guys!

2086
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:59,410
Guess what else we have to fucking fight?

2087
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:01,150
A goddamn troll!

2088
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:03,830
Oh my God!

2089
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:04,350
Wow!

2090
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:07,590
I'm so surprised it's another troll!

2091
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:08,810
It's a...

2092
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:11,270
It's a fucking troll!

2093
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:12,090
Wow!

2094
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:13,810
Wow!

2095
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:19,270
Oh my God!

2096
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:20,350
I fucking knew it!

2097
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:23,890
Oh my God!

2098
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:24,550
Wow!

2099
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:26,250
Who would've thought?

2100
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:28,970
I'm gonna fight another fucking troll!

2101
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:31,690
Who would've fucking thought?

2102
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:33,810
Oh shit, I might die from this troll, though.

2103
01:55:35,190 --> 01:55:35,950
Oh no.

2104
01:55:37,150 --> 01:55:37,690
Oh no.

2105
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:38,270
No, no, no!

2106
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:39,030
Why am I using this?

2107
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:42,230
Bye.

2108
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:43,190
Goodbye.

2109
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:49,350
Alright.

2110
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:55,100
Oh my God, from 1 HP to 0 I'm so fucked.

2111
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:56,980
Fuck.

2112
01:55:58,180 --> 01:55:58,640
Fuck.

2113
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:02,380
Please, he's 1 HP!

2114
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:04,180
He's 1 HP!

2115
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,300
Nice.

2116
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:10,920
Goodbye, troll!

2117
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,220
Oh my God!

2118
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:16,700
I might die from a fucking minion at this point, though.

2119
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:22,100
Okay, there is a high chance I might die to a minion.

2120
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:23,560
Oh no, no, no!

2121
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:23,800
No!

2122
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:31,200
Oh my God, do I at least get...

2123
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,660
Do I at least get the troll kill?

2124
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,300
Are you seri...

2125
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,860
Oh, I did!

2126
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,120
I don't get the items from the troll?!

2127
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,620
Oh my God.

2128
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,920
I don't even get the items.

2129
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:52,420
I don't even get the special items from the troll!

2130
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,180
I actually got the 9!

2131
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:58,100
Oh my God, it's so bullshit.

2132
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:02,220
Oh, I hope it's not something important.

2133
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:06,220
I hope it's not something important, guys.

2134
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:12,310
What do I do with this?

2135
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:16,710
Like, can I pick it up?

2136
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:18,730
What?

2137
01:57:22,670 --> 01:57:24,130
What do I do?

2138
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:34,140
Oh, if it doesn't have the win, I can pick it up?

2139
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:35,620
Oh, okay.

2140
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:36,780
I didn't know that.

2141
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,820
Alright, I'll just transfer the win here then.

2142
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:45,600
Alright.

2143
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:55,420
I feel like...

2144
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,960
Can I transfer it?

2145
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:01,560
Wait, how do I drop it?

2146
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,300
Wait, how do I drop it?

2147
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,920
Wait a minute, how do I drop...

2148
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,960
Wait a minute, how do I drop this thing?

2149
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:19,640
Um...

2150
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:20,640
Oh, it's circle.

2151
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:21,120
Okay.

2152
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:24,860
It didn't tell me how, so I got really confused.

2153
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,720
Do I put it here?

2154
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:41,020
And then, I guess I put it here.

2155
01:58:46,770 --> 01:58:48,790
And can I do it from here?

2156
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:50,990
Is it too far?

2157
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:53,090
No, right?

2158
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:54,270
It shouldn't be too far, right?

2159
01:58:54,410 --> 01:58:57,130
Alright, there we go.

2160
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:58,110
Yay!

2161
01:58:59,230 --> 01:58:59,750
Puzzles!

2162
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:03,910
Nice, we did it.

2163
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:06,270
Easy.

2164
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:09,990
Easiest puzzles in my fucking life.

2165
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:11,730
What did I get?

2166
01:59:12,690 --> 01:59:14,130
Heavy runic attack.

2167
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:21,080
Burn, stun...

2168
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:24,980
Uh...

2169
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:25,860
Fuck it.

2170
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:27,120
More burn is nice.

2171
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:29,800
Alright, let's go.

2172
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,040
Let's go, boy.

2173
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:34,920
Yay!

2174
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,880
I'm so smart, guys.

2175
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:43,240
It's not like it took me a while to figure that out.

2176
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:48,700
Oh.

2177
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:49,800
Alright, cool.

2178
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:55,800
What am I supposed to do?

2179
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:57,240
Am I supposed to hurt people?

2180
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:01,180
What if I just pull you in?

2181
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:04,660
Get over here.

2182
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:06,620
Oh, that's actually sick.

2183
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:08,640
Wow.

2184
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:09,940
Okay.

2185
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,920
Alright, Mr. Fucking Smartass.

2186
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,540
That was cool.

2187
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:17,960
Boy.

2188
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,140
That was fucking cool.

2189
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:21,760
Alright.

2190
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,000
Alright.

2191
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:25,760
Give your old man some goddamn credit.

2192
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:32,860
What does it say?

2193
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:33,640
Read, boy.

2194
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:39,770
Find a location from the scrolls?

2195
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,580
A sequel is mine.

2196
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,380
I shall one day...

2197
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:48,940
Maybe one day I'll find that.

2198
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:50,960
One day.

2199
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:56,960
Damien, thank you for the super chat.

2200
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:58,140
Thank you, thank you.

2201
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:01,340
Artreus is peak motherless behavior.

2202
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,400
Yeah, he definitely has mommy issues right now.

2203
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,180
But it's like hitting him hard right now.

2204
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:08,240
What?

2205
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:12,920
I...

2206
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:14,780
Okay.

2207
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:19,780
Wow.

2208
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,400
Guess who has to deal with that shit?

2209
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,380
Okay.

2210
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:26,200
Okay.

2211
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:28,820
Okay, boy.

2212
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,180
Okay, I've been...

2213
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:31,580
Alright.

2214
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:35,520
Fuck me, I guess.

2215
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:38,900
What the fuck?

2216
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:43,250
Oh, god.

2217
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:45,190
Oh, I missed.

2218
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:46,370
I missed.

2219
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:52,110
I forgot...

2220
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:55,880
Please!

2221
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,500
No!

2222
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,020
Oh, my god.

2223
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,540
Why is it hitting?!

2224
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,940
Oh, no.

2225
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,500
Oh, no.

2226
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:12,740
It's not hitting, guys.

2227
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:17,740
I... I can't.

2228
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,100
I can't.

2229
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:20,280
I can't.

2230
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:20,700
I...

2231
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:22,880
I need to put my son up for adoption.

2232
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:23,840
I...

2233
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,880
I'm not okay.

2234
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:29,580
I need...

2235
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:31,520
I can't.

2236
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,940
Guys, does everyone...

2237
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:36,040
One little guy up for sale, guys.

2238
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,500
Would anyone like to adopt him?

2239
02:02:39,160 --> 02:02:41,360
Please, I need a...

2240
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:42,540
Oh, my god.

2241
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:44,060
I thought I had my axe up.

2242
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,060
Alright.

2243
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,100
Open your mouth.

2244
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:51,860
What?

2245
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:54,680
Why is it not working?

2246
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:57,800
What?

2247
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:00,600
It's not working!

2248
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:04,580
Why isn't it working?!

2249
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:07,060
What?!

2250
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:08,960
What am I doing wrong?

2251
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:14,700
I don't understand.

2252
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,780
Just... Just step on me.

2253
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:17,860
Just...

2254
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:30,660
Alright.

2255
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,180
Where is my axe?

2256
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:40,790
Where is it?

2257
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:43,670
Oh, I see orbs!

2258
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:44,210
I see orbs!

2259
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:44,830
I see orbs!

2260
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:48,050
There we go!

2261
02:03:49,870 --> 02:03:51,850
No, where's my axe?!

2262
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:59,340
I was like, where's my axe?

2263
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:00,660
Where is it?

2264
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:02,280
What happened?

2265
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:06,500
Oh, my god.

2266
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,000
It like disappeared.

2267
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,520
I was trying to find it.

2268
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:12,260
I was trying to find...

2269
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:16,060
I was trying to find my axe.

2270
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,400
You don't understand.

2271
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:20,760
No, are you serious?!

2272
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:24,860
Are you fucking kidding me?

2273
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:26,760
You used it twice?!

2274
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:28,780
Come on.

2275
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:31,540
Oh, my god.

2276
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,700
I dodged the wrong way.

2277
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:36,740
I hate you.

2278
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:38,520
I hate you so much.

2279
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:39,700
Oh, my god.

2280
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:40,360
I hate you.

2281
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:42,340
I hate you.

2282
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:44,440
No, I dodged the wrong way!

2283
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:45,380
I dodged...

2284
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:51,920
I can't believe it.

2285
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:54,140
How did I do it twice?!

2286
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:59,580
I can't believe I dodged it.

2287
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:03,880
Oh, god.

2288
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:04,880
Oh, god.

2289
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:05,700
You deserve that.

2290
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:08,100
You fucking deserve that, Arteus.

2291
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:13,700
No!

2292
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:14,560
No, I didn't mean to!

2293
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:17,840
Oh, my god, I didn't mean to!

2294
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:20,420
Okay, I'm not angry anymore.

2295
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:26,720
No, are you serious?!

2296
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:31,320
Okay, yeah, guys.

2297
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:32,880
I don't need type advantage.

2298
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,360
Okay, maybe I do.

2299
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,420
Maybe I do.

2300
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:39,800
I hate my son.

2301
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:42,760
I hate my son so much.

2302
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,160
Guys, I hate him.

2303
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:49,740
What was I hate my son?

2304
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,430
Wait, I can't...

2305
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:54,220
Wait a minute.

2306
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:55,920
I can't use the chaos.

2307
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:03,120
Oh, you can't use it.

2308
02:06:03,140 --> 02:06:04,060
I thought you can.

2309
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,260
It's fine.

2310
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,360
We don't need type advantage.

2311
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,100
Type advantage is for losers.

2312
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:11,430
Is this Pokemon?!

2313
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:13,780
This isn't Pokemon?!

2314
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:16,460
I'm here to be a fucking man!

2315
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:22,380
This is not here for pussy!

2316
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:23,260
Oh, shit.

2317
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:23,980
I'm sorry.

2318
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,740
Hurry up.

2319
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:29,260
Really?!

2320
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:31,080
Really?!

2321
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:33,840
Oh, no.

2322
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:34,320
Oh, no.

2323
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:34,400
Oh, no.

2324
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:38,880
Okay, look at me.

2325
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:39,400
Look at me.

2326
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:40,460
Look at me!

2327
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:43,360
Look at me!

2328
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:45,180
I might be dead.

2329
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:45,720
I might be dead.

2330
02:06:45,980 --> 02:06:46,620
There's no way.

2331
02:06:47,380 --> 02:06:48,080
I might be dead.

2332
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:49,860
Oh,

2333
02:06:59,510 --> 02:06:59,690
my God.

2334
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:00,290
I have a shield.

2335
02:07:00,770 --> 02:07:01,410
Oh, my God.

2336
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:02,610
I could block the rain.

2337
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:05,570
Guys, I remembered I had a shield.

2338
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:07,470
Okay, we got...

2339
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:09,690
Every...

2340
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:12,310
It only takes me a couple hours to remember I have a shield.

2341
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:15,310
It takes one boss to make me remember my shield.

2342
02:07:20,210 --> 02:07:21,470
There we go.

2343
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:22,990
There we go.

2344
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:28,150
Guys, I remember I had...

2345
02:07:28,150 --> 02:07:30,850
Now, this fight seems a lot easier now.

2346
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:31,870
Now, this fight seems a lot easier now.

2347
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:34,570
It only takes me, like, a couple hours to remember the shield.

2348
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:40,910
Guys, I have to fight another fucking troll, guys.

2349
02:07:44,390 --> 02:07:45,150
Okay.

2350
02:07:46,850 --> 02:07:47,610
Troll...

2351
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:49,110
It's different when it's a troll.

2352
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,710
It's so different.

2353
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:55,350
Oh, my God.

2354
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:57,370
I hate that attack so much.

2355
02:07:58,490 --> 02:07:59,090
It's actually...

2356
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:00,110
It's so cringe!

2357
02:08:04,350 --> 02:08:06,190
It's actually so cringe!

2358
02:08:09,770 --> 02:08:11,410
Oh, my God.

2359
02:08:13,110 --> 02:08:15,990
Oh, my God.

2360
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:16,650
There we go.

2361
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:21,460
There we go.

2362
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:23,820
What?!

2363
02:08:23,820 --> 02:08:25,640
There we go.

2364
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:30,980
There we go.

2365
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,060
Ugh!

2366
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:35,580
Get down!

2367
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:36,360
Get down!

2368
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,300
Get down!

2369
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:38,020
Get down!

2370
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:38,180
Get down!

2371
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,020
No one loves you!

2372
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:39,900
Your mom hates you!

2373
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,220
You're abandoned as a child!

2374
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:46,310
Alright, nice.

2375
02:08:48,110 --> 02:08:49,150
Alright, we gotta wait.

2376
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:51,890
Nice.

2377
02:08:56,430 --> 02:08:58,330
I hate that move so much.

2378
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:00,310
There we go.

2379
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:03,630
He should die now.

2380
02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:04,630
See, I told you guys.

2381
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:06,010
We don't need type advantage.

2382
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:09,090
She's going in!

2383
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:10,950
Alright.

2384
02:09:11,270 --> 02:09:12,590
Rare enchantment.

2385
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:14,450
Get this.

2386
02:09:14,530 --> 02:09:15,110
Get this.

2387
02:09:15,210 --> 02:09:15,790
Get this.

2388
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:16,370
Get this.

2389
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:16,670
Alright.

2390
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,950
The rare moments where I remember I have a shield.

2391
02:09:23,190 --> 02:09:25,030
It only takes one boss fight.

2392
02:09:27,290 --> 02:09:29,850
It makes a lot more sense.

2393
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:33,690
The boy was actually useless during that entire fight.

2394
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:36,990
This is outrageous.

2395
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:38,330
It was unfair.

2396
02:09:38,730 --> 02:09:42,490
I was expecting my rivals.

2397
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:44,770
Thank you for the super chat.

2398
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:45,130
Thank you.

2399
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,330
Should be full HP now.

2400
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:59,970
Like, he did nothing during that entire fight.

2401
02:10:01,090 --> 02:10:04,050
Your existence was actually meaningless.

2402
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:07,790
Alright.

2403
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:10,690
Gotta get this.

2404
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:16,960
Get over here.

2405
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:19,280
You're the one thing you're good at.

2406
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:24,890
Like, he didn't even...

2407
02:10:24,890 --> 02:10:26,070
I had to kill him.

2408
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:30,320
I had to fucking kill him.

2409
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:31,220
What did he do?

2410
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:34,520
He just watched me with his little bow that did zero damage.

2411
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:37,640
I invested in your bow college.

2412
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,960
I expected results.

2413
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,200
Alright, nice.

2414
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,140
I got a new... Oh, whoops.

2415
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:45,340
I should put that on.

2416
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:46,280
Actually.

2417
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:49,280
Where is it?

2418
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:50,860
No, that's the tunic.

2419
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,160
Oh, it was this one.

2420
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:53,380
Nice.

2421
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,000
Oh, I can add sockets to it.

2422
02:10:58,100 --> 02:10:59,220
Add damage.

2423
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:00,860
Oh, okay.

2424
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,800
Increase damage of all astros by 6%.

2425
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,780
Stacks up to 18%.

2426
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:08,960
Um...

2427
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:10,860
Okay, let's get this one instead.

2428
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:12,520
Do I have runics for other stuff?

2429
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,160
Oh, I do!

2430
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,780
Might as well, right?

2431
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,980
Sometimes I use the astros.

2432
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:23,960
And it's purple!

2433
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:25,360
That means it's good.

2434
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:30,340
Alright, we go this way.

2435
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,080
Um...

2436
02:11:42,730 --> 02:11:43,410
What?

2437
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:46,310
What did you say to me, boy?

2438
02:11:47,010 --> 02:11:48,130
Pick it up.

2439
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:50,310
Pick it up!

2440
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,530
That's right, don't you whatever me.

2441
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:54,370
That's fucking right.

2442
02:11:55,890 --> 02:11:58,210
Don't you fucking whatever me, boy.

2443
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,050
Why is boy a sociopath?

2444
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:05,070
Continues the verbal abuse.

2445
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,990
It's making him stronger!

2446
02:12:10,570 --> 02:12:13,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2447
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:14,330
Oh,

2448
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:22,180
nice.

2449
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:22,900
Okay.

2450
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,500
Oh, I keep forgetting to put square instead.

2451
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,960
Um, does this cover up?

2452
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:32,440
Why are the better armors covering up the nipples?

2453
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:36,860
They should be running free!

2454
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:39,660
Oh, hey, there's a dwarf.

2455
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:46,220
Oh, do I have any upgrades?

2456
02:12:51,220 --> 02:12:53,320
Guess that's it, right?

2457
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:55,260
Oh, I could upgrade.

2458
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:58,040
Wait, you guys were saying one of my, uh...

2459
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:02,060
One of my attacks is really strong.

2460
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,160
We only have axe attacks, though.

2461
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:12,080
I thought I had one for the chaos.

2462
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:14,660
Oh, no.

2463
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:15,800
I don't remember.

2464
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:16,860
It was the... yeah.

2465
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:27,560
What is it?

2466
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:32,700
Can I upgrade my runic?

2467
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:36,540
I don't remember.

2468
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:44,260
Oh, it's through the skill menu.

2469
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:46,020
Oh, okay.

2470
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:48,060
What's in here?

2471
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:49,380
Whoa!

2472
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:49,500
Whoa!

2473
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:53,860
Oh, shit!

2474
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:54,800
Oh, my god.

2475
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:55,040
Okay.

2476
02:13:55,540 --> 02:13:56,900
Okay, that's what's in here.

2477
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:57,820
Okay.

2478
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:00,140
Oh, my god.

2479
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,380
Okay, it's time to be angry.

2480
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:05,080
Sometimes they're not bad things, okay?

2481
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:07,240
Sometimes when you... oh, wait.

2482
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:08,760
That guy is level seven.

2483
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:09,560
He's purple.

2484
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:10,420
I'm a little...

2485
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:12,140
I'm a little worried, guys.

2486
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:12,880
He's purple.

2487
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:14,320
Wait, he's dead.

2488
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:15,640
Wait, what?

2489
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,800
Wait, what is hitting me?

2490
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:23,120
Oh, it's these guys.

2491
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:26,620
Oh, no.

2492
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,360
Okay, this is a little bad.

2493
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:30,960
I'm getting frozen, guys.

2494
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:33,080
Oh, fuck off!

2495
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:33,640
No!

2496
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:36,440
Oh, no.

2497
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,420
Guys, I'm a little...

2498
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:40,380
Okay, it's fine.

2499
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:42,740
It's fine.

2500
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:44,660
Boy can do it.

2501
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:47,840
It's fine.

2502
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:50,180
Just keep locking, boy.

2503
02:14:52,060 --> 02:14:54,280
It's fine, just keep...

2504
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:57,460
It's fine.

2505
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,800
Just keep locking.

2506
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:01,780
You got this, boy.

2507
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,100
Here we go.

2508
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:07,000
Here we go.

2509
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:09,120
This is investment.

2510
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:10,600
Oh, nice.

2511
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:12,160
We did it.

2512
02:15:12,580 --> 02:15:14,640
Watch him stop attacking me.

2513
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,900
Oh, so easy.

2514
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:18,760
Nice.

2515
02:15:20,980 --> 02:15:22,920
Wait, there's more to the hole?

2516
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,400
Oh, I don't feel so good, though.

2517
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,180
I absolutely do not feel so good.

2518
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:34,960
Nice.

2519
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:38,480
I unlocked the realm of Nifflim.

2520
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:40,500
Now, is this a good hole?

2521
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:43,680
Yay!

2522
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:45,320
It turned into a good hole!

2523
02:15:46,820 --> 02:15:47,500
Alright.

2524
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:49,560
Good hole!

2525
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:51,920
Yippee!

2526
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:56,160
Don't you love it when the holes turn out to be good?

2527
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:00,740
Just gotta get rid of the bad stuff first.

2528
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:04,240
Okay.

2529
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:06,680
I'm gonna burn this.

2530
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:10,120
Up I go.

2531
02:16:11,060 --> 02:16:12,640
Up I go.

2532
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,950
Alright.

2533
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:21,950
Up I go again.

2534
02:16:32,390 --> 02:16:33,070
Aww.

2535
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:34,970
Respect your elders, boy!

2536
02:16:37,470 --> 02:16:39,170
What if I go the other way?

2537
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:40,430
What's up here?

2538
02:16:43,050 --> 02:16:43,730
Whoa.

2539
02:16:43,730 --> 02:16:46,730
Guys, my boy isn't respecting elders anymore.

2540
02:16:47,930 --> 02:16:49,330
What is over here?

2541
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:51,350
Have I been here before?

2542
02:16:54,210 --> 02:16:55,470
I must have.

2543
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:56,970
This must be like a shortcut.

2544
02:16:59,550 --> 02:17:02,030
Boy, don't make me burn out the belt!

2545
02:17:04,450 --> 02:17:05,030
Alright,

2546
02:17:08,250 --> 02:17:09,150
we go this way.

2547
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,500
Oh, this is where...

2548
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,660
Oh, we can make the portal now!

2549
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:18,820
We have the gem for it.

2550
02:17:22,990 --> 02:17:24,530
Alright, we have fast travel too.

2551
02:17:24,890 --> 02:17:25,010
Pew!

2552
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:26,710
Pew!

2553
02:17:28,310 --> 02:17:29,870
Alright, now we can just walk up.

2554
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:33,690
Hey boy, I thought you were a god!

2555
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:37,390
Why don't you climb this yourself if you're so fucking strong?

2556
02:17:37,970 --> 02:17:39,930
That's right, you can because you're a little bitch.

2557
02:17:43,490 --> 02:17:45,150
Boy, put it in!

2558
02:17:52,710 --> 02:17:54,030
Why is it with blood?

2559
02:17:54,350 --> 02:17:55,770
I thought it was a rock.

2560
02:17:57,150 --> 02:17:59,310
Boy, where the fuck did you get my blood from?

2561
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:02,930
Wait, you wrote that in blood?

2562
02:18:05,230 --> 02:18:06,630
Oh my god!

2563
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:07,750
Boy, okay.

2564
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:12,150
Okay.

2565
02:18:13,110 --> 02:18:14,230
I'm a little worried.

2566
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:16,370
Boy has blood on him now.

2567
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:19,070
Boy started writing things in blood now, guys.

2568
02:18:19,110 --> 02:18:20,030
I'm a little worried.

2569
02:18:20,890 --> 02:18:21,370
What?

2570
02:18:27,710 --> 02:18:29,330
Oh, there it is.

2571
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:35,090
There's more?

2572
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:37,210
Pew!

2573
02:18:40,550 --> 02:18:41,270
Pew!

2574
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:58,560
Oh my gosh!

2575
02:18:58,560 --> 02:18:59,460
Boy, that's cool.

2576
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,660
A bridge appeared.

2577
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:06,500
Huh?

2578
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:09,300
Oh, she's bolder!

2579
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:11,400
Are you

2580
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:18,590
kidding me?

2581
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:31,030
Nothing has changed since learning that you're a god, boy.

2582
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:32,750
You're literally the same guy.

2583
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:39,590
Oh my god!

2584
02:19:57,230 --> 02:19:59,490
He's now way more unlikeable.

2585
02:19:59,910 --> 02:20:00,630
That's true.

2586
02:20:13,410 --> 02:20:17,480
Get out of here, boy.

2587
02:20:31,540 --> 02:20:33,420
Oh no,

2588
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:37,140
he's getting angry.

2589
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:39,740
What?!

2590
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:48,160
Okay!

2591
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:51,500
At least, like...

2592
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:54,520
At least, like, he was born out of love.

2593
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:57,700
Your mom did not love your dad.

2594
02:20:58,520 --> 02:20:59,200
Oh, shit!

2595
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:02,480
Like, what was the plan, Artreus?

2596
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,480
You shot me?!

2597
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:04,760
What?

2598
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,260
I shouldn't even save him.

2599
02:21:14,410 --> 02:21:15,430
The fuck?

2600
02:21:15,650 --> 02:21:17,050
Where did this dragon come from?

2601
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:20,590
Whose dragon is this?

2602
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:21,830
Is yours?

2603
02:21:26,270 --> 02:21:28,270
Oh, shit!

2604
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:36,590
Oh, that boy's got a...

2605
02:21:39,430 --> 02:21:40,330
That's fucking right.

2606
02:21:40,570 --> 02:21:41,490
Get out of here!

2607
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:43,050
Oh, the eye can...

2608
02:21:43,050 --> 02:21:43,830
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

2609
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:47,530
I shouldn't say that.

2610
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:48,370
I'm sorry.

2611
02:21:48,490 --> 02:21:49,950
I got way too...

2612
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:51,270
I got way too Kratos there.

2613
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:55,830
I didn't say it, guys!

2614
02:21:56,390 --> 02:21:57,510
I... Sorry.

2615
02:21:57,970 --> 02:21:58,810
My... I...

2616
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:01,250
I got way too immersive, guys.

2617
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:03,010
Sorry.

2618
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:05,210
I wonder where he's gonna hit me.

2619
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:05,970
Whoa!

2620
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:09,270
I wonder where he's gonna hit me, guys!

2621
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:20,350
Oh, shit.

2622
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:21,630
This guy went...

2623
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:23,450
Alright, don't worry.

2624
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:25,130
There we go.

2625
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:26,310
Me first!

2626
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:27,330
Me first!

2627
02:22:29,530 --> 02:22:30,050
Alright.

2628
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:31,810
Oh, shit!

2629
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:32,070
Okay.

2630
02:22:33,050 --> 02:22:34,910
I need to remember the timing.

2631
02:22:36,430 --> 02:22:38,030
Guys, this is such a...

2632
02:22:38,030 --> 02:22:39,390
...dumb fight, I'm gonna say it.

2633
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:47,510
This fight is so fucking stupid.

2634
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:22,350
Alright, get out of here, get out of here.

2635
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:25,610
Oh my god, you're just gonna be fainted there?

2636
02:23:26,010 --> 02:23:28,710
Bro, he hit you once and you're just gonna be...

2637
02:23:28,710 --> 02:23:30,610
You're just gonna be knocked out.

2638
02:23:31,090 --> 02:23:33,070
Yeah, I'm fucking god my ass.

2639
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:39,250
I literally took a giant... I'm taking a down fist right now on my face.

2640
02:23:39,350 --> 02:23:42,030
But you get hit one time, Artaeus.

2641
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:44,290
One fucking time!

2642
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:48,850
I got stabbed too!

2643
02:23:52,330 --> 02:23:53,990
Oh, this poor dragon.

2644
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:56,970
Oh, that's... Is the dragon okay?

2645
02:24:06,610 --> 02:24:08,790
That's how physics work, guys.

2646
02:24:11,530 --> 02:24:14,230
Oh no, not the dragon!

2647
02:24:14,230 --> 02:24:14,650
Dragon!

2648
02:24:16,850 --> 02:24:17,610
No!

2649
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:20,650
Oh my god, I hope the dragon's okay.

2650
02:24:21,150 --> 02:24:23,350
Oh yeah, I have a son too, but...

2651
02:24:23,350 --> 02:24:23,970
Hey, frog.

2652
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:27,830
Parried the earth.

2653
02:24:34,250 --> 02:24:37,880
Is the dragon okay?

2654
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,800
Is he okay?

2655
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:48,860
The full weight of Asgard will come crashing down on you.

2656
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,860
It's over.

2657
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:03,480
So be it.

2658
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:04,960
Oh shit!

2659
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:06,340
What do I do?

2660
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:11,760
Baldur!

2661
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:12,140
No!

2662
02:25:12,980 --> 02:25:13,840
Listen to me!

2663
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:19,680
What

2664
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:26,500
do I do?

2665
02:25:34,100 --> 02:25:35,560
Am I in Helheim?

2666
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:38,420
I'm back in Helheim.

2667
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:45,410
Even in Hell, I'll still beat your ass.

2668
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:50,590
So you'll die here, and then I'll beat your ass again.

2669
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:00,620
I will battle you in Hell.

2670
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:00,940
What?

2671
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,240
I'm here.

2672
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:06,300
I like how he sounded so okay.

2673
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:08,100
I'm here, dad.

2674
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:09,680
Here I am.

2675
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,360
You literally just survived the fall.

2676
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,200
Listen to me and not speak a word.

2677
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,100
I am your father, and you boy are not yourself.

2678
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:20,940
You are too quick to temper.

2679
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:24,180
You are rash, insubordinate, and out of control.

2680
02:26:24,180 --> 02:26:26,560
This will not stand.

2681
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:30,960
You will honor your mother and abandon this path you have chosen.

2682
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:33,980
It is not too late.

2683
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:36,360
You're still a young boy.

2684
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:39,600
I shall teach you how to be a pussy again.

2685
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:42,200
We are here because of you, boy.

2686
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:45,100
Never forget that.

2687
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,280
Yeah?

2688
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:55,380
You're gonna listen to me now?

2689
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:56,320
Yeah?

2690
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:59,560
Oh yeah, round two.

2691
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:02,120
Oh, rescued him yet again.

2692
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:04,940
Alright.

2693
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,080
We go this way.

2694
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:15,680
Wait, there's a worse...

2695
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,560
Why is there a worse place than Hell?

2696
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:23,640
Wait, what part of Hell is this?

2697
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:32,260
Oh.

2698
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:32,560
Oh shit.

2699
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:33,680
I didn't see him.

2700
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:37,320
Alright, let me go this...

2701
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:39,520
Wait, how do I...

2702
02:27:40,580 --> 02:27:40,860
Alright.

2703
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:45,160
How do I get... Oh, there we go.

2704
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:46,440
How do I get to the other side?

2705
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:47,080
Oh, there we go.

2706
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:48,820
Alright, get out of here.

2707
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:50,620
That's fucking right.

2708
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:52,580
Get down!

2709
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:57,040
Boy.

2710
02:27:58,420 --> 02:27:59,480
What?

2711
02:28:02,930 --> 02:28:03,820
What do you mean?

2712
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:06,940
Wait.

2713
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:10,160
Am I listening to your inner thoughts right now?

2714
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:18,680
Is that your...

2715
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:20,340
Intrusive thoughts?

2716
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:22,840
Boop.

2717
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:24,900
Oh, fuck it.

2718
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:27,280
Boop.

2719
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,380
Alright, come on.

2720
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:31,160
Stop.

2721
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:31,800
Woah!

2722
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:32,680
Woah!

2723
02:28:34,770 --> 02:28:35,730
Where's the third party?

2724
02:28:37,230 --> 02:28:38,830
There was only two guys in front of me.

2725
02:28:39,030 --> 02:28:40,530
There was a third guy too?

2726
02:28:44,070 --> 02:28:47,030
Okay, I did not realize I had the fucking aim, I guess.

2727
02:28:48,590 --> 02:28:49,950
Wait, what the fuck?

2728
02:28:49,970 --> 02:28:50,870
He made his own shield.

2729
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,280
Okay, we gotta kill this one guy.

2730
02:28:58,900 --> 02:28:59,980
Alright, I did it.

2731
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:04,360
Wait, how do I open this?

2732
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:05,220
Oh.

2733
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,700
Nice.

2734
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:16,620
Huh?

2735
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:24,440
Oh, this is when I killed that one guy.

2736
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:33,730
Happy memories.

2737
02:29:41,330 --> 02:29:43,270
Oh no, it's like...

2738
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:44,990
Jekyll and Hyde.

2739
02:29:46,330 --> 02:29:49,070
That's his god side coming out.

2740
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:51,690
So nostalgic, guys.

2741
02:29:51,950 --> 02:29:55,630
It's like it didn't- It's not like it happened like a couple of hours ago, boy.

2742
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:01,360
That nostalgia is hitting hard.

2743
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:06,940
That there are two wolves inside.

2744
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:20,540
LOL Look,

2745
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:32,040
that was 20 minutes of me.

2746
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:33,600
That's different.

2747
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:37,700
20 minutes of me was so different.

2748
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:47,040
Okay, I got one on the sides.

2749
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:50,000
But, where's the other flame?

2750
02:30:53,800 --> 02:30:54,140
Huh?

2751
02:30:59,820 --> 02:31:00,540
Huh.

2752
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:00,660
Huh.

2753
02:31:03,380 --> 02:31:05,380
Wait, I can only do one side.

2754
02:31:07,560 --> 02:31:08,020
Oh!

2755
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,780
Okay.

2756
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:11,780
JK.

2757
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:15,200
Alright.

2758
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:19,920
I didn't see the other gear.

2759
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:21,300
Open!

2760
02:31:24,700 --> 02:31:26,320
At least it's not a troll.

2761
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:28,180
You know what the fuck is with those things.

2762
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:29,380
That's right.

2763
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:32,480
I can't beat you, but at least he can because he's a stranger.

2764
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:37,480
Nice.

2765
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:39,100
Oh, not nice.

2766
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,300
Okay, nice.

2767
02:31:47,210 --> 02:31:49,350
Okay, I need to get this out of the way.

2768
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:52,350
Jesus Christ, he's so strong!

2769
02:31:52,910 --> 02:31:53,970
Why are you so tanky?

2770
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:54,510
Tanky!

2771
02:31:57,390 --> 02:31:57,990
Alright.

2772
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:03,830
Use the two wolves inside you!

2773
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:08,050
The two wolves!

2774
02:32:10,490 --> 02:32:13,270
Okay, now I'm just gonna let him do everything, I guess.

2775
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:14,430
Oh, shit.

2776
02:32:15,550 --> 02:32:16,230
There we go.

2777
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:17,790
Oh my god, I remember that.

2778
02:32:18,010 --> 02:32:20,030
I remember that fight.

2779
02:32:20,570 --> 02:32:22,150
I remember that fight.

2780
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:27,970
Oh, nice.

2781
02:32:28,150 --> 02:32:28,710
I did it.

2782
02:32:30,810 --> 02:32:31,290
Yeah!

2783
02:32:32,410 --> 02:32:33,890
Oh, I can upgrade my blade!

2784
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,320
Okay, heals...

2785
02:32:44,660 --> 02:32:45,620
No flame...

2786
02:32:45,620 --> 02:32:46,780
Wait, there's two doors.

2787
02:32:46,900 --> 02:32:48,240
Okay, this is the right way.

2788
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:50,740
Then where does this way go?

2789
02:32:53,260 --> 02:32:54,140
Wait, what?

2790
02:32:58,170 --> 02:32:59,310
Why did I...

2791
02:33:00,590 --> 02:33:02,330
What is this pathway for?

2792
02:33:04,310 --> 02:33:05,990
Ray, thank you for the super chat!

2793
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:07,050
Thank you, thank you!

2794
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:09,070
What is... Oh, I guess like a shortcut?

2795
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:16,700
Is this a shortcut area?

2796
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:19,140
Oh!

2797
02:33:19,880 --> 02:33:21,360
Wait, how do I get there?

2798
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:25,960
What's that for?

2799
02:33:29,330 --> 02:33:29,850
Huh?

2800
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:35,720
Okay, open the door.

2801
02:33:36,220 --> 02:33:37,900
Maybe I'll figure it out on the other side.

2802
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:38,540
Oh, okay.

2803
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,520
Oh, it's just another puzzle.

2804
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:47,180
What?

2805
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,880
What the fuck?!

2806
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:53,120
Okay, that's not fair.

2807
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:54,180
I literally just got here.

2808
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:57,580
Alright, nice.

2809
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:01,080
Wait, is he still alive?

2810
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:03,140
No, he's not.

2811
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:03,440
Okay.

2812
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:07,720
Alright, time for another puzzle!

2813
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:09,860
I love puzzles!

2814
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:12,500
Yippee!

2815
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:15,160
Now what?

2816
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,850
Wait, can I... I don't think that was right.

2817
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:22,610
Wait, what?

2818
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:28,470
How do I move this?

2819
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:32,630
Oh fuck, I went the wrong way.

2820
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,460
Move it here?

2821
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:42,600
I'm a little confused.

2822
02:34:45,950 --> 02:34:47,750
I don't think I like puzzles anymore.

2823
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:54,900
What?

2824
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:08,160
I can only move it front and back.

2825
02:35:12,450 --> 02:35:14,950
Maybe it's here and then I jump from the other side?

2826
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:17,150
Oh, maybe that's why I opened it!

2827
02:35:18,090 --> 02:35:19,250
It's not even a puzzle.

2828
02:35:19,430 --> 02:35:20,750
I just have to push at the end.

2829
02:35:25,530 --> 02:35:27,670
This is not even a puzzle!

2830
02:35:32,310 --> 02:35:33,810
I need some bathroom, guys.

2831
02:35:33,950 --> 02:35:34,490
I'll be right back.

2832
02:35:35,630 --> 02:35:36,630
Okay, never mind.

2833
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:37,970
I guess I don't use the bathroom.

2834
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:40,530
I guess...

2835
02:35:41,570 --> 02:35:43,790
I guess I don't use the bathroom.

2836
02:35:44,190 --> 02:35:45,510
I'm just gonna swing this axe.

2837
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,810
There we go.

2838
02:35:47,810 --> 02:35:49,510
Alright, now I use the bathroom.

2839
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:51,270
I'll be right back.

2840
02:38:40,960 --> 02:38:41,760
I'm back.

2841
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:44,180
I am back.

2842
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:46,640
Let me check my audio thing.

2843
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:48,940
Oh my god, I didn't realize it was at 84.

2844
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:52,060
Alright, I got myself some water, too.

2845
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:58,580
Mike, Mac, Puddle, Anton, Kaz, Maddie, Duck, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2846
02:38:58,620 --> 02:38:59,800
I really appreciate it.

2847
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:04,000
Johnny, Bite, Duck, Allen, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2848
02:39:05,940 --> 02:39:07,900
Well, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2849
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:10,320
I just got my YouTube joke in the mail, so excited.

2850
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:11,360
I'm so happy!

2851
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:12,740
A lot of my...

2852
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:16,340
A lot of people are getting their...

2853
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:18,980
Getting their merch now.

2854
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:21,540
Like the limited bundle and the YouTube stuff.

2855
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:23,080
So it makes me so excited.

2856
02:39:27,380 --> 02:39:27,820
That...

2857
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:31,920
Everything is sort of getting fixed now, merch-wise.

2858
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:35,060
There's still a few more things to fix at the moment.

2859
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:36,880
But like, you know, we're getting there.

2860
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:38,400
We're fucking getting there.

2861
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:41,740
Things are looking better now.

2862
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:45,720
Baldur?

2863
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:46,560
Where is he?

2864
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:50,260
Where the fuck do you see him?

2865
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:53,160
Alright, get on me, boy.

2866
02:39:58,830 --> 02:39:59,550
Is that his mom?

2867
02:40:01,690 --> 02:40:02,950
That's right, live through your trauma.

2868
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:11,490
But you can live forever.

2869
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:14,970
Wait,

2870
02:40:18,470 --> 02:40:19,430
he can't even...

2871
02:40:19,430 --> 02:40:22,310
Oh, nevermind, he might as well be dead.

2872
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:30,840
Do you not hear that?

2873
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:33,120
He can't even fucking bang!

2874
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:39,720
There's no backsies.

2875
02:40:45,560 --> 02:40:46,800
That is worse than death.

2876
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:51,420
Bro, like...

2877
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:53,000
He can't even...

2878
02:40:54,100 --> 02:40:57,520
Is he like, posturing a fucking clone?

2879
02:41:03,710 --> 02:41:04,370
Oh, what?

2880
02:41:11,140 --> 02:41:13,420
Wait, he hit his own mom!

2881
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:25,320
Do what?

2882
02:41:30,770 --> 02:41:31,170
What?

2883
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:32,410
Huh?

2884
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:36,550
What'd he do?

2885
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,620
Oh, because I didn't... he didn't... sorry, not I.

2886
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:45,980
He didn't kill his mom.

2887
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,140
I mean, killing his mom's not gonna fix anything.

2888
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:52,080
You want her alive to find a cure.

2889
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:19,320
Oh, he can't even...

2890
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:22,320
I just realized...

2891
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:29,500
He can't even, like, you know, maybe he does, you know, if he doesn't have the woman, he could, like, self-care, but he can't even do that.

2892
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:30,980
That's sad.

2893
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:32,540
How is he gonna relieve stress?

2894
02:42:48,860 --> 02:42:50,560
No wonder you went crazy.

2895
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:51,700
Holy shit.

2896
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:54,080
He's keeping all that inside.

2897
02:42:54,460 --> 02:42:55,120
I'm sorry.

2898
02:42:56,620 --> 02:42:57,380
I'm sorry.

2899
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:04,120
Every day is November for him, guys.

2900
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:07,220
Truly a fate worse than death.

2901
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:10,120
Every month is November.

2902
02:43:17,460 --> 02:43:20,040
Aw, look at him, he's crying.

2903
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:23,500
It's always November, Baldur.

2904
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:25,240
Always November.

2905
02:43:34,980 --> 02:43:36,060
No shit.

2906
02:43:38,480 --> 02:43:39,560
No shit.

2907
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:41,080
She literally said...

2908
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:45,600
She literally said she made his son painless.

2909
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:52,180
There's a chest over there.

2910
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:53,300
How do I get to the chest?

2911
02:43:58,490 --> 02:43:59,030
Here?

2912
02:43:59,210 --> 02:44:00,710
Oh, this must be where the chest is.

2913
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:06,500
Truly a terrifying fate.

2914
02:44:06,580 --> 02:44:08,960
I can't believe his own mom did that to him.

2915
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,140
Alright, nice.

2916
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:20,580
More steel.

2917
02:44:27,030 --> 02:44:29,810
The original Helicopter Parrot.

2918
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:31,350
Oh my god.

2919
02:44:31,950 --> 02:44:35,190
I think it's, like, worse, not gonna lie.

2920
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:38,770
That's, like, the worst type of Helicopter Parrot.

2921
02:44:45,030 --> 02:44:46,830
Alright, who wants to die?

2922
02:44:47,790 --> 02:44:49,570
That's fucking right, I got you.

2923
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:50,210
Don't worry.

2924
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:53,130
Don't worry, I got you.

2925
02:44:54,790 --> 02:44:56,390
I love this move the most.

2926
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:57,390
It's so easy.

2927
02:44:57,690 --> 02:44:59,110
It's so convenient.

2928
02:45:02,470 --> 02:45:06,030
Oh shit, I don't know why I actually swap weapons sometimes.

2929
02:45:07,830 --> 02:45:08,750
Alright, nice.

2930
02:45:09,350 --> 02:45:11,250
Oh shit, you can parry?!

2931
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:12,550
That should be illegal!

2932
02:45:16,830 --> 02:45:17,730
Okay, nice.

2933
02:45:18,690 --> 02:45:19,330
Dodge.

2934
02:45:20,810 --> 02:45:25,390
Sometimes I don't- I can't lock in the enemies and it's so fucking tilting a bit.

2935
02:45:25,630 --> 02:45:26,370
It's a little tilting.

2936
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:28,310
Get over here!

2937
02:45:28,910 --> 02:45:29,770
That's right!

2938
02:45:30,290 --> 02:45:31,770
I don't need my blades.

2939
02:45:32,750 --> 02:45:34,950
A pure manhood and you're dead.

2940
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:41,770
What?

2941
02:45:42,250 --> 02:45:42,630
Dad?

2942
02:45:44,650 --> 02:45:46,030
Wait, is that my dad?

2943
02:45:46,590 --> 02:45:47,030
Dad?

2944
02:45:48,790 --> 02:45:49,750
Dad, is that you?

2945
02:45:49,850 --> 02:45:50,950
You came back from milk?

2946
02:45:53,370 --> 02:45:54,610
Did I come from here?

2947
02:45:57,410 --> 02:45:58,390
I did, right?

2948
02:45:58,610 --> 02:45:58,990
No.

2949
02:46:00,770 --> 02:46:01,570
Wait, what?

2950
02:46:01,650 --> 02:46:03,010
Why is there two different ways?

2951
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:09,860
Oh my god, my dad came back from milk.

2952
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:14,060
Yeah, but, like, I got confused because there was, like, two different air- What?

2953
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:25,060
Okay, we gotta get the heals in.

2954
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:38,910
Okay, it's this way, but what's over here?

2955
02:46:40,050 --> 02:46:41,910
Oh, it's a puzzle.

2956
02:46:42,930 --> 02:46:46,530
Hey guys, it's our favorite time of the year!

2957
02:46:47,650 --> 02:46:49,990
It's puzzle season!

2958
02:46:49,990 --> 02:46:51,750
Can I push this off?

2959
02:46:52,970 --> 02:46:55,170
Oh my god!

2960
02:46:57,210 --> 02:46:57,850
Yippee!

2961
02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:00,290
Puzzles!

2962
02:47:07,420 --> 02:47:09,600
Alright, fire, fire, fire.

2963
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:18,840
Okay, if I have to do that, that means there has to be a blue thing here.

2964
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:21,920
Oh, please don't.

2965
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:24,880
Why did I have to cut this area if there's no blue thing?

2966
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:26,900
Where's the blue shards?

2967
02:47:35,380 --> 02:47:35,720
What?

2968
02:47:37,300 --> 02:47:39,120
Why did I have to cut that?

2969
02:47:46,210 --> 02:47:46,730
What?

2970
02:47:49,010 --> 02:47:50,550
Oh, I hate this puzzle.

2971
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:51,690
I hate this puzzle.

2972
02:47:51,790 --> 02:47:52,450
I hate it.

2973
02:47:52,770 --> 02:47:53,550
I hate it.

2974
02:47:53,770 --> 02:47:56,610
I fucking hate this puzzle the most.

2975
02:47:57,210 --> 02:47:58,970
I hate these puzzles!

2976
02:48:07,210 --> 02:48:08,950
Oh my god, wait, where did this come from?

2977
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:14,190
Wait, where did this block came from?

2978
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:19,800
What?

2979
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:26,900
Okay.

2980
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:33,860
And we go up.

2981
02:48:35,740 --> 02:48:37,080
This just gives me a chest.

2982
02:48:37,240 --> 02:48:38,220
Oh my god, there it is.

2983
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:38,800
There's one of them.

2984
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:40,260
Oh my god, I see it.

2985
02:48:40,620 --> 02:48:41,740
I fucking see it.

2986
02:48:41,740 --> 02:48:43,860
It's all the way over there.

2987
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:47,220
I got one of the three.

2988
02:48:48,060 --> 02:48:50,320
But where's the other two?

2989
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:00,600
Where's the other two?

2990
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:03,160
It's one of the three.

2991
02:49:04,060 --> 02:49:06,000
Oh, there's... Okay, two.

2992
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:07,860
Okay, last one.

2993
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:11,220
Oh my god, thank god.

2994
02:49:11,700 --> 02:49:13,240
Wait, but how do I get it?

2995
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:14,180
Wait.

2996
02:49:15,340 --> 02:49:15,980
Oh.

2997
02:49:16,480 --> 02:49:17,480
There's no...

2998
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:19,000
I can whip it, right?

2999
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:20,740
No, how do I...

3000
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:21,480
How?

3001
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:22,600
How?

3002
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:24,960
Wait.

3003
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:26,160
How?

3004
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:28,860
How do I get inside?

3005
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:33,380
There must be a way.

3006
02:49:39,290 --> 02:49:39,630
Wait.

3007
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:40,750
Okay.

3008
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:45,110
Oh my god, that's so dumb.

3009
02:49:45,210 --> 02:49:46,850
That's actually... I hate these puzzles.

3010
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:48,450
These puzzles are the worst.

3011
02:49:48,590 --> 02:49:49,650
These are the worst puzzles.

3012
02:49:53,750 --> 02:49:55,210
I'm already blind.

3013
02:49:58,090 --> 02:49:59,850
Like, I'm already blind.

3014
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:01,490
Why must you torture me so?

3015
02:50:01,890 --> 02:50:04,390
Oh my god, and then you add... Okay, goodbye.

3016
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:08,550
That's fine.

3017
02:50:11,050 --> 02:50:12,130
There we go.

3018
02:50:17,890 --> 02:50:18,850
Alright, this way.

3019
02:50:18,850 --> 02:50:19,310
Okay.

3020
02:50:22,730 --> 02:50:24,090
No wonder I'm in hell.

3021
02:50:24,270 --> 02:50:25,570
Oh my god, no wonder.

3022
02:50:25,730 --> 02:50:26,750
It all makes sense now.

3023
02:50:26,830 --> 02:50:27,930
This feels like hell.

3024
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:39,130
Now what do we do?

3025
02:50:39,790 --> 02:50:41,230
Let's just burn the bushes?

3026
02:50:42,870 --> 02:50:43,710
Is that it?

3027
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:51,360
What?

3028
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:54,200
What do I do now?

3029
02:51:00,050 --> 02:51:03,190
Now that my boat is on fire, what do I do?

3030
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:07,210
I'm so cold.

3031
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:14,810
What?

3032
02:51:16,030 --> 02:51:18,510
Arteus, are you actually cold right now?

3033
02:51:18,610 --> 02:51:19,490
What are you doing?

3034
02:51:19,730 --> 02:51:21,450
Why are you looking at your hands?

3035
02:51:21,550 --> 02:51:22,190
Are you okay?

3036
02:51:23,330 --> 02:51:25,050
Spencer, thank you for the super chat!

3037
02:51:25,170 --> 02:51:26,150
Thank you, thank you!

3038
02:51:27,290 --> 02:51:29,730
By watching the stream, you're already a dragoon!

3039
02:51:29,810 --> 02:51:30,350
Congratulations!

3040
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:36,870
How?

3041
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:42,340
What?

3042
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:52,350
What?

3043
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:02,100
What?

3044
02:52:09,050 --> 02:52:10,550
Where's my yellow paint?

3045
02:52:33,300 --> 02:52:34,080
What?

3046
02:52:40,270 --> 02:52:41,270
What?

3047
02:52:49,460 --> 02:52:50,730
Where am I?

3048
02:52:53,460 --> 02:52:54,090
What?

3049
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:57,590
Oh my god!

3050
02:52:57,750 --> 02:52:59,450
Okay, sorry.

3051
02:53:03,870 --> 02:53:09,110
Oh my god, it was like hidden in plain sight!

3052
02:53:10,630 --> 02:53:11,230
Why?

3053
02:53:12,930 --> 02:53:16,450
Oh my god, I can't...

3054
02:53:16,450 --> 02:53:17,830
Where's the yellow paint?

3055
02:53:20,450 --> 02:53:21,750
It was hidden!

3056
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:24,070
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

3057
02:53:25,850 --> 02:53:28,890
It's like the same color as the rest of the boat, guys.

3058
02:53:28,890 --> 02:53:32,450
Because it was designed to fly, this was not.

3059
02:53:38,170 --> 02:53:39,990
I'm gonna go get through Titanic.

3060
02:53:40,110 --> 02:53:41,230
Is there a Titanic here?

3061
02:53:42,090 --> 02:53:42,950
What's going on?

3062
02:53:44,310 --> 02:53:46,430
Oh shit, Anta, did you get the ships?

3063
02:53:46,570 --> 02:53:47,390
Thank you, thank you!

3064
02:53:52,970 --> 02:53:54,050
What do we do now?

3065
02:53:54,810 --> 02:53:55,190
Yeah.

3066
02:53:56,770 --> 02:53:59,410
Oh no, not another puzzle.

3067
02:54:05,290 --> 02:54:06,450
Oh no.

3068
02:54:07,530 --> 02:54:08,250
Please.

3069
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:14,420
Oh no.

3070
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:20,940
Oh no, I thought it was over.

3071
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:26,460
I'm thinking, boy!

3072
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:27,280
Oh, it's over here.

3073
02:54:27,640 --> 02:54:28,980
Oh, thank god it's over here.

3074
02:54:31,640 --> 02:54:33,960
Cut, cut, cut!

3075
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:36,900
Nice.

3076
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:41,400
Watch this.

3077
02:54:41,460 --> 02:54:43,240
I don't know what I'm doing, but watch this.

3078
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:48,280
Okay, now what?

3079
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:53,620
Now what?

3080
02:54:57,100 --> 02:54:57,860
Yeah?

3081
02:55:07,590 --> 02:55:08,630
The wheel?

3082
02:55:13,490 --> 02:55:15,450
Oh my god, it's like a hot air balloon!

3083
02:55:15,610 --> 02:55:16,450
We're gonna fly!

3084
02:55:18,050 --> 02:55:20,210
I made myself a hot air balloon!

3085
02:55:21,150 --> 02:55:24,710
God, I'm so smart, and that is why I'm a god.

3086
02:55:28,710 --> 02:55:31,870
Oh my god, wait, how do I steer this boat, though?

3087
02:55:33,870 --> 02:55:34,730
Oh, I don't.

3088
02:55:35,030 --> 02:55:36,050
I just go straight up.

3089
02:55:37,590 --> 02:55:39,530
Oh my god, all you do is fucking complain.

3090
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:46,860
Where do you get this from, boy?

3091
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:50,060
All you do is complain, complain, complain.

3092
02:55:52,480 --> 02:55:55,080
Okay, I got... Oh, nice.

3093
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:56,560
Legendary enchantment.

3094
02:55:59,100 --> 02:56:00,280
God, I'm so smart.

3095
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:01,380
It's like I'm a god.

3096
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:02,720
See how I did there?

3097
02:56:10,180 --> 02:56:12,640
I forgot I can grab, like, extra money here.

3098
02:56:17,950 --> 02:56:18,630
Uh...

3099
02:56:25,830 --> 02:56:26,510
Okay.

3100
02:56:29,290 --> 02:56:30,810
And then, boop!

3101
02:56:39,660 --> 02:56:41,400
Alright, to here.

3102
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:43,780
Oh shit!

3103
02:56:45,660 --> 02:56:46,340
Uh...

3104
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,320
Wait, there's stuff here.

3105
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:50,100
Oh no, now it'll never come back up.

3106
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:51,940
Oh fuck, okay.

3107
02:56:52,640 --> 02:56:54,160
Uh... I guess I go this way.

3108
02:56:57,530 --> 02:56:58,270
Wait, what?

3109
02:56:58,850 --> 02:57:00,030
There's like so- Oh wait!

3110
02:57:00,150 --> 02:57:00,910
No, it did work.

3111
02:57:00,970 --> 02:57:01,410
Oh, okay.

3112
02:57:02,830 --> 02:57:03,270
Nice.

3113
02:57:05,890 --> 02:57:08,230
Okay, and then I didn't need that, but that's alright.

3114
02:57:08,850 --> 02:57:10,690
I didn't need that, but that's alright again.

3115
02:57:12,750 --> 02:57:14,070
And then I go this way.

3116
02:57:16,270 --> 02:57:16,710
Wait,

3117
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:20,860
no.

3118
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:23,980
I didn't do what I was supposed to do.

3119
02:57:24,560 --> 02:57:25,780
The fuck was that?

3120
02:57:29,980 --> 02:57:30,320
What?

3121
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:42,080
What?

3122
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:50,240
The fuck was- Guys, sorry.

3123
02:57:50,360 --> 02:57:53,360
You can see the gears turning in my head right now.

3124
02:57:57,320 --> 02:57:58,940
It's going over time.

3125
02:58:00,180 --> 02:58:04,260
The little hamster in my head is, like, running as fast as it can.

3126
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:09,700
What?

3127
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:18,700
Look, the hamster- Look, guys, the hamster needs a little break, okay?

3128
02:58:20,480 --> 02:58:22,180
Wait, I'm back down here, though.

3129
02:58:26,060 --> 02:58:26,720
What?

3130
02:58:32,430 --> 02:58:34,630
Oh, I forgot this part!

3131
02:58:34,750 --> 02:58:35,930
Okay, sorry.

3132
02:58:36,610 --> 02:58:38,830
I forgot step one of this.

3133
02:58:43,580 --> 02:58:44,860
Give me a sec!

3134
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:47,540
Oh shit.

3135
02:58:48,020 --> 02:58:48,920
It'll be okay.

3136
02:58:51,380 --> 02:58:53,410
Sorry, I forgot step one.

3137
02:59:00,010 --> 02:59:03,510
I told you they always hide in plain sight!

3138
02:59:06,510 --> 02:59:08,510
The fucking wheels!

3139
02:59:16,480 --> 02:59:17,300
Goodbye.

3140
02:59:24,140 --> 02:59:25,780
Alright, we...

3141
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:26,880
We're gonna get out of here.

3142
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:29,060
Huh?

3143
02:59:30,440 --> 02:59:31,620
Is that me?

3144
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:33,200
That's me!

3145
02:59:33,620 --> 02:59:36,060
I'm gonna watch history in the making.

3146
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:41,120
Son, it's time to meet your grandpa.

3147
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:47,680
Skies of Helheim.

3148
02:59:50,340 --> 02:59:51,420
Oh, there it is!

3149
02:59:52,860 --> 02:59:53,860
What the fuck?

3150
03:00:00,380 --> 03:00:01,520
Okay, nice.

3151
03:00:07,480 --> 03:00:07,960
Nice.

3152
03:00:09,460 --> 03:00:10,640
That was pretty easy.

3153
03:00:12,920 --> 03:00:13,720
You know what?

3154
03:00:13,860 --> 03:00:14,360
Fuck it.

3155
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:16,080
Let's go back to our old ways.

3156
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:22,620
I don't even know which is faster.

3157
03:00:22,720 --> 03:00:23,540
Not gonna- Ha ha!

3158
03:00:23,740 --> 03:00:26,860
Which way is- It's FPS time!

3159
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:28,540
Nice.

3160
03:00:29,620 --> 03:00:30,160
Boop boop.

3161
03:00:32,480 --> 03:00:33,360
Alright, nice.

3162
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:37,060
Oh, fuck!

3163
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:38,140
That's fucking right!

3164
03:00:38,140 --> 03:00:41,240
I killed my father, I could kill you too.

3165
03:00:43,280 --> 03:00:45,000
You're about to become a dad?

3166
03:00:45,140 --> 03:00:46,720
That's good, cause I'm a father killer.

3167
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:48,960
I only kill dads.

3168
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:54,080
Nice.

3169
03:00:54,340 --> 03:00:55,800
God of FPS.

3170
03:00:58,700 --> 03:00:59,260
Alright.

3171
03:00:59,560 --> 03:01:00,480
Boop boop boop boop.

3172
03:01:00,620 --> 03:01:02,940
Jesus Christ, how many are you guys?

3173
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:04,500
We're literally in hell.

3174
03:01:04,580 --> 03:01:06,620
If you die in hell, you never come back.

3175
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:08,800
Oh, shit.

3176
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:12,540
It's okay, I have invisibility frames because I'm doing a finisher.

3177
03:01:15,100 --> 03:01:15,580
What?

3178
03:01:19,190 --> 03:01:20,410
What's going on?

3179
03:01:24,730 --> 03:01:26,170
Wait, how do I free us?

3180
03:01:27,450 --> 03:01:28,910
Wait, how do I free us though?

3181
03:01:29,290 --> 03:01:29,610
Wait!

3182
03:01:30,250 --> 03:01:33,050
Okay, I need you to defend me if I'm gonna do this!

3183
03:01:33,110 --> 03:01:34,210
I'm trying to figure it out!

3184
03:01:34,970 --> 03:01:35,750
They're boarding!

3185
03:01:36,330 --> 03:01:37,910
The pirates are here!

3186
03:01:38,970 --> 03:01:40,330
Oh my god, Artaeus!

3187
03:01:40,450 --> 03:01:41,170
Okay, pick one!

3188
03:01:41,310 --> 03:01:42,970
I either free us or like...

3189
03:01:44,010 --> 03:01:45,350
Pick one, Artaeus!

3190
03:01:48,530 --> 03:01:50,910
Oh no, I don't know how to fucking...

3191
03:02:10,220 --> 03:02:12,720
Oh no, they're coming for my treasure.

3192
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:17,040
Okay, now...

3193
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,480
Oh, I had to kill all of them first.

3194
03:02:19,580 --> 03:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

3195
03:02:20,120 --> 03:02:22,540
They keep saying, they're like, Artaeus, cover me!

3196
03:02:22,780 --> 03:02:26,100
So I was like, okay, clearly I can do that now, right?

3197
03:02:26,180 --> 03:02:26,280
Can we do it?

3198
03:02:27,180 --> 03:02:29,900
Can we do it?

3199
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:35,880
Like, context-wise, I thought I was fine.

3200
03:02:41,360 --> 03:02:42,000
Alright,

3201
03:02:45,660 --> 03:02:46,460
we should be fine.

3202
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:51,680
What the fuck are you doing up there?

3203
03:02:51,780 --> 03:02:52,380
Get down!

3204
03:02:54,100 --> 03:02:55,180
That's fucking right.

3205
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:58,820
Wait, why do I keep accidentally using...

3206
03:02:58,820 --> 03:03:02,920
I keep accidentally using my axe.

3207
03:03:04,380 --> 03:03:05,880
Oh, I have to light the fire?

3208
03:03:06,220 --> 03:03:06,840
Oh shit!

3209
03:03:07,020 --> 03:03:07,620
Oh fuck, okay.

3210
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:09,620
Sorry, give me a sec, pirates!

3211
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:11,640
This is much more important!

3212
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:14,840
Sorry, pirates!

3213
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:19,600
I forgot a hot air balloon needs fire.

3214
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:24,700
Where's the other fire?

3215
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:25,560
Where's the other one?

3216
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:27,360
Give me a sec, I'm lighting the fire!

3217
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:32,060
Wait, what the fuck are you doing to my fire?

3218
03:03:32,780 --> 03:03:33,480
Be gone!

3219
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:42,480
Just cuz I discovered fire and you're jealous doesn't mean you can just un-light it.

3220
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:47,540
See, this is what happens when you become famous.

3221
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:49,120
All these people...

3222
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:50,860
They wanna take your...

3223
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:52,720
They wanna take everything from you.

3224
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:58,100
Jesus Christ, I have to light it up again.

3225
03:03:58,480 --> 03:04:01,020
Why don't you extinguish the other fire?

3226
03:04:06,060 --> 03:04:06,760
Nice.

3227
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:10,960
Yeah, they're fucking haters.

3228
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:14,200
They're just jealous.

3229
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:16,920
Alright, get out.

3230
03:04:17,240 --> 03:04:20,520
Alright, gotta go back and light this fire again!

3231
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:21,940
Yippee!

3232
03:04:25,700 --> 03:04:26,760
Okay, I don't need your finisher.

3233
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:28,080
The finisher takes too much time.

3234
03:04:28,180 --> 03:04:29,840
I feel like I kill them way too fast.

3235
03:04:30,660 --> 03:04:32,300
If I don't do finishers.

3236
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:34,320
Oh, we're here!

3237
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:41,380
Oh my god.

3238
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:42,300
Please!

3239
03:04:46,360 --> 03:04:47,500
I need to hit him more?

3240
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:48,860
I can put more fire?

3241
03:04:54,340 --> 03:04:57,140
Oh my god, it's always this one!

3242
03:04:58,440 --> 03:04:59,800
Why is...

3243
03:04:59,800 --> 03:05:03,480
Why is it always...

3244
03:05:03,480 --> 03:05:04,120
Oh man.

3245
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,540
It's always this one.

3246
03:05:09,640 --> 03:05:11,700
Oh no, they're gonna turn...

3247
03:05:14,320 --> 03:05:17,360
Okay, now they hate this fire too.

3248
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:19,060
Alright, I see you.

3249
03:05:19,700 --> 03:05:21,060
I fucking see you.

3250
03:05:22,380 --> 03:05:25,960
Just cause I give the other fire more attention!

3251
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:34,080
Alright, nice.

3252
03:05:34,940 --> 03:05:36,340
Oh no, it's the other hook.

3253
03:05:38,660 --> 03:05:40,420
Oh no, two hooks?!

3254
03:05:41,800 --> 03:05:42,920
Did I kill everything?

3255
03:05:43,280 --> 03:05:44,740
Well, I think I killed everybody though.

3256
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:50,680
What's stronger than one hook, two hooks?

3257
03:05:51,440 --> 03:05:54,020
Oh no, I hate these witches.

3258
03:05:54,720 --> 03:05:57,180
I hate the witches the most.

3259
03:05:59,300 --> 03:06:00,540
Jesus Christ.

3260
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:02,620
These witches are so annoying!

3261
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:08,620
I think the witches are the most annoying one cause they dodge you unless you use magic.

3262
03:06:09,500 --> 03:06:12,080
Unless you hit them with a bow first.

3263
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:14,600
They're so annoying!

3264
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,480
I'm gonna punch her!

3265
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:22,900
I treat everybody equally!

3266
03:06:25,570 --> 03:06:26,480
Alright, nice.

3267
03:06:28,820 --> 03:06:30,930
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna...

3268
03:06:31,900 --> 03:06:32,720
Fucking...

3269
03:06:33,580 --> 03:06:34,820
Doesn't matter.

3270
03:06:35,500 --> 03:06:37,120
Doesn't matter who you are.

3271
03:06:37,280 --> 03:06:39,000
Everyone gets the same treatment.

3272
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:48,320
Honestly, my favorite move.

3273
03:06:50,680 --> 03:06:51,280
Alright, nice.

3274
03:06:52,580 --> 03:06:55,300
That's right, these fists are rated E for everyone.

3275
03:06:56,540 --> 03:06:57,700
Okay, nice.

3276
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:00,120
Second hook!

3277
03:07:00,660 --> 03:07:01,320
Down!

3278
03:07:02,820 --> 03:07:04,140
Gender equality.

3279
03:07:05,740 --> 03:07:07,300
Do I have to light them up again?

3280
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,940
God fucking damn it.

3281
03:07:11,370 --> 03:07:11,700
Alright.

3282
03:07:13,440 --> 03:07:14,660
That should be good.

3283
03:07:15,900 --> 03:07:17,340
Are we there yet?

3284
03:07:26,740 --> 03:07:27,700
We there?

3285
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:29,660
Are we finally there, Meemer?

3286
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:31,700
Did we fucking made it?

3287
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:34,400
Did we actually made it?

3288
03:07:39,490 --> 03:07:40,650
Oh my god.

3289
03:07:41,090 --> 03:07:43,210
Where the fuck are we supposed to go?

3290
03:07:44,810 --> 03:07:46,710
Why can't my hot air...

3291
03:07:46,710 --> 03:07:49,610
Why can't I add a motor to my hot air balloon?

3292
03:07:51,590 --> 03:07:52,670
Oh shit.

3293
03:07:53,150 --> 03:07:55,330
You know he's stronger cause he's taller.

3294
03:07:56,030 --> 03:07:56,950
Alright, good for you.

3295
03:07:56,950 --> 03:07:58,090
Goodbye, but I'm taller.

3296
03:07:58,170 --> 03:07:59,870
I'm even taller than you.

3297
03:08:00,590 --> 03:08:02,250
You might be taller.

3298
03:08:03,210 --> 03:08:04,610
But I'm the tallest.

3299
03:08:06,330 --> 03:08:07,710
Wait, I could just do that?

3300
03:08:10,430 --> 03:08:11,230
Oh shit.

3301
03:08:11,930 --> 03:08:12,770
Oh shit.

3302
03:08:12,910 --> 03:08:13,770
Wait, wait, wait, I got an idea.

3303
03:08:14,170 --> 03:08:14,970
Guys, watch this.

3304
03:08:17,430 --> 03:08:18,950
Wait, no, that's the wrong one.

3305
03:08:19,370 --> 03:08:19,690
No!

3306
03:08:19,910 --> 03:08:20,450
I fucking...

3307
03:08:20,450 --> 03:08:21,790
Wait, wait, wait, watch this though.

3308
03:08:21,870 --> 03:08:22,570
This is gonna look...

3309
03:08:22,570 --> 03:08:23,750
This is gonna be so cool.

3310
03:08:28,650 --> 03:08:29,570
It was worth...

3311
03:08:29,570 --> 03:08:31,030
That setup was so worth it though.

3312
03:08:35,510 --> 03:08:36,910
Okay, not gonna lie.

3313
03:08:37,610 --> 03:08:39,470
That setup was worth it.

3314
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:40,930
Got him.

3315
03:08:41,590 --> 03:08:42,430
It took me three...

3316
03:08:42,430 --> 03:08:45,190
I don't understand why he couldn't see it from a mile away.

3317
03:08:45,310 --> 03:08:47,150
It took me like three tries to get it right.

3318
03:08:49,810 --> 03:08:51,630
Okay, I can do it again too.

3319
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:52,730
Oh shit.

3320
03:08:52,870 --> 03:08:53,510
God damn it!

3321
03:08:54,350 --> 03:08:55,530
Alright, nice.

3322
03:08:59,380 --> 03:09:00,780
Wait, is that another big boy?

3323
03:09:02,140 --> 03:09:02,920
Wait a minute.

3324
03:09:04,180 --> 03:09:05,140
Wait, wait a minute.

3325
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:06,660
That's another big boy.

3326
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:07,600
No!

3327
03:09:10,280 --> 03:09:11,580
God damn it!

3328
03:09:15,100 --> 03:09:15,740
Oh my...

3329
03:09:15,740 --> 03:09:17,140
Oh fucking Chorus.

3330
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:20,960
They're like, you know what we haven't seen in a while?

3331
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:22,680
A fucking troll.

3332
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:25,920
Like...

3333
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:28,540
Of course.

3334
03:09:29,540 --> 03:09:33,220
It's been a while since we've seen a troll, guys.

3335
03:09:34,240 --> 03:09:35,640
Oh man.

3336
03:09:36,640 --> 03:09:38,600
That's what I miss.

3337
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:40,420
Oh hey.

3338
03:09:41,140 --> 03:09:42,500
It's been one hour.

3339
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,080
We haven't seen a troll yet.

3340
03:09:45,900 --> 03:09:47,220
It's troll time.

3341
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:51,440
Alright, here we go.

3342
03:09:53,300 --> 03:09:54,180
That's fucking right.

3343
03:09:54,420 --> 03:09:55,260
Stop hitting yourself.

3344
03:09:55,860 --> 03:09:56,880
Stop hitting yourself.

3345
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:57,220
Stop hitting yourself.

3346
03:09:57,540 --> 03:09:58,860
Stop hitting yourself.

3347
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:05,380
There we go.

3348
03:10:06,100 --> 03:10:07,000
Thank God.

3349
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:09,300
I'm so tired of the trolls.

3350
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:13,420
Wait, what?

3351
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:16,080
Oh, I'm so angry.

3352
03:10:16,220 --> 03:10:17,180
I was like, what the fuck?

3353
03:10:18,740 --> 03:10:20,740
I was like, why am I still using my fists?

3354
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:27,060
Oh, there's still people still alive.

3355
03:10:27,160 --> 03:10:27,440
Okay.

3356
03:10:28,120 --> 03:10:29,920
I was gonna be like, where the fuck?

3357
03:10:30,120 --> 03:10:31,460
How can I not climb up?

3358
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:35,420
Trolls, ogres, they're all the same.

3359
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:36,340
Dead.

3360
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:42,820
Alright, nice.

3361
03:10:43,220 --> 03:10:45,160
Let's grab the loot here.

3362
03:10:49,580 --> 03:10:50,140
Gasp.

3363
03:10:50,860 --> 03:10:52,220
You can't just, you can't say that, Doki.

3364
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:56,640
Alright.

3365
03:10:58,400 --> 03:10:59,680
Go up here.

3366
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:06,920
Come on, lift, Kratos.

3367
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:08,200
Lift!

3368
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:27,780
What did I do?

3369
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:31,680
Boy, come over here.

3370
03:11:31,860 --> 03:11:33,600
It's time to experience trauma.

3371
03:11:36,040 --> 03:11:38,220
It's the only way to bond.

3372
03:11:44,640 --> 03:11:45,680
That's right.

3373
03:11:47,420 --> 03:11:53,560
I killed my father and my father killed his father and his father killed his father.

3374
03:11:54,060 --> 03:11:56,040
And soon you will kill me too.

3375
03:11:58,200 --> 03:11:59,620
Generational trauma.

3376
03:12:22,780 --> 03:12:25,520
Gotta keep that cycle going.

3377
03:12:26,300 --> 03:12:26,960
Jump!

3378
03:12:31,620 --> 03:12:34,200
I love physics in God of War.

3379
03:12:47,690 --> 03:12:48,350
Nice.

3380
03:12:49,210 --> 03:12:50,330
That was my plan.

3381
03:12:50,950 --> 03:12:51,170
Yeah.

3382
03:12:52,370 --> 03:12:53,950
I mean, it worked the first time.

3383
03:12:56,810 --> 03:13:00,850
If it worked the first time, it'll work again, Meemers.

3384
03:13:01,090 --> 03:13:01,550
Shush.

3385
03:13:03,690 --> 03:13:04,970
Alright, let's see.

3386
03:13:07,610 --> 03:13:10,190
I'm just gonna keep doing it until it works, Meemers.

3387
03:13:10,290 --> 03:13:11,130
That's how it goes.

3388
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:24,060
Wait, what?

3389
03:13:27,240 --> 03:13:32,920
Ryuji, I'm sad to hear about your graduation announcement, but best of luck to your future endeavors.

3390
03:13:33,140 --> 03:13:35,240
We'll support you no matter what.

3391
03:13:35,380 --> 03:13:36,580
Thank you for the super chat.

3392
03:13:36,660 --> 03:13:37,440
Thank you, thank you.

3393
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:38,120
But what?

3394
03:13:41,240 --> 03:13:41,760
Huh?

3395
03:13:42,820 --> 03:13:46,160
Did anything happen on Twitter while streaming God of War?

3396
03:13:46,440 --> 03:13:47,440
Alright, let's see.

3397
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:53,140
What the fuck happened?

3398
03:13:57,700 --> 03:13:58,580
Oh, nothing.

3399
03:13:58,860 --> 03:14:00,380
Okay, it's just...

3400
03:14:00,380 --> 03:14:02,080
Okay, I was gonna be like...

3401
03:14:02,080 --> 03:14:03,360
Okay, nothing happened.

3402
03:14:03,480 --> 03:14:04,040
Alright, that's cool.

3403
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:05,580
I was like...

3404
03:14:05,580 --> 03:14:06,560
I got a little...

3405
03:14:06,560 --> 03:14:08,100
I got a little being like...

3406
03:14:08,100 --> 03:14:09,720
Did you have the wrong stream open?

3407
03:14:11,500 --> 03:14:12,440
This is what?

3408
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:13,580
Oh, shit.

3409
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:15,200
Sorry, I forgot we're in...

3410
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:18,440
Are we in 2020?

3411
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:22,460
Alright.

3412
03:14:22,460 --> 03:14:22,740
Alright.

3413
03:14:26,770 --> 03:14:27,750
Let's see.

3414
03:14:28,810 --> 03:14:30,210
Oh yeah, I got the loot.

3415
03:14:33,780 --> 03:14:36,180
Sorry, he's still stuck in 2020, guys.

3416
03:14:36,400 --> 03:14:38,340
He's just a confused Barknight.

3417
03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:42,660
Someone's lost in time.

3418
03:14:46,320 --> 03:14:47,700
Oh, there is!

3419
03:14:56,540 --> 03:14:59,260
Oh yeah, that's gonna be like what happened to Tyr.

3420
03:14:59,500 --> 03:15:00,460
What happened to him?

3421
03:15:03,380 --> 03:15:05,660
He woke up from his coma in 2020.

3422
03:15:12,980 --> 03:15:14,800
Where is he traveling to?

3423
03:15:19,360 --> 03:15:19,860
Yeah.

3424
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:33,540
Huh?

3425
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:37,480
That's my symbol!

3426
03:15:41,420 --> 03:15:43,280
That's my God of War symbol!

3427
03:15:43,280 --> 03:15:44,800
His eyes.

3428
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:46,600
They are jewels.

3429
03:15:47,880 --> 03:15:48,520
Like yours.

3430
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:52,640
No doubt signifying the gift of sight the Giants granted us.

3431
03:15:53,280 --> 03:15:54,260
Give me a closer look.

3432
03:15:57,540 --> 03:15:58,200
Interesting.

3433
03:16:01,100 --> 03:16:01,320
What?

3434
03:16:07,120 --> 03:16:08,440
Very interesting.

3435
03:16:09,140 --> 03:16:11,640
What did he fucking do with his special eyes?

3436
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:14,500
Concealed by Tyr so none could access Baham.

3437
03:16:14,960 --> 03:16:17,420
And those few others the Giants trusted.

3438
03:16:18,340 --> 03:16:20,060
And right under Odin's nose.

3439
03:16:20,840 --> 03:16:23,240
I did promise I'd get you to Jotunheim.

3440
03:16:23,720 --> 03:16:24,680
What do you mean, Ed?

3441
03:16:25,320 --> 03:16:27,000
You said we were out of options.

3442
03:16:27,740 --> 03:16:28,800
Don't you see, brother?

3443
03:16:29,460 --> 03:16:31,760
Odin never gave up hope and neither should we.

3444
03:16:32,440 --> 03:16:35,500
He knew there was a clue in here, but we are the ones who found it.

3445
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:39,020
These plans are for a key to some chamber Tyr's kept hidden.

3446
03:16:39,500 --> 03:16:42,940
I don't know where it's leading or what we'll find, but it's a path.

3447
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:47,400
How do we make this key?

3448
03:16:48,460 --> 03:16:49,840
I suggest we ask a dwarf.

3449
03:16:51,280 --> 03:16:53,780
The one that my son didn't piss off.

3450
03:16:54,140 --> 03:16:56,720
That symbol on the temple door.

3451
03:16:57,440 --> 03:16:58,620
It's a bunch of runes together.

3452
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:03,580
Peace, unity, hope, other things too.

3453
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:05,080
Tyr's own design.

3454
03:17:05,560 --> 03:17:06,980
He made this door himself.

3455
03:17:08,420 --> 03:17:10,360
Things that gods don't do.

3456
03:17:11,120 --> 03:17:13,000
No wonder Odin was mad.

3457
03:17:14,480 --> 03:17:15,360
Fuck your pots.

3458
03:17:19,240 --> 03:17:20,540
Ryuji, thank you for the super chat.

3459
03:17:20,620 --> 03:17:20,880
Thank you.

3460
03:17:20,940 --> 03:17:21,640
Thank you.

3461
03:17:21,780 --> 03:17:23,980
Sorry about that announcement in the title.

3462
03:17:24,140 --> 03:17:25,680
Made me thought it was that.

3463
03:17:25,820 --> 03:17:27,160
Thank you for the super chat.

3464
03:17:27,280 --> 03:17:27,580
Thank you.

3465
03:17:27,660 --> 03:17:28,340
Thank you.

3466
03:17:28,900 --> 03:17:30,220
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

3467
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:30,520
Thank you.

3468
03:17:30,580 --> 03:17:30,940
Thank you.

3469
03:17:31,020 --> 03:17:32,840
What do your memerize see, memer?

3470
03:17:35,900 --> 03:17:37,680
I just thought you were stuck in a coma.

3471
03:17:38,420 --> 03:17:42,260
And you just woke up and it was 2020 when you got put under.

3472
03:17:53,940 --> 03:17:56,000
What about our trauma bonding?

3473
03:18:07,250 --> 03:18:09,390
Thank god my boy got better at lying.

3474
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:11,490
He's growing up so fast.

3475
03:18:17,930 --> 03:18:19,870
Oh, I have to...

3476
03:18:19,870 --> 03:18:21,810
Oh, am I not back in Midgard yet?

3477
03:18:22,710 --> 03:18:23,830
Oh, I'm in Helheim.

3478
03:18:23,950 --> 03:18:24,230
I forgot.

3479
03:18:24,510 --> 03:18:24,750
Yeah.

3480
03:18:25,850 --> 03:18:27,530
Okay, let's swap to...

3481
03:18:28,590 --> 03:18:30,650
Alright, I leave Baldur in Helheim.

3482
03:18:30,790 --> 03:18:32,430
There's no way he sneaked back in.

3483
03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:45,780
Look, I didn't say he's getting better.

3484
03:18:45,920 --> 03:18:48,900
I didn't say he's getting better, but now he's actually lying.

3485
03:18:51,060 --> 03:18:52,780
So like, that's a little better.

3486
03:18:55,340 --> 03:19:00,400
Before he was like, it's all about the truth, but now he lies to my face so he's growing up.

3487
03:19:28,620 --> 03:19:29,300
Huh?

3488
03:19:43,960 --> 03:19:47,380
Oh, so he can't say what his weakness is.

3489
03:20:01,780 --> 03:20:03,180
It's like a blade.

3490
03:20:03,380 --> 03:20:03,880
I remember.

3491
03:20:04,420 --> 03:20:10,220
Well, I don't know if this follows like the actual Norse myths, but it's like a special blade.

3492
03:20:14,220 --> 03:20:17,580
He's a broken AI before AI.

3493
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:23,580
No?

3494
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:37,880
Wait, where the fuck did he come from?

3495
03:20:51,980 --> 03:20:52,580
Huh?

3496
03:20:54,160 --> 03:20:55,260
What's that?

3497
03:20:56,480 --> 03:20:57,180
What is that?

3498
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:03,000
Oh my god, not his hands!

3499
03:21:04,120 --> 03:21:05,700
Did you also bend over?

3500
03:21:08,480 --> 03:21:09,020
What?

3501
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:09,740
You?

3502
03:21:10,020 --> 03:21:12,280
You're fine with working on something that's not a weapon?

3503
03:21:19,720 --> 03:21:21,140
Wait, he's shorter?

3504
03:21:21,880 --> 03:21:23,600
He can be even shorter?

3505
03:21:24,120 --> 03:21:26,160
I thought the other brother was shorter.

3506
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:49,080
What?

3507
03:21:50,460 --> 03:21:51,660
I did it!

3508
03:21:55,420 --> 03:21:57,880
Oh, it's like his all...

3509
03:21:58,740 --> 03:22:01,940
They can work together!

3510
03:22:03,880 --> 03:22:05,940
Oh my god!

3511
03:22:06,940 --> 03:22:10,120
We brought the brothers back together!

3512
03:22:29,610 --> 03:22:31,820
Oh my god, we did it guys.

3513
03:22:31,900 --> 03:22:33,900
We accomplished our main goal.

3514
03:22:40,510 --> 03:22:41,110
Aww.

3515
03:22:49,650 --> 03:22:52,090
Sorry, he's still a germaphobic though.

3516
03:22:52,650 --> 03:22:53,790
We did it!

3517
03:22:53,890 --> 03:22:54,910
We finished God of War!

3518
03:22:59,210 --> 03:23:03,550
Alright, so we got a... Oh hey, blade of chaos upgrade.

3519
03:23:03,750 --> 03:23:04,130
Nice.

3520
03:23:06,690 --> 03:23:07,650
That's cute.

3521
03:23:07,850 --> 03:23:09,030
I'm glad they like...

3522
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:13,650
They work together to help me kill a god.

3523
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:15,310
I like that.

3524
03:23:16,370 --> 03:23:20,910
No matter what, at least they have... They unite together on something they hate too.

3525
03:23:21,650 --> 03:23:28,370
Oh yeah, we haven't upgraded anything in a while.

3526
03:23:28,730 --> 03:23:30,470
Let's see, is there anything?

3527
03:23:33,730 --> 03:23:35,070
Oh wait, I can upgrade this.

3528
03:23:35,130 --> 03:23:36,510
This is the strongest one, right?

3529
03:23:36,510 --> 03:23:38,910
The Hyperion Slam?

3530
03:23:40,330 --> 03:23:43,510
Hyperion Slam is the strong one, right?

3531
03:23:49,580 --> 03:23:51,240
Okay, I'll upgrade it.

3532
03:23:51,980 --> 03:23:52,580
Nice!

3533
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:55,960
Alright, and then I guess I'll upgrade this since I have so much money.

3534
03:24:01,580 --> 03:24:02,860
I'll upgrade this.

3535
03:24:04,960 --> 03:24:05,760
Wait.

3536
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:09,540
Raw stun damage.

3537
03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:10,980
But I'll upgrade this.

3538
03:24:16,460 --> 03:24:19,740
I like the wrath of the wolf the most.

3539
03:24:23,280 --> 03:24:25,280
The zero vitality run?

3540
03:24:29,940 --> 03:24:31,940
What does vitality do?

3541
03:24:34,800 --> 03:24:35,600
Oh.

3542
03:24:36,440 --> 03:24:37,700
Am I supposed to have more HP?

3543
03:24:37,860 --> 03:24:38,180
Oh.

3544
03:24:38,180 --> 03:24:38,360
Oh.

3545
03:24:44,490 --> 03:24:45,410
Whoops.

3546
03:24:52,390 --> 03:24:56,590
I was a... Unintentional gaming.

3547
03:25:00,710 --> 03:25:03,010
I was just that much of a gamer.

3548
03:25:03,190 --> 03:25:05,250
What can I say, guys?

3549
03:25:06,370 --> 03:25:07,750
Unintentional gaming.

3550
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:15,060
Oh yeah.

3551
03:25:15,300 --> 03:25:17,060
Yeah, upgrade all of these.

3552
03:25:19,540 --> 03:25:20,500
Look at that.

3553
03:25:21,060 --> 03:25:25,420
I'm such a gamer that it was just that easy.

3554
03:25:27,080 --> 03:25:28,900
The game was too easy.

3555
03:25:29,060 --> 03:25:32,320
I just had to make it more challenging.

3556
03:25:33,620 --> 03:25:34,000
How much?

3557
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:35,040
Okay, I still have a lot.

3558
03:25:36,200 --> 03:25:37,340
Let's upgrade everything.

3559
03:25:37,560 --> 03:25:37,980
Fuck it.

3560
03:25:47,610 --> 03:25:48,110
Am I ready?

3561
03:25:48,290 --> 03:25:49,890
Yeah, I can just max everything out.

3562
03:25:51,390 --> 03:25:54,170
Like how I maxed everything, but like, fuck this shit.

3563
03:25:56,050 --> 03:25:57,770
Wait, I should... Wait, wait.

3564
03:25:58,010 --> 03:25:59,310
I forgot.

3565
03:25:59,670 --> 03:26:00,890
Wait, I forgot.

3566
03:26:01,190 --> 03:26:04,370
I didn't realize my rage has been baby mode this entire time.

3567
03:26:04,510 --> 03:26:04,750
Okay.

3568
03:26:05,230 --> 03:26:09,110
Let me get... Let me make sure my rage is good.

3569
03:26:09,610 --> 03:26:10,730
Let me...

3570
03:26:11,330 --> 03:26:13,470
Alright, other than that, none of these matter.

3571
03:26:24,990 --> 03:26:28,370
Can't believe I made it this far with the fucked up build I have.

3572
03:26:38,190 --> 03:26:40,290
Yeah, that was a different me.

3573
03:26:44,890 --> 03:26:49,810
We get what?

3574
03:26:50,570 --> 03:26:51,730
Oh, he's gonna cry.

3575
03:26:53,930 --> 03:26:55,310
Okay, we go this way.

3576
03:27:04,960 --> 03:27:08,160
Alright, we have to go back to Tears area.

3577
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:09,620
It should be this way.

3578
03:27:14,490 --> 03:27:16,370
How much do I have left of the game?

3579
03:27:16,470 --> 03:27:18,150
I feel like I made so much progress.

3580
03:27:18,550 --> 03:27:19,710
I mean, I got out of hell.

3581
03:27:22,890 --> 03:27:23,730
Is it here?

3582
03:27:25,310 --> 03:27:26,570
No, it's not here.

3583
03:27:29,510 --> 03:27:30,630
Not a lot?

3584
03:27:31,030 --> 03:27:31,970
There's no way.

3585
03:27:32,070 --> 03:27:33,650
I must be getting... There's no way.

3586
03:27:33,730 --> 03:27:36,670
I literally... I went through so many character arcs.

3587
03:27:37,490 --> 03:27:39,710
There's no way there's not a lot.

3588
03:27:39,930 --> 03:27:43,170
I went through so many character arcs for this.

3589
03:27:43,170 --> 03:27:45,050
Oh, that's what the keys were.

3590
03:27:54,190 --> 03:27:54,870
Nice.

3591
03:27:57,630 --> 03:27:59,650
Okay, this hidden chamber.

3592
03:28:01,690 --> 03:28:02,670
Yeah, what is this?

3593
03:28:06,330 --> 03:28:07,470
Shoot this.

3594
03:28:08,070 --> 03:28:08,390
Yay!

3595
03:28:09,930 --> 03:28:10,610
Skybridge!

3596
03:28:14,890 --> 03:28:16,730
Oh, we are underneath.

3597
03:28:21,790 --> 03:28:22,530
Okay.

3598
03:28:24,870 --> 03:28:27,130
Oh, that's interesting.

3599
03:28:29,070 --> 03:28:30,810
What am I supposed to do here?

3600
03:28:31,570 --> 03:28:32,630
Do I shoot this?

3601
03:28:33,410 --> 03:28:34,170
What is that?

3602
03:28:34,890 --> 03:28:35,870
Hey, what's that?

3603
03:28:37,870 --> 03:28:39,310
What is that?

3604
03:28:44,620 --> 03:28:47,420
Yeah, how do I get it?

3605
03:28:48,900 --> 03:28:50,860
I'm just walking around in a circle.

3606
03:28:58,930 --> 03:28:59,450
Okay.

3607
03:29:04,130 --> 03:29:05,190
Wait, where?

3608
03:29:05,350 --> 03:29:06,170
Where are you?

3609
03:29:08,230 --> 03:29:09,630
Where did my boy go?

3610
03:29:10,150 --> 03:29:11,750
Do I have to use an axe on this?

3611
03:29:19,440 --> 03:29:19,960
No.

3612
03:29:22,740 --> 03:29:24,180
Oh, I have to talk to him.

3613
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:33,240
Interesting.

3614
03:29:34,260 --> 03:29:35,140
But can we reach it?

3615
03:29:36,240 --> 03:29:36,800
Oh.

3616
03:29:40,740 --> 03:29:41,480
Oh, it just opens.

3617
03:29:41,560 --> 03:29:41,760
Okay.

3618
03:29:43,240 --> 03:29:43,800
Okay.

3619
03:29:44,620 --> 03:29:45,620
What is that?

3620
03:29:48,380 --> 03:29:48,940
Huh?

3621
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:53,920
Oh, there's a door?

3622
03:29:55,300 --> 03:29:56,680
No, I came from here.

3623
03:29:58,160 --> 03:29:59,620
Didn't I came from here?

3624
03:30:01,880 --> 03:30:03,200
No, that's different.

3625
03:30:03,280 --> 03:30:03,940
Oh.

3626
03:30:10,720 --> 03:30:15,420
What do they do?

3627
03:30:20,370 --> 03:30:21,410
There's more frost.

3628
03:30:21,550 --> 03:30:22,530
There's the snake.

3629
03:30:24,770 --> 03:30:27,150
Um, now I have- I brought a woman.

3630
03:30:28,910 --> 03:30:30,110
Now an army?

3631
03:30:31,270 --> 03:30:31,730
Vikings?

3632
03:30:31,890 --> 03:30:32,750
Question mark?

3633
03:30:36,600 --> 03:30:38,320
Oh, now I'm on the other side.

3634
03:30:40,280 --> 03:30:40,740
Okay.

3635
03:30:42,440 --> 03:30:43,160
Wait, what?

3636
03:30:43,240 --> 03:30:44,040
Did I miss something?

3637
03:30:46,580 --> 03:30:48,660
I thought I was just looking at tapestries.

3638
03:30:49,420 --> 03:30:50,540
Did I miss a door?

3639
03:30:50,960 --> 03:30:51,900
I got too distracted.

3640
03:30:53,180 --> 03:30:53,920
Oh, yeah.

3641
03:30:54,020 --> 03:30:54,600
There was a door.

3642
03:30:54,720 --> 03:30:57,120
Sorry, I got- I was so distracted.

3643
03:30:57,380 --> 03:30:59,580
It was so beaut- The artwork was so beautiful.

3644
03:31:03,180 --> 03:31:04,980
I was looking at art.

3645
03:31:05,240 --> 03:31:06,700
Can you really blame me?

3646
03:31:12,920 --> 03:31:16,840
Oh, is this the portal to Yonheim?

3647
03:31:23,940 --> 03:31:25,160
I'm gonna hit it.

3648
03:31:26,100 --> 03:31:26,660
Oh.

3649
03:31:28,680 --> 03:31:31,200
Um, that was my entire plan, boy.

3650
03:31:36,420 --> 03:31:37,760
I'm out of ideas.

3651
03:31:41,160 --> 03:31:43,820
Boy, I'm out of i- Oh, sorry, nevermind.

3652
03:31:43,980 --> 03:31:47,960
I just- I have to just move this.

3653
03:31:53,000 --> 03:31:54,260
What did I do?

3654
03:32:01,940 --> 03:32:02,660
What?

3655
03:32:07,720 --> 03:32:12,740
Oh, and then we have a different- We have a different entrance way.

3656
03:32:17,070 --> 03:32:18,790
And then we have different portals.

3657
03:32:18,790 --> 03:32:19,350
Portals!

3658
03:32:19,350 --> 03:32:26,530
Oh my god, I- War trolls, but now they're stone trolls.

3659
03:32:28,290 --> 03:32:29,910
Oh, thank god, okay.

3660
03:32:37,690 --> 03:32:38,330
Huh?

3661
03:32:39,930 --> 03:32:40,710
Read.

3662
03:32:40,710 --> 03:32:40,790
Read.

3663
03:32:47,230 --> 03:32:48,490
What's that mean?

3664
03:32:59,890 --> 03:33:00,670
Okay.

3665
03:33:06,950 --> 03:33:08,210
Did you just do this?

3666
03:33:26,250 --> 03:33:26,690
Okay.

3667
03:33:26,830 --> 03:33:27,770
Alright, now we're downstairs.

3668
03:33:28,810 --> 03:33:29,670
Oh hey, more reading!

3669
03:33:30,430 --> 03:33:31,410
You like that, don't you?

3670
03:33:31,850 --> 03:33:33,030
That's your entire purpose.

3671
03:33:34,230 --> 03:33:36,370
And being fucking fashion insane, too.

3672
03:33:39,150 --> 03:33:40,030
Read.

3673
03:33:57,790 --> 03:34:02,590
But she has so many legs!

3674
03:34:03,530 --> 03:34:05,730
What was wrong- Are those legs?

3675
03:34:06,370 --> 03:34:09,410
Oh my god, no wonder he had so many children.

3676
03:34:13,500 --> 03:34:15,260
Uhhh, which way?

3677
03:34:15,360 --> 03:34:16,180
I'll go left side.

3678
03:34:20,200 --> 03:34:22,220
Oh my god, it's- Oh.

3679
03:34:23,180 --> 03:34:25,100
Oh my god, no.

3680
03:34:26,240 --> 03:34:28,920
No, not this again.

3681
03:34:29,080 --> 03:34:29,700
No.

3682
03:34:36,820 --> 03:34:43,440
I- I- I- I don't understand.

3683
03:34:45,760 --> 03:34:47,780
Do I have to time this?

3684
03:34:47,900 --> 03:34:49,800
Oh my god!

3685
03:34:49,860 --> 03:34:51,460
Okay, I figured it out.

3686
03:34:51,880 --> 03:34:53,920
I figured it out, guys.

3687
03:34:54,080 --> 03:34:56,000
I fucking figured it out.

3688
03:34:56,540 --> 03:34:57,160
Alright.

3689
03:35:03,700 --> 03:35:04,460
Alright.

3690
03:35:08,080 --> 03:35:08,840
Okay.

3691
03:35:18,840 --> 03:35:19,800
Okay, wait.

3692
03:35:20,520 --> 03:35:21,240
I'll wait.

3693
03:35:21,240 --> 03:35:21,320
Wait.

3694
03:35:27,610 --> 03:35:28,130
Alright.

3695
03:35:29,390 --> 03:35:36,530
This is- I'm fucking- I- Ooh, I'm gonna- I figured it out.

3696
03:35:37,610 --> 03:35:39,430
I just gotta line it all up.

3697
03:35:40,750 --> 03:35:41,430
Hey yo!

3698
03:35:42,850 --> 03:35:43,370
Yay!

3699
03:35:45,630 --> 03:35:46,710
Alright, where am I?

3700
03:35:47,930 --> 03:35:49,350
Okay, I need to grab the heals.

3701
03:35:49,450 --> 03:35:50,630
I fucked up the first time.

3702
03:35:53,730 --> 03:35:54,250
Ummm...

3703
03:35:54,250 --> 03:35:56,030
Okay, I need wind.

3704
03:36:00,730 --> 03:36:03,070
Wait, I'll grab this.

3705
03:36:04,070 --> 03:36:06,010
So I'm gonna put it here.

3706
03:36:09,910 --> 03:36:11,050
Guys, I told you.

3707
03:36:11,510 --> 03:36:14,670
It only took me four hours, but my head is expanding.

3708
03:36:14,830 --> 03:36:16,310
Oh my god, sorry, that's not what-

3709
03:36:20,370 --> 03:36:22,330
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3710
03:36:24,270 --> 03:36:24,730
Sorry.

3711
03:36:26,070 --> 03:36:27,510
That's not what I mean.

3712
03:36:30,510 --> 03:36:41,150
Okay, like I said, it- Okay, I'll- Like I said, it only took me- Okay.

3713
03:36:43,130 --> 03:36:44,910
Do we have to put this here?

3714
03:36:47,130 --> 03:36:48,330
Jesus Christ.

3715
03:36:50,330 --> 03:36:51,850
Put this here.

3716
03:36:57,190 --> 03:37:00,430
I- Okay, there we go.

3717
03:37:02,310 --> 03:37:03,050
Nice.

3718
03:37:05,310 --> 03:37:07,470
Let me grab this first.

3719
03:37:09,130 --> 03:37:12,590
Sorry, like I said, it only took me four hours!

3720
03:37:13,390 --> 03:37:17,650
And my brain has- It finally started revving up.

3721
03:37:21,230 --> 03:37:22,910
I told you guys.

3722
03:37:23,650 --> 03:37:24,750
I figured it out.

3723
03:37:27,210 --> 03:37:29,370
Aww, it's cutting time.

3724
03:37:35,090 --> 03:37:35,830
Yay.

3725
03:37:42,560 --> 03:37:43,100
Did I do it?

3726
03:37:46,460 --> 03:37:47,310
Did I do it?

3727
03:37:47,550 --> 03:37:48,230
Oh, I did.

3728
03:37:49,070 --> 03:37:49,690
Nice.

3729
03:37:50,490 --> 03:37:51,990
Oh, not nice.

3730
03:37:52,970 --> 03:37:55,150
Whoa, not nice, guys.

3731
03:37:58,640 --> 03:37:59,390
It's fine.

3732
03:37:59,990 --> 03:38:02,450
It's fine, I actually upgraded for once.

3733
03:38:03,630 --> 03:38:06,370
Oh my god, I'm so much stronger!

3734
03:38:07,210 --> 03:38:08,450
Wait a minute.

3735
03:38:09,210 --> 03:38:14,710
It's like I should have actually worked on my upgrades instead of hoarding.

3736
03:38:15,710 --> 03:38:18,750
Wait, why is this- Wow, it's like this game just got easier.

3737
03:38:20,210 --> 03:38:21,150
Is that troll?

3738
03:38:21,830 --> 03:38:24,170
It's god fucking- Okay.

3739
03:38:25,250 --> 03:38:26,350
I- Okay.

3740
03:38:27,890 --> 03:38:29,390
Okay, buddy.

3741
03:38:30,510 --> 03:38:31,150
Okay.

3742
03:38:33,410 --> 03:38:36,970
I was like, that sounds like a troll.

3743
03:38:40,870 --> 03:38:42,670
God fucking dammit.

3744
03:38:45,550 --> 03:38:46,770
Alright, there we go.

3745
03:38:47,130 --> 03:38:48,590
At least I made it over here.

3746
03:38:49,550 --> 03:38:53,850
Oh my god, when is it not a troll?

3747
03:38:54,270 --> 03:38:56,590
Why is it always trolls?

3748
03:38:59,210 --> 03:39:01,130
Can it be something else?

3749
03:39:01,290 --> 03:39:03,390
What if it's- Why can't it be a snake?

3750
03:39:03,970 --> 03:39:06,210
A really cool snake.

3751
03:39:08,730 --> 03:39:10,710
It's Norse mythology!

3752
03:39:11,010 --> 03:39:12,350
It can't all be trolls!

3753
03:39:14,110 --> 03:39:15,470
Oh, don't joke.

3754
03:39:15,470 --> 03:39:17,470
He doesn't know it was always trolls.

3755
03:39:22,580 --> 03:39:23,680
Alright, nice.

3756
03:39:26,180 --> 03:39:28,220
Okay, let's grab this.

3757
03:39:29,320 --> 03:39:32,300
And then... Why is this their boss music?

3758
03:39:32,360 --> 03:39:33,740
I literally just killed them.

3759
03:39:42,140 --> 03:39:43,720
Why is there still boss music?

3760
03:39:43,900 --> 03:39:44,460
I did it.

3761
03:39:48,830 --> 03:39:50,610
What am I supposed to do with this?

3762
03:39:54,050 --> 03:39:55,130
Do I have to go back?

3763
03:39:58,720 --> 03:40:01,780
Did I finish it too- Oh, it's the tempo music?

3764
03:40:02,880 --> 03:40:04,240
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

3765
03:40:08,030 --> 03:40:09,150
Is there no shortcut?

3766
03:40:10,030 --> 03:40:12,110
Do I have to go back via this?

3767
03:40:14,350 --> 03:40:15,750
Is there no shortcut?

3768
03:40:19,010 --> 03:40:25,010
Oh my god, I have to- Oh my god, I have to go back this way.

3769
03:40:25,630 --> 03:40:28,010
I have to do the slow way.

3770
03:40:28,470 --> 03:40:29,990
Are you serious?

3771
03:40:30,310 --> 03:40:33,870
Oh my god, and then he has to fucking try and block the way too.

3772
03:40:34,290 --> 03:40:34,950
That's fucked.

3773
03:40:37,270 --> 03:40:38,510
Okay, um...

3774
03:40:38,510 --> 03:40:39,190
Alright.

3775
03:40:41,490 --> 03:40:43,390
Is that a troll that I'm trying to beat up right now?

3776
03:40:43,670 --> 03:40:44,470
Is that- Okay.

3777
03:40:45,170 --> 03:40:45,890
No, it's not.

3778
03:40:46,010 --> 03:40:46,470
Thank god.

3779
03:40:46,550 --> 03:40:46,810
Okay.

3780
03:40:47,510 --> 03:40:50,050
I was gonna be like, I swear to god, why does he have so much HP?

3781
03:40:50,510 --> 03:40:55,950
I was gonna be a little angry.

3782
03:40:57,750 --> 03:41:00,990
Oh wait, I should use the ice because he's like fire, right?

3783
03:41:04,950 --> 03:41:06,270
That's right, type advantage.

3784
03:41:06,930 --> 03:41:10,210
Okay, maybe- I don't care about type advantage anymore.

3785
03:41:10,210 --> 03:41:16,360
I- Alright, nice.

3786
03:41:18,340 --> 03:41:18,820
Okay.

3787
03:41:19,720 --> 03:41:21,040
I wanna use the electricity.

3788
03:41:21,860 --> 03:41:24,620
I feel like lightning is stronger than whatever the fuck the blue was.

3789
03:41:26,340 --> 03:41:26,820
Nice!

3790
03:41:34,300 --> 03:41:34,780
Uh...

3791
03:41:35,340 --> 03:41:36,620
Where's the other chain?

3792
03:41:38,520 --> 03:41:39,480
It's this way.

3793
03:41:39,640 --> 03:41:40,880
Oh, we just gotta go this way.

3794
03:41:44,480 --> 03:41:46,420
Oh, whoa, that was close.

3795
03:41:48,060 --> 03:41:48,660
Alright.

3796
03:41:49,080 --> 03:41:50,480
Chain number two.

3797
03:41:56,940 --> 03:41:58,760
Chain number two.

3798
03:42:05,370 --> 03:42:05,970
What?

3799
03:42:06,410 --> 03:42:06,670
Oh.

3800
03:42:08,010 --> 03:42:09,270
Wait, that's a wind door?

3801
03:42:11,050 --> 03:42:12,850
I was not paying attention.

3802
03:42:14,290 --> 03:42:16,190
I thought it was just decoration.

3803
03:42:16,490 --> 03:42:18,190
I didn't realize that was an actual door.

3804
03:42:19,850 --> 03:42:22,290
I thought it was just a wall decoration.

3805
03:42:23,910 --> 03:42:31,130
Uh, I guess I gotta grab- Okay, I gotta grab this then.

3806
03:42:34,070 --> 03:42:34,710
Alright.

3807
03:42:38,050 --> 03:42:40,850
And then, since we're not coming back anyway.

3808
03:42:44,780 --> 03:42:46,700
Oh my god, it is a door!

3809
03:42:46,700 --> 03:42:46,800
Door!

3810
03:42:48,440 --> 03:42:49,700
Open sesame!

3811
03:42:54,080 --> 03:42:55,760
Havoc runic attack.

3812
03:42:55,920 --> 03:42:59,180
Wait, but my Hyperion slam is better, so it doesn't matter.

3813
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:03,820
Okay, back here I'll go.

3814
03:43:04,240 --> 03:43:04,660
Yay!

3815
03:43:08,580 --> 03:43:10,380
Alright, now the other chain.

3816
03:43:12,120 --> 03:43:13,140
Open the door.

3817
03:43:13,520 --> 03:43:13,860
Open.

3818
03:43:14,580 --> 03:43:15,360
Open the door!

3819
03:43:18,840 --> 03:43:19,440
Okay.

3820
03:43:22,580 --> 03:43:24,200
Oh shit, that scared me.

3821
03:43:26,600 --> 03:43:27,320
Wait a minute.

3822
03:43:29,560 --> 03:43:30,680
Wait a minute.

3823
03:43:32,080 --> 03:43:33,540
Oh, I can- Oh!

3824
03:43:36,520 --> 03:43:37,120
What?

3825
03:43:43,040 --> 03:43:44,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3826
03:43:44,240 --> 03:43:45,200
I can figure this out.

3827
03:43:45,960 --> 03:43:47,940
I time it perfectly.

3828
03:43:49,800 --> 03:43:51,140
Oh, I'm so smart!

3829
03:43:53,800 --> 03:43:55,400
Okay, but how do I- Okay.

3830
03:43:59,060 --> 03:44:01,580
Alright, now I got- Okay, wait, I fucked it up.

3831
03:44:01,720 --> 03:44:03,340
Sorry, guys, I fucked it up.

3832
03:44:04,660 --> 03:44:06,340
That's actually gonna get me killed.

3833
03:44:09,380 --> 03:44:12,860
Okay, I gotta modify the one at the end first.

3834
03:44:15,980 --> 03:44:17,000
Oh my god.

3835
03:44:17,040 --> 03:44:18,380
Okay, where's the end one?

3836
03:44:21,720 --> 03:44:22,540
It's this one, right?

3837
03:44:22,820 --> 03:44:23,220
No.

3838
03:44:27,730 --> 03:44:29,330
Okay, now they're all fucked up.

3839
03:44:29,390 --> 03:44:29,650
Whoops.

3840
03:44:31,410 --> 03:44:32,930
Okay, that's-

3841
03:44:37,810 --> 03:44:39,170
Okay, that's a little awkward.

3842
03:44:41,890 --> 03:44:45,070
Okay, I- Okay, give me a sec, guys.

3843
03:44:45,110 --> 03:44:48,030
I'm figuring- I'm figuring it.

3844
03:44:52,010 --> 03:44:54,110
Alright, now I figured this out, guys.

3845
03:44:58,280 --> 03:44:59,200
Here we go.

3846
03:45:00,100 --> 03:45:01,160
There we go, there we go, there we go.

3847
03:45:03,760 --> 03:45:04,720
And then...

3848
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:06,980
Oh, I figured it out!

3849
03:45:10,030 --> 03:45:11,210
Oh, I'm so smart!

3850
03:45:13,170 --> 03:45:15,450
I love reforcing things until it works.

3851
03:45:18,210 --> 03:45:18,630
Yay!

3852
03:45:21,190 --> 03:45:23,610
It always works, guys.

3853
03:45:23,910 --> 03:45:26,290
It just always works out.

3854
03:45:29,700 --> 03:45:35,380
If you don't understand, just keep trying until it works.

3855
03:45:35,480 --> 03:45:37,840
Wait, why is there an explodey thing here?

3856
03:45:39,920 --> 03:45:44,360
Wait, what do I- Why is there an explodey thing?

3857
03:45:49,140 --> 03:45:49,720
What?

3858
03:45:50,720 --> 03:45:52,900
Oh, that's why!

3859
03:45:55,560 --> 03:45:56,820
Yeah, it just keeps smacking.

3860
03:45:57,800 --> 03:45:58,700
Is that it?

3861
03:45:59,420 --> 03:46:00,660
Does it break?

3862
03:46:05,080 --> 03:46:05,760
Oh, shit.

3863
03:46:06,160 --> 03:46:06,900
I did it.

3864
03:46:07,180 --> 03:46:07,780
What happened?

3865
03:46:08,940 --> 03:46:09,440
Oh!

3866
03:46:12,140 --> 03:46:13,340
Is there more?

3867
03:46:13,700 --> 03:46:14,420
No.

3868
03:46:15,620 --> 03:46:16,300
Did I get crushed?

3869
03:46:16,560 --> 03:46:17,140
No.

3870
03:46:17,760 --> 03:46:18,420
Okay, nice.

3871
03:46:30,770 --> 03:46:31,290
Aww...

3872
03:46:32,110 --> 03:46:33,610
It wasn't that easy.

3873
03:46:33,950 --> 03:46:37,290
I was like, oh my god, I feel so smart!

3874
03:46:38,030 --> 03:46:40,230
Oh my god, I figured it out!

3875
03:46:40,290 --> 03:46:41,850
I'm so fucking smart!

3876
03:46:42,550 --> 03:46:45,430
Oh my god, so simple!

3877
03:46:46,950 --> 03:46:49,270
Holy shit, what a puzzle for babies!

3878
03:46:50,290 --> 03:46:51,690
But I didn't figure it out, guys.

3879
03:46:52,190 --> 03:46:53,610
I didn't figure it out.

3880
03:46:54,430 --> 03:46:56,010
Sadly, that wasn't it.

3881
03:47:00,910 --> 03:47:02,030
So I just...

3882
03:47:02,970 --> 03:47:03,570
Oh!

3883
03:47:04,230 --> 03:47:05,050
What the fuck?

3884
03:47:05,150 --> 03:47:05,990
I just ran.

3885
03:47:07,670 --> 03:47:08,170
No!

3886
03:47:09,450 --> 03:47:10,570
Okay, I'm alive.

3887
03:47:11,210 --> 03:47:12,810
Holy fuck, okay.

3888
03:47:13,370 --> 03:47:14,190
Okay, I'm alive.

3889
03:47:18,590 --> 03:47:20,970
Alright, stab this- stab this head.

3890
03:47:23,690 --> 03:47:24,850
Yay, we did it!

3891
03:47:31,910 --> 03:47:32,930
Is there anything else?

3892
03:47:33,030 --> 03:47:35,990
Oh yeah, read this before we summon another fight- a troll fight.

3893
03:47:41,530 --> 03:47:43,750
Alright, time to fight another troll!

3894
03:47:45,390 --> 03:47:47,210
I love fighting trolls!

3895
03:47:47,490 --> 03:47:49,410
It's my favorite time of the year!

3896
03:47:58,050 --> 03:47:59,290
Alright, where are the trolls?

3897
03:47:59,510 --> 03:48:00,050
I'm ready.

3898
03:48:00,750 --> 03:48:02,010
I'm fucking ready.

3899
03:48:03,010 --> 03:48:05,690
Oh, okay, clearly I was not ready.

3900
03:48:06,210 --> 03:48:07,910
Clearly, okay, clearly.

3901
03:48:08,630 --> 03:48:19,450
Alright, I was definitely not- Okay, alright, there's now other stuff I have to- Okay, that's it, I can't be bothered.

3902
03:48:19,750 --> 03:48:26,730
I didn't realize there was so much more than this.

3903
03:48:27,130 --> 03:48:30,110
So I'm just gonna- oh my god, I'm just gonna keep punching.

3904
03:48:34,050 --> 03:48:34,810
Okay, nice.

3905
03:48:36,310 --> 03:48:37,810
Nice, we got through the armor, guys.

3906
03:48:38,050 --> 03:48:38,710
You heard that?

3907
03:48:38,810 --> 03:48:40,210
Oh shit, okay, that's fine.

3908
03:48:41,790 --> 03:48:42,530
That's fine.

3909
03:48:44,710 --> 03:48:47,210
Okay, we gotta get rid of one of them at least.

3910
03:48:49,790 --> 03:48:50,590
Oh fuck!

3911
03:48:50,770 --> 03:48:54,330
Oh shit, I did not- It's okay, I still have my axe spin.

3912
03:48:55,030 --> 03:48:56,810
And I still have this special move too.

3913
03:48:57,710 --> 03:49:00,090
And then- oh fuck, okay, that's fine.

3914
03:49:00,090 --> 03:49:03,090
Oh, that's not fine, that's not fine, but that's okay.

3915
03:49:05,050 --> 03:49:08,630
Okay, that's- I'm just gonna grab this heal real quick.

3916
03:49:09,690 --> 03:49:12,730
And then- Oh, nice.

3917
03:49:14,230 --> 03:49:15,750
Wait, wait, that's not fair!

3918
03:49:17,530 --> 03:49:19,590
Just cause you have a shield over there.

3919
03:49:21,850 --> 03:49:23,170
Oh my god, please.

3920
03:49:25,050 --> 03:49:25,570
Please.

3921
03:49:26,350 --> 03:49:26,890
Oh god.

3922
03:49:27,890 --> 03:49:28,450
Oh!

3923
03:49:28,930 --> 03:49:29,830
It's okay!

3924
03:49:30,350 --> 03:49:30,950
Nice.

3925
03:49:31,630 --> 03:49:33,930
We did it, not even close.

3926
03:49:35,010 --> 03:49:36,650
Wait, I hear more people.

3927
03:49:37,730 --> 03:49:39,110
Where is that?

3928
03:49:40,930 --> 03:49:41,390
What?

3929
03:49:42,230 --> 03:49:44,070
Who are you shooting at?

3930
03:49:49,760 --> 03:49:50,720
Oh!

3931
03:49:56,800 --> 03:49:59,280
Yeah, come on!

3932
03:50:02,480 --> 03:50:05,000
I'm like, what is that sound?

3933
03:50:06,420 --> 03:50:08,060
Alright, nice, I did it guys.

3934
03:50:09,560 --> 03:50:12,440
I did it by doing nothing at all.

3935
03:50:18,210 --> 03:50:19,630
Alright, we just gotta run over.

3936
03:50:21,890 --> 03:50:22,330
Nice.

3937
03:50:22,830 --> 03:50:25,010
That was a little stupid, but like, hey, I'll take it.

3938
03:50:26,130 --> 03:50:27,170
I'll take those.

3939
03:50:28,310 --> 03:50:29,930
Oh no, where are they?

3940
03:50:32,490 --> 03:50:33,130
Nice, okay.

3941
03:50:34,690 --> 03:50:35,990
Okay, they're just mini guys.

3942
03:50:36,170 --> 03:50:37,010
It's not a troll.

3943
03:50:37,290 --> 03:50:39,090
They can't hurt you, they're not trolls.

3944
03:50:43,890 --> 03:50:45,970
They're not trolls, they can't hurt you!

3945
03:50:50,070 --> 03:50:50,970
Where is he?

3946
03:50:51,090 --> 03:50:51,750
Oh, he's over here.

3947
03:50:54,830 --> 03:50:57,450
Okay, I'm like scared I'm gonna get hit by the fire though.

3948
03:51:00,070 --> 03:51:00,550
Okay.

3949
03:51:00,870 --> 03:51:02,290
Oh no, not you!

3950
03:51:03,370 --> 03:51:04,210
Not you!

3951
03:51:07,810 --> 03:51:08,690
Oh shit, okay.

3952
03:51:09,230 --> 03:51:10,130
Okay, nice.

3953
03:51:10,950 --> 03:51:11,630
He can't hurt me.

3954
03:51:11,730 --> 03:51:13,470
Oh, I wonder where he is.

3955
03:51:14,590 --> 03:51:17,870
I wonder where the other guy is.

3956
03:51:18,030 --> 03:51:19,790
Wow, where could he be?

3957
03:51:20,510 --> 03:51:21,720
Okay, buddy.

3958
03:51:23,050 --> 03:51:26,190
Okay, you just get- Okay, buddy.

3959
03:51:32,730 --> 03:51:33,890
There's more?!

3960
03:51:35,130 --> 03:51:36,330
Where did he go?

3961
03:51:39,430 --> 03:51:41,930
Oh no, not that guy.

3962
03:51:44,190 --> 03:51:44,810
Nice.

3963
03:51:45,890 --> 03:51:47,790
Alright, I just gotta worry about him.

3964
03:51:50,650 --> 03:51:51,270
What?!

3965
03:51:51,270 --> 03:51:52,970
He can just do that?!

3966
03:51:52,970 --> 03:51:59,500
He just fucking hit through my fucking attack?!

3967
03:52:00,220 --> 03:52:01,200
Alright, nice, we did it.

3968
03:52:05,220 --> 03:52:06,840
Alright, flipping the temple!

3969
03:52:11,080 --> 03:52:12,060
Is it this way?

3970
03:52:12,460 --> 03:52:13,360
I don't remember.

3971
03:52:14,380 --> 03:52:14,980
It's here, right?

3972
03:52:18,080 --> 03:52:19,100
Or was it here?

3973
03:52:21,480 --> 03:52:22,360
No, it was here.

3974
03:52:22,400 --> 03:52:22,800
It was here.

3975
03:52:22,860 --> 03:52:23,220
It was here.

3976
03:52:23,380 --> 03:52:27,160
Oh my god, I'm getting so- I'm actually getting so disoriented.

3977
03:52:27,700 --> 03:52:30,160
They all look the same to me.

3978
03:52:32,180 --> 03:52:33,360
Where's my boy?

3979
03:52:35,020 --> 03:52:35,700
Boy?

3980
03:52:36,820 --> 03:52:37,660
Flip the temple!

3981
03:52:41,940 --> 03:52:43,920
It's time to flip the temple!

3982
03:52:48,100 --> 03:52:50,260
Oh yeah, it's the double tap shield!

3983
03:52:50,920 --> 03:52:52,420
I keep forgetting to double tap.

3984
03:52:58,320 --> 03:52:59,000
Yeah!

3985
03:53:00,580 --> 03:53:01,100
Yeah!

3986
03:53:01,820 --> 03:53:03,740
We can work together, guys!

3987
03:53:04,060 --> 03:53:05,040
We can do it!

3988
03:53:05,540 --> 03:53:06,700
I believe.

3989
03:53:07,720 --> 03:53:09,020
I fucking believe!

3990
03:53:09,340 --> 03:53:10,580
It can't be that difficult.

3991
03:53:11,740 --> 03:53:15,520
Alright, oh I have- Okay, I have the stronger one now.

3992
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:16,140
Alright.

3993
03:53:19,340 --> 03:53:22,000
I can upgrade the...

3994
03:53:23,100 --> 03:53:24,020
What was it?

3995
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:25,280
Oh yeah, throwing a rock.

3996
03:53:25,360 --> 03:53:26,580
I'm gonna learn how to throw a rock.

3997
03:53:33,260 --> 03:53:36,020
Alright, time to flip the temple!

3998
03:53:37,900 --> 03:53:39,280
Here we go!

3999
03:53:43,250 --> 03:53:43,930
Come on!

4000
03:53:44,290 --> 03:53:45,530
Push with your legs!

4001
03:53:47,990 --> 03:53:49,310
That's so cool.

4002
03:53:49,570 --> 03:53:50,330
That's so beautiful.

4003
03:53:51,550 --> 03:53:53,390
Oh my god, get rotated!

4004
03:53:55,710 --> 03:53:56,950
Get grappled!

4005
03:53:58,210 --> 03:54:02,270
Root force is always the answer, Meemer.

4006
03:54:04,750 --> 03:54:05,170
There!

4007
03:54:05,310 --> 03:54:06,210
On the left!

4008
03:54:06,590 --> 03:54:09,050
I think we can climb back up to the realm trap over there.

4009
03:54:11,230 --> 03:54:12,070
See that, Meemer?

4010
03:54:12,950 --> 03:54:14,330
Nobody can do all this alone.

4011
03:54:15,170 --> 03:54:18,790
All these obstacles are just chances to prove we're the ones who can beat them.

4012
03:54:19,890 --> 03:54:20,670
We may argue.

4013
03:54:21,410 --> 03:54:22,030
Me and Father.

4014
03:54:22,810 --> 03:54:23,530
You and Freya.

4015
03:54:24,310 --> 03:54:25,010
Brock and Sindri.

4016
03:54:26,090 --> 03:54:29,230
But when we all work together, we do make a good team.

4017
03:54:29,950 --> 03:54:30,910
And that's Tyr's test.

4018
03:54:31,570 --> 03:54:33,390
That's why we're gonna make a team.

4019
03:54:33,670 --> 03:54:35,270
Do you hear that, brother?

4020
03:54:35,730 --> 03:54:37,030
Lad's found his equilibrium.

4021
03:54:37,650 --> 03:54:38,470
What's that mean?

4022
03:54:38,910 --> 03:54:40,810
It means you speak wisely, Atreus.

4023
03:54:40,890 --> 03:54:44,230
Oh my god, you're becoming smarter, Atreus!

4024
03:54:44,410 --> 03:54:45,490
You're doing it!

4025
03:54:45,530 --> 03:54:46,850
You're using your brain!

4026
03:54:47,170 --> 03:54:48,650
I'm so proud of you!

4027
03:54:48,910 --> 03:54:49,810
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

4028
03:54:49,850 --> 03:54:51,150
Then he's gonna think I am.

4029
03:54:54,310 --> 03:54:55,090
Wait, what?

4030
03:54:56,050 --> 03:54:57,370
I can touch it now.

4031
03:54:59,470 --> 03:55:00,690
Boy, get over here.

4032
03:55:01,050 --> 03:55:02,550
It's time to touch this.

4033
03:55:03,190 --> 03:55:04,150
Wait, where did my boy go?

4034
03:55:05,870 --> 03:55:07,170
Wait, where is he?

4035
03:55:07,870 --> 03:55:08,310
Okay.

4036
03:55:10,810 --> 03:55:12,750
I don't wanna inflate his ego, guys.

4037
03:55:14,670 --> 03:55:17,530
I can only say I'm proud of him when I'm on my deathbed.

4038
03:55:17,990 --> 03:55:19,330
It has to have a built-up.

4039
03:55:24,130 --> 03:55:26,990
Only on my deathbed shall he know I'm proud of him.

4040
03:55:29,510 --> 03:55:30,410
What have we got?

4041
03:55:31,350 --> 03:55:32,950
Some sort of travel stone.

4042
03:55:33,630 --> 03:55:34,190
What is that?

4043
03:55:34,270 --> 03:55:35,590
Oh, is this the Stone of Yodaham?

4044
03:55:39,390 --> 03:55:42,850
Great Ardum Lazarus, that's the Unity Stone.

4045
03:55:43,950 --> 03:55:44,530
You know it?

4046
03:55:45,210 --> 03:55:46,790
I wasn't sure it existed.

4047
03:55:47,750 --> 03:55:51,830
If Tyr possessed this, that explains how he could visit all the realms.

4048
03:55:51,990 --> 03:55:52,930
How did he get it?

4049
03:55:55,070 --> 03:55:56,590
He held this.

4050
03:55:58,090 --> 03:55:59,530
In the panel at Odin's library.

4051
03:56:00,410 --> 03:56:00,950
Yes.

4052
03:56:02,830 --> 03:56:04,010
Yes, that's it.

4053
03:56:04,090 --> 03:56:05,630
I understand now.

4054
03:56:06,370 --> 03:56:09,330
It shows Tyr walking the realm between realms.

4055
03:56:10,030 --> 03:56:12,050
You know how he must never stray from the path.

4056
03:56:12,650 --> 03:56:16,530
Well, Tyr always followed his own path, if you catch my meaning.

4057
03:56:16,530 --> 03:56:17,750
So he made his own path.

4058
03:56:19,310 --> 03:56:20,710
With the Unity Stone.

4059
03:56:26,970 --> 03:56:28,170
Alright, let's use it.

4060
03:56:31,210 --> 03:56:32,610
Let's go to Yodaham!

4061
03:56:35,970 --> 03:56:39,470
So you're saying Tyr's shrine shows him stepping off the branch of the World Tree.

4062
03:56:40,170 --> 03:56:44,550
And you're thinking, to reach the secret path to Yodaham, that's what we need to do?

4063
03:56:44,930 --> 03:56:45,550
I am.

4064
03:56:46,790 --> 03:56:47,870
How do I use it?

4065
03:56:47,910 --> 03:56:49,530
That is what you're thinking, isn't it?

4066
03:56:53,710 --> 03:56:55,910
But how do I use the stone?

4067
03:56:56,110 --> 03:56:57,650
You need that alchemist for something.

4068
03:56:57,650 --> 03:56:58,350
Oh, here?

4069
03:56:59,750 --> 03:57:01,770
Wait, is there anything I can buy?

4070
03:57:01,770 --> 03:57:04,510
Okay, I just want to make sure I don't have anything to upgrade.

4071
03:57:06,310 --> 03:57:08,570
I guess not.

4072
03:57:09,370 --> 03:57:10,350
Oh, here's the last item.

4073
03:57:10,350 --> 03:57:11,910
Oh, there's the item I lost from...

4074
03:57:12,790 --> 03:57:14,250
The one troll... the other...

4075
03:57:14,250 --> 03:57:15,470
There's so many trolls, actually.

4076
03:57:15,750 --> 03:57:17,230
Which troll, Doki?

4077
03:57:17,510 --> 03:57:19,110
You've killed so many!

4078
03:57:19,550 --> 03:57:22,050
You gotta be more specific on the trolls!

4079
03:57:27,900 --> 03:57:28,460
Alright...

4080
03:57:30,580 --> 03:57:31,700
Let's see...

4081
03:57:31,700 --> 03:57:33,140
Can I travel there yet?

4082
03:57:34,940 --> 03:57:36,240
Where am I supposed to go?

4083
03:57:44,160 --> 03:57:44,720
Huh?

4084
03:57:50,950 --> 03:57:51,510
Here?

4085
03:57:51,810 --> 03:57:52,870
The Realm Between Realms?

4086
03:57:57,380 --> 03:57:58,700
It says this.

4087
03:58:23,510 --> 03:58:24,070
Anywhere?

4088
03:58:24,290 --> 03:58:25,510
Oh, I can pick anything?

4089
03:58:29,970 --> 03:58:32,390
Oh, it's... Oh, it's the Realm Between Realms.

4090
03:58:32,530 --> 03:58:33,270
Oh my God.

4091
03:58:33,810 --> 03:58:34,910
He literally said...

4092
03:58:35,650 --> 03:58:38,090
Dear, walk the Realm Between Realms.

4093
03:58:38,690 --> 03:58:39,870
Oh my fucking God.

4094
03:58:39,950 --> 03:58:41,730
Cause he made his own fucking...

4095
03:58:41,730 --> 03:58:43,010
Oh my God.

4096
03:58:43,290 --> 03:58:44,130
He made...

4097
03:58:44,770 --> 03:58:46,870
I'm making my path right now.

4098
03:58:47,110 --> 03:58:48,150
Sorry, I...

4099
03:58:48,750 --> 03:58:51,470
Sorry, I was in a coma for a second.

4100
03:58:53,530 --> 03:58:55,310
I got in a coma for a sec.

4101
03:58:58,230 --> 03:59:02,210
My hamster died on the wheel and I had to get a replacement.

4102
03:59:04,150 --> 03:59:04,710
Sorry.

4103
03:59:06,210 --> 03:59:08,170
My hamster died, guys.

4104
03:59:08,350 --> 03:59:11,030
I had to... That's why I couldn't figure it out.

4105
03:59:11,590 --> 03:59:17,350
He left his like... He left his records and my other hamster was reading through the records trying to figure shit out.

4106
03:59:30,290 --> 03:59:31,050
Oh yeah.

4107
03:59:36,470 --> 03:59:37,770
Oh, that's cool.

4108
03:59:38,430 --> 03:59:39,830
I mean, that's pretty interesting.

4109
03:59:53,410 --> 03:59:55,590
Oh my God, I already figured this out.

4110
03:59:55,650 --> 03:59:57,230
Why does he need to test me?

4111
03:59:57,710 --> 04:00:00,930
I'm already... Oh, I'm gonna use the bathroom before I do a stupid test.

4112
04:00:00,930 --> 04:00:03,990
My new hamster is still going through orientation.

4113
04:00:04,450 --> 04:00:05,250
I'll be right back.

4114
04:01:33,210 --> 04:01:34,310
And I'm back.

4115
04:01:34,890 --> 04:01:36,470
I'm back, guys.

4116
04:01:36,990 --> 04:01:38,370
Alright, let's go.

4117
04:01:38,770 --> 04:01:39,850
Let's do a stupid test.

4118
04:01:39,930 --> 04:01:40,910
My hamster is ready.

4119
04:01:42,670 --> 04:01:44,010
He's gone through orientation.

4120
04:01:44,370 --> 04:01:45,510
He knows what to do now.

4121
04:01:48,230 --> 04:01:49,210
What's this?

4122
04:01:49,710 --> 04:01:51,470
Alright, I'll grab one of the rage one.

4123
04:01:51,790 --> 04:01:52,870
I don't need the heals yet.

4124
04:01:55,570 --> 04:01:56,130
Alright.

4125
04:01:57,350 --> 04:01:59,190
I'm ready for my test.

4126
04:01:59,910 --> 04:02:02,890
Truly, it's just multiple questions, right?

4127
04:02:03,230 --> 04:02:04,710
I mean, like multiple choice, right?

4128
04:02:13,310 --> 04:02:14,430
Oh no.

4129
04:02:15,250 --> 04:02:15,830
What happens?

4130
04:02:17,150 --> 04:02:19,110
Maybe it's just multiple choice.

4131
04:02:22,110 --> 04:02:22,670
What?

4132
04:02:22,830 --> 04:02:24,650
Oh, it's just... Oh shit, whoops.

4133
04:02:27,470 --> 04:02:28,650
Oh wait, these are easy.

4134
04:02:30,710 --> 04:02:32,090
Wait, these are babies.

4135
04:02:33,210 --> 04:02:34,950
That's your fucking test?

4136
04:02:35,730 --> 04:02:37,630
This is for babies!

4137
04:02:39,090 --> 04:02:40,610
Oh shit, wait, he hit me.

4138
04:02:43,250 --> 04:02:44,930
Oh my god, I don't know what's going on.

4139
04:02:44,950 --> 04:02:46,110
There's way too many enemies, though.

4140
04:02:46,370 --> 04:02:48,550
There's way too many enemies around me.

4141
04:02:49,990 --> 04:02:54,730
They just keep coming and they just keep coming and they just keep coming and they just keep coming.

4142
04:02:55,790 --> 04:02:56,210
Nice.

4143
04:02:59,830 --> 04:03:00,430
Alright.

4144
04:03:01,750 --> 04:03:03,470
That was so easy.

4145
04:03:06,430 --> 04:03:08,350
Oh, are there gonna be trolls?

4146
04:03:08,750 --> 04:03:09,610
It's a gauntlet?

4147
04:03:09,790 --> 04:03:13,710
Oh my god, you know what that means.

4148
04:03:15,270 --> 04:03:16,750
What the fuck?

4149
04:03:16,870 --> 04:03:18,070
Oh, they're the...

4150
04:03:18,070 --> 04:03:18,770
Okay.

4151
04:03:19,490 --> 04:03:21,670
Oh my god, it's... Okay, they're the...

4152
04:03:21,670 --> 04:03:23,110
They're the elves!

4153
04:03:23,830 --> 04:03:25,790
Oh my god, it's been so long!

4154
04:03:25,790 --> 04:03:27,770
I almost forgot you guys existed!

4155
04:03:31,850 --> 04:03:33,090
Wait, what the fuck?

4156
04:03:33,150 --> 04:03:34,930
Oh no, he hit me, I can't see shit now.

4157
04:03:36,370 --> 04:03:37,410
I can't see shit.

4158
04:03:38,030 --> 04:03:38,710
Wait a minute.

4159
04:03:40,690 --> 04:03:41,690
No, that's all I wanted!

4160
04:03:41,770 --> 04:03:42,710
Okay, whatever, fuck it.

4161
04:03:44,450 --> 04:03:46,130
That's right, I'm just gonna beat you!

4162
04:03:47,150 --> 04:03:47,650
Fuck it!

4163
04:03:48,730 --> 04:03:52,290
The best way to kill a fucking bug is to punch it to death!

4164
04:03:53,630 --> 04:03:54,670
That's the only way!

4165
04:03:56,710 --> 04:03:57,610
Alright, nice.

4166
04:04:00,450 --> 04:04:01,450
Jesus Christ.

4167
04:04:03,510 --> 04:04:04,490
Oh no.

4168
04:04:04,770 --> 04:04:05,990
No, I can't see again!

4169
04:04:07,370 --> 04:04:08,790
Oh no, this is not what I wanted.

4170
04:04:09,650 --> 04:04:10,950
Oh, I can't see!

4171
04:04:12,830 --> 04:04:14,530
No, I didn't want to kill this guy!

4172
04:04:19,210 --> 04:04:21,150
Oh, I missed.

4173
04:04:21,370 --> 04:04:21,590
Whoops.

4174
04:04:24,750 --> 04:04:26,570
Oh, he'll be fine!

4175
04:04:26,570 --> 04:04:29,810
He'll be fine, he can't die!

4176
04:04:33,070 --> 04:04:34,790
I can't see though.

4177
04:04:38,070 --> 04:04:40,890
He'll be fine, he can't die!

4178
04:04:41,630 --> 04:04:43,850
Oh my god, but I can't see!

4179
04:04:47,650 --> 04:04:49,130
Jesus, I hate this.

4180
04:04:49,430 --> 04:04:49,530
I...

4181
04:04:55,180 --> 04:04:57,760
I can't, I can't, I can't!

4182
04:04:57,760 --> 04:04:59,440
Oh my god, I can't, I can't!

4183
04:04:59,580 --> 04:05:00,100
It's time!

4184
04:05:00,780 --> 04:05:01,760
Oh, it's time!

4185
04:05:01,900 --> 04:05:02,420
Oh, no!

4186
04:05:05,020 --> 04:05:07,640
I kept getting hit by the...

4187
04:05:09,290 --> 04:05:13,050
Oh my god, I can't deal with this shit.

4188
04:05:13,310 --> 04:05:14,710
I hate DLs.

4189
04:05:16,790 --> 04:05:18,550
Jesus Christ, I'm just gonna...

4190
04:05:20,150 --> 04:05:21,550
Oh my god, I'm...

4191
04:05:21,990 --> 04:05:23,570
He dodged the...

4192
04:05:23,570 --> 04:05:24,970
Okay, what a fucking waste.

4193
04:05:25,050 --> 04:05:27,850
I can't believe he fucking dodged the rock.

4194
04:05:27,930 --> 04:05:28,710
Like, what's the point?

4195
04:05:28,710 --> 04:05:30,750
He actually...

4196
04:05:30,750 --> 04:05:33,670
He dodged the fucking rock.

4197
04:05:35,810 --> 04:05:36,450
Okay.

4198
04:05:38,530 --> 04:05:40,730
Oh my god, are you fucking serious?

4199
04:05:40,810 --> 04:05:41,270
Where are you?

4200
04:05:41,690 --> 04:05:42,550
Where are you?

4201
04:05:42,850 --> 04:05:44,070
Where did you go?

4202
04:05:44,950 --> 04:05:45,790
Oh, no.

4203
04:05:46,170 --> 04:05:47,010
That's... okay.

4204
04:05:47,450 --> 04:05:50,290
That was so risky, I couldn't tell if that was actually him.

4205
04:05:51,410 --> 04:05:52,050
Okay.

4206
04:05:52,530 --> 04:05:53,090
Nice.

4207
04:05:54,290 --> 04:05:54,930
Again?!

4208
04:05:57,670 --> 04:05:58,650
I hate you.

4209
04:05:58,790 --> 04:05:59,370
I hate you.

4210
04:05:59,530 --> 04:06:00,030
I hate you so much.

4211
04:06:02,490 --> 04:06:04,510
Oh my god, I hate you.

4212
04:06:04,930 --> 04:06:07,170
I can't see you!

4213
04:06:10,690 --> 04:06:11,290
Alright.

4214
04:06:12,510 --> 04:06:13,870
Are you the low HP one?

4215
04:06:13,930 --> 04:06:15,010
You are, thank god.

4216
04:06:16,090 --> 04:06:17,830
And they get harder, right?

4217
04:06:19,330 --> 04:06:21,310
Oh my god, again?!

4218
04:06:21,930 --> 04:06:23,190
You fucker!

4219
04:06:24,630 --> 04:06:25,750
You fucker!

4220
04:06:26,450 --> 04:06:29,410
Oh my god, I can't see!

4221
04:06:33,470 --> 04:06:35,150
Oh my god.

4222
04:06:37,390 --> 04:06:39,890
Bro, I hate... oh my god, I hate these guys.

4223
04:06:40,050 --> 04:06:40,850
I hate these guys.

4224
04:06:44,750 --> 04:06:47,370
I actually hate these guys so much.

4225
04:06:51,020 --> 04:06:51,580
Okay.

4226
04:06:52,140 --> 04:06:53,040
That shit...

4227
04:06:53,040 --> 04:06:53,520
Are you serious?

4228
04:06:53,600 --> 04:06:54,880
Okay, I was gonna say, that doesn't hit?

4229
04:06:55,280 --> 04:06:55,640
That...

4230
04:06:55,640 --> 04:06:58,040
Oh my god, are you serious?

4231
04:06:59,800 --> 04:07:01,720
I can't, I can't, I can't deal with him.

4232
04:07:02,040 --> 04:07:02,860
I can't.

4233
04:07:02,960 --> 04:07:04,340
Boy, I need you to find him.

4234
04:07:04,560 --> 04:07:05,840
I don't know where he is.

4235
04:07:05,900 --> 04:07:07,200
I need you to find him, boy.

4236
04:07:09,760 --> 04:07:10,160
Okay.

4237
04:07:10,460 --> 04:07:11,680
Use the walls, use the walls!

4238
04:07:14,700 --> 04:07:15,800
Oh no, where is he?

4239
04:07:17,060 --> 04:07:17,840
Where is he?

4240
04:07:19,440 --> 04:07:19,840
No!

4241
04:07:21,500 --> 04:07:22,220
It's fine!

4242
04:07:22,220 --> 04:07:23,180
It's fine!

4243
04:07:25,530 --> 04:07:26,570
Okay, no.

4244
04:07:28,270 --> 04:07:28,750
No!

4245
04:07:29,530 --> 04:07:30,770
Just shoot him!

4246
04:07:36,760 --> 04:07:37,700
Yes, you are.

4247
04:07:37,920 --> 04:07:39,440
You were born ready, boy!

4248
04:07:41,080 --> 04:07:42,020
Yes, you are!

4249
04:07:42,060 --> 04:07:42,880
You're so ready!

4250
04:07:43,240 --> 04:07:43,560
You know what?

4251
04:07:43,560 --> 04:07:44,400
I'll just let him...

4252
04:07:44,400 --> 04:07:45,140
Oh shit!

4253
04:07:45,340 --> 04:07:45,580
No!

4254
04:07:49,940 --> 04:07:51,600
Oh my god!

4255
04:07:55,500 --> 04:07:56,400
I seriously...

4256
04:07:56,400 --> 04:07:57,020
I fucking...

4257
04:07:58,000 --> 04:07:58,760
Okay.

4258
04:07:59,600 --> 04:08:00,580
I can see now.

4259
04:08:00,980 --> 04:08:01,660
I can see!

4260
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:03,060
I can...

4261
04:08:03,060 --> 04:08:03,800
Oh no!

4262
04:08:04,220 --> 04:08:04,620
No, no, no!

4263
04:08:04,840 --> 04:08:06,760
He does so much damage!

4264
04:08:09,360 --> 04:08:10,880
Jesus Christ!

4265
04:08:12,620 --> 04:08:14,300
Okay, this one...

4266
04:08:14,300 --> 04:08:15,660
This one was hard.

4267
04:08:20,100 --> 04:08:21,460
Oh no!

4268
04:08:25,520 --> 04:08:26,480
Oh no!

4269
04:08:26,980 --> 04:08:27,100
Please!

4270
04:08:27,740 --> 04:08:28,080
Okay!

4271
04:08:28,420 --> 04:08:29,440
It's a lot better!

4272
04:08:29,580 --> 04:08:30,440
It's not the L's!

4273
04:08:30,680 --> 04:08:31,760
It's not the L's!

4274
04:08:31,860 --> 04:08:32,340
Thank god!

4275
04:08:34,320 --> 04:08:34,800
Okay.

4276
04:08:35,680 --> 04:08:36,400
They're not the L's.

4277
04:08:36,440 --> 04:08:36,840
That's fine!

4278
04:08:39,680 --> 04:08:40,060
Oh!

4279
04:08:40,640 --> 04:08:41,120
Nice!

4280
04:08:42,080 --> 04:08:42,780
I figured it out!

4281
04:08:43,280 --> 04:08:44,120
Guys, I learned!

4282
04:08:44,640 --> 04:08:45,820
I told you I could learn!

4283
04:08:46,120 --> 04:08:46,400
Oh!

4284
04:08:46,640 --> 04:08:46,880
Whoa!

4285
04:08:46,880 --> 04:08:47,120
Whoa!

4286
04:08:47,120 --> 04:08:47,220
Whoa!

4287
04:08:47,260 --> 04:08:47,540
Whoa!

4288
04:08:47,540 --> 04:08:47,800
Whoa!

4289
04:08:48,460 --> 04:08:48,600
Whoa!

4290
04:08:50,060 --> 04:08:50,460
Whoa!

4291
04:08:51,060 --> 04:08:51,120
Whoa!

4292
04:08:51,240 --> 04:08:51,300
Whoa!

4293
04:08:51,620 --> 04:08:51,640
Whoa!

4294
04:08:53,920 --> 04:08:54,020
Whoa!

4295
04:08:54,400 --> 04:08:54,800
Whoa!

4296
04:08:54,800 --> 04:08:54,900
Whoa!

4297
04:08:54,900 --> 04:08:55,360
Okay, nice.

4298
04:08:55,480 --> 04:08:57,200
I still have a power move.

4299
04:08:57,660 --> 04:08:58,280
That's good.

4300
04:08:58,840 --> 04:08:59,180
I...

4301
04:08:59,180 --> 04:09:00,120
Where am I?

4302
04:09:00,160 --> 04:09:01,020
I can't tell!

4303
04:09:01,280 --> 04:09:02,060
Where am I?

4304
04:09:02,080 --> 04:09:02,740
I can't tell!

4305
04:09:02,820 --> 04:09:03,660
Oh my god!

4306
04:09:03,740 --> 04:09:04,500
Where am I?

4307
04:09:04,520 --> 04:09:06,140
I actually can't tell where I am!

4308
04:09:06,900 --> 04:09:08,860
Please tell me there's heal somewhere!

4309
04:09:11,880 --> 04:09:13,220
Oh thank god, there is.

4310
04:09:16,760 --> 04:09:17,320
Okay.

4311
04:09:18,520 --> 04:09:19,380
Okay, nice.

4312
04:09:21,920 --> 04:09:22,240
Wow.

4313
04:09:22,500 --> 04:09:23,800
I still have axe moves though.

4314
04:09:25,220 --> 04:09:25,740
Nice!

4315
04:09:27,200 --> 04:09:28,140
Alright, good.

4316
04:09:29,080 --> 04:09:29,620
Last guy!

4317
04:09:29,720 --> 04:09:30,200
Last guy!

4318
04:09:30,580 --> 04:09:30,920
Woo!

4319
04:09:35,000 --> 04:09:37,060
Use your bow, boy!

4320
04:09:37,880 --> 04:09:38,760
Good!

4321
04:09:38,840 --> 04:09:39,960
And use your body!

4322
04:09:43,680 --> 04:09:44,140
Oh!

4323
04:09:45,720 --> 04:09:47,160
We did it!

4324
04:09:47,820 --> 04:09:49,920
We fucking did it!

4325
04:09:52,480 --> 04:09:54,320
There's more?!

4326
04:09:54,920 --> 04:09:56,560
Oh my god!

4327
04:09:56,600 --> 04:09:58,760
I know what that sound is!

4328
04:09:59,280 --> 04:09:59,940
I...

4329
04:09:59,940 --> 04:10:00,640
I...

4330
04:10:00,640 --> 04:10:01,440
Oh!

4331
04:10:03,120 --> 04:10:06,100
You know what's better than two trolls?!

4332
04:10:06,100 --> 04:10:07,900
Three trolls!

4333
04:10:08,640 --> 04:10:09,520
That's a king!

4334
04:10:10,020 --> 04:10:11,320
Let's go!

4335
04:10:13,320 --> 04:10:14,880
Oh my god!

4336
04:10:15,020 --> 04:10:15,800
That's a king!

4337
04:10:15,860 --> 04:10:16,220
Go!

4338
04:10:18,060 --> 04:10:19,580
Three trolls!

4339
04:10:20,920 --> 04:10:22,320
Oh my god, I love it!

4340
04:10:23,800 --> 04:10:27,680
Troll numbers 51 and 52!

4341
04:10:28,560 --> 04:10:29,580
Oh my god!

4342
04:10:29,580 --> 04:10:30,700
It's my favorite!

4343
04:10:33,290 --> 04:10:34,220
Thank god!

4344
04:10:34,340 --> 04:10:35,640
Always has been!

4345
04:10:35,780 --> 04:10:36,240
Doki!

4346
04:10:36,500 --> 04:10:38,300
Always has been!

4347
04:10:41,210 --> 04:10:42,620
Oh my god!

4348
04:10:44,100 --> 04:10:45,840
Jesus Christ!

4349
04:10:48,440 --> 04:10:50,760
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted to do!

4350
04:10:54,580 --> 04:10:56,720
I hate these trolls!

4351
04:10:56,720 --> 04:10:56,940
Run!

4352
04:10:58,940 --> 04:10:59,400
Okay.

4353
04:11:00,700 --> 04:11:01,160
Alright.

4354
04:11:02,200 --> 04:11:03,220
We got this.

4355
04:11:03,420 --> 04:11:04,760
Oh wait, he's a fire troll.

4356
04:11:04,900 --> 04:11:06,220
I don't know what I'm doing here.

4357
04:11:07,080 --> 04:11:09,100
But it's okay, I still have this attack too.

4358
04:11:09,860 --> 04:11:10,120
Go!

4359
04:11:11,520 --> 04:11:11,980
Nice!

4360
04:11:18,980 --> 04:11:20,060
Okay, he's almost...

4361
04:11:20,060 --> 04:11:20,560
He's so low!

4362
04:11:20,660 --> 04:11:21,240
He's so low!

4363
04:11:21,820 --> 04:11:22,700
He's so low!

4364
04:11:25,040 --> 04:11:25,980
Get out of here!

4365
04:11:25,980 --> 04:11:27,440
Get out of here!

4366
04:11:32,950 --> 04:11:34,250
That's fucking right!

4367
04:11:34,430 --> 04:11:36,310
I was molded by the trolls!

4368
04:11:38,170 --> 04:11:40,590
A slasher attack that protects Kratos.

4369
04:11:41,130 --> 04:11:42,390
What am I using right now?

4370
04:11:43,370 --> 04:11:44,410
Okay, my one...

4371
04:11:44,410 --> 04:11:45,790
The one I have right now is so much better.

4372
04:11:47,050 --> 04:11:48,230
Okay, did I do it here?

4373
04:11:48,950 --> 04:11:49,850
Did I do it?

4374
04:11:49,870 --> 04:11:51,110
Did I pass the test?

4375
04:11:51,410 --> 04:11:52,950
Am I worthy now?

4376
04:11:53,870 --> 04:11:55,590
I can't put the L's where the heart is.

4377
04:11:55,690 --> 04:11:57,770
Oh my god, that blind was so frustrating.

4378
04:11:58,690 --> 04:12:01,490
I'm pretty sure there was an easier way to fucking kill those L's.

4379
04:12:03,490 --> 04:12:05,450
But I'm too stupid to figure that out.

4380
04:12:10,230 --> 04:12:11,970
I'm gonna make sure I'm full HP.

4381
04:12:13,650 --> 04:12:14,370
Is that it?

4382
04:12:14,510 --> 04:12:15,270
Do I just leave?

4383
04:12:16,910 --> 04:12:17,930
Oh, I just leave.

4384
04:12:18,010 --> 04:12:18,930
Okay, I did it.

4385
04:12:31,590 --> 04:12:35,270
The giants secretly possess some remnant of primordial Yotnar creative essence.

4386
04:12:35,550 --> 04:12:37,250
The stuff all realms are made of.

4387
04:12:37,450 --> 04:12:40,510
The unity stone must have been fashioned from that essence.

4388
04:12:41,110 --> 04:12:45,450
To trust an outsider with it, even Tyr, tells you just how desperate they were.

4389
04:12:47,130 --> 04:12:51,510
Tyr's braziers, a symbol of the light that binds all realms together.

4390
04:12:52,210 --> 04:12:54,030
Why would he use those strange runes though?

4391
04:12:55,050 --> 04:12:57,770
Now you mention it, he wouldn't.

4392
04:12:57,770 --> 04:12:58,850
Oh.

4393
04:13:00,990 --> 04:13:02,770
Then who put it there then?

4394
04:13:03,950 --> 04:13:05,590
If it wasn't him, who could it be?

4395
04:13:08,050 --> 04:13:09,170
I'm gonna go this way.

4396
04:13:12,410 --> 04:13:14,670
Holy shit, that was hell.

4397
04:13:15,470 --> 04:13:17,250
That was absolute hell.

4398
04:13:23,860 --> 04:13:26,280
Those L's, those fucking L's.

4399
04:13:30,940 --> 04:13:32,760
Just wanna be sure if I have any upgrades.

4400
04:13:33,260 --> 04:13:37,600
Am I gonna find better armor or should I just upgrade stuff now, guys?

4401
04:13:39,940 --> 04:13:41,580
Cause I have a lot of money.

4402
04:13:51,070 --> 04:13:51,970
Oh, okay.

4403
04:13:52,410 --> 04:13:53,470
My armor can craft?

4404
04:13:53,970 --> 04:13:54,530
Woah!

4405
04:13:54,970 --> 04:13:55,750
I'm broke.

4406
04:13:59,750 --> 04:14:02,190
Sadly, I do not have the money.

4407
04:14:02,690 --> 04:14:03,450
I am poor.

4408
04:14:05,190 --> 04:14:07,930
Guys, we don't even have a home, guys.

4409
04:14:08,170 --> 04:14:09,430
I am very poor.

4410
04:14:09,750 --> 04:14:11,430
Oh, I should make him armor.

4411
04:14:14,900 --> 04:14:17,260
Wait, did I never give him armor?

4412
04:14:17,520 --> 04:14:18,560
Oh my god!

4413
04:14:19,980 --> 04:14:20,780
Wait a minute.

4414
04:14:22,060 --> 04:14:24,820
I just realized I never gave him clothes.

4415
04:14:25,400 --> 04:14:26,460
I never!

4416
04:14:27,320 --> 04:14:27,880
Whoops.

4417
04:14:28,860 --> 04:14:29,820
That's awkward.

4418
04:14:30,080 --> 04:14:30,960
Alright, there you go.

4419
04:14:31,880 --> 04:14:33,980
I never actually gave him clothes, guys.

4420
04:14:34,080 --> 04:14:34,680
But that's okay.

4421
04:14:34,680 --> 04:14:35,540
I learned.

4422
04:14:35,700 --> 04:14:36,780
Alright, I'll just upgrade this then.

4423
04:14:38,620 --> 04:14:40,660
I have the money, so I might as well.

4424
04:14:47,400 --> 04:14:49,040
I mean, it's purple now, so...

4425
04:14:49,640 --> 04:14:50,460
Eh, might as well.

4426
04:14:56,120 --> 04:14:56,480
Um...

4427
04:14:56,840 --> 04:14:57,700
Is that it?

4428
04:14:59,980 --> 04:15:01,900
Can I have a better pommel?

4429
04:15:02,060 --> 04:15:03,920
I feel like I haven't found a better one.

4430
04:15:05,140 --> 04:15:06,420
This is what, level 2?

4431
04:15:10,000 --> 04:15:12,540
Yeah, I haven't found a better pommel.

4432
04:15:17,750 --> 04:15:19,350
Wait, what?

4433
04:15:23,250 --> 04:15:24,250
Yeah!

4434
04:15:26,230 --> 04:15:27,990
Okay, uh...

4435
04:15:27,990 --> 04:15:30,230
I guess I should buy a better one.

4436
04:15:33,170 --> 04:15:33,670
Um...

4437
04:15:34,170 --> 04:15:38,310
Grant health burst on any successful precision throw.

4438
04:15:38,590 --> 04:15:41,850
On any successful executioner cleave.

4439
04:15:44,990 --> 04:15:47,530
The Elite Grip of... I should get that one.

4440
04:15:51,240 --> 04:15:52,520
Might as well get that.

4441
04:15:54,600 --> 04:15:57,160
Oh, and then...

4442
04:15:59,020 --> 04:15:59,500
Okay.

4443
04:16:00,020 --> 04:16:01,680
I feel like I'm always... I can get...

4444
04:16:01,680 --> 04:16:02,360
Oh, whoops.

4445
04:16:03,000 --> 04:16:03,980
That was a waste.

4446
04:16:04,920 --> 04:16:05,400
Let's upgrade.

4447
04:16:05,560 --> 04:16:06,460
Oh, I don't have...

4448
04:16:06,460 --> 04:16:07,320
World Serpent?

4449
04:16:07,540 --> 04:16:08,400
Snake Fragment?

4450
04:16:08,660 --> 04:16:09,800
Okay, we don't need that.

4451
04:16:10,320 --> 04:16:11,420
Alright, final...

4452
04:16:11,420 --> 04:16:15,140
I don't even know if it's final upgrades, but I might as well...

4453
04:16:15,140 --> 04:16:17,140
No wonder you did nothing.

4454
04:16:19,000 --> 04:16:20,840
Oh my god, whoops!

4455
04:16:23,740 --> 04:16:26,180
Oh my god, my son was so weak.

4456
04:16:26,580 --> 04:16:28,800
My son really was really weak.

4457
04:16:29,140 --> 04:16:29,620
Whoops.

4458
04:16:31,420 --> 04:16:34,740
Did not realize how weak my son was.

4459
04:16:34,920 --> 04:16:35,920
That is awkward.

4460
04:16:36,460 --> 04:16:37,840
That was very awkward.

4461
04:16:38,380 --> 04:16:39,720
But at least now I do.

4462
04:16:39,860 --> 04:16:40,360
Now I know.

4463
04:16:40,540 --> 04:16:41,180
Now I know.

4464
04:16:41,720 --> 04:16:42,100
Guys.

4465
04:16:42,800 --> 04:16:44,340
Now I have learned.

4466
04:16:47,900 --> 04:16:48,480
Alright.

4467
04:16:51,000 --> 04:16:52,700
Jotunheim, let's go!

4468
04:16:59,940 --> 04:17:03,200
It only took me 80% of the game to figure that out.

4469
04:17:04,540 --> 04:17:05,540
The next...

4470
04:17:05,540 --> 04:17:06,900
Jotunheim is the last section, right?

4471
04:17:07,940 --> 04:17:13,420
It only took me the last chapter to figure out about buying clothes for my son.

4472
04:17:17,010 --> 04:17:18,210
That's really it.

4473
04:17:18,850 --> 04:17:20,890
As long as I did it, it's fine.

4474
04:17:21,270 --> 04:17:22,530
I still did it.

4475
04:17:33,730 --> 04:17:34,810
Great, thank you.

4476
04:17:35,030 --> 04:17:36,190
I know, it was great parenting.

4477
04:17:37,650 --> 04:17:38,150
Wait, why?

4478
04:17:39,170 --> 04:17:40,430
What did I do wrong?

4479
04:17:46,070 --> 04:17:46,630
Huh?

4480
04:17:49,630 --> 04:17:50,650
Me too?

4481
04:17:50,650 --> 04:17:50,710
Me too?

4482
04:17:53,390 --> 04:17:56,250
Oh my god, we gotta kill Odin?

4483
04:17:58,350 --> 04:17:59,570
Yeah, what did we do?

4484
04:18:18,150 --> 04:18:19,870
Oh my god.

4485
04:18:19,870 --> 04:18:21,850
Why didn't they say anything?

4486
04:18:21,950 --> 04:18:26,270
They saw me carry a head around for like four months now.

4487
04:18:27,570 --> 04:18:32,110
And they didn't say anything about maybe perhaps knowing where the fucking eye is?

4488
04:18:36,090 --> 04:18:37,270
I never asked.

4489
04:18:37,390 --> 04:18:37,990
Oh, so true.

4490
04:18:38,070 --> 04:18:38,730
You're so right.

4491
04:18:38,970 --> 04:18:40,590
I never fucking asked.

4492
04:18:49,910 --> 04:18:51,070
Oh, does he have it?

4493
04:18:54,450 --> 04:18:54,690
Huh?

4494
04:19:05,250 --> 04:19:05,730
Oh.

4495
04:19:22,770 --> 04:19:23,210
What?

4496
04:19:23,670 --> 04:19:26,890
What was the statue?

4497
04:19:32,050 --> 04:19:33,770
Oh, it's the Thor statue!

4498
04:19:37,930 --> 04:19:39,990
Oh, so it's in my snake.

4499
04:19:44,610 --> 04:19:46,330
Oh, so I have to be inside him.

4500
04:19:46,370 --> 04:19:47,730
It's time to get void, boy.

4501
04:19:47,730 --> 04:19:49,390
Have we ever got void before?

4502
04:19:54,090 --> 04:19:54,730
Alright.

4503
04:19:57,250 --> 04:19:57,890
Huh?

4504
04:20:01,370 --> 04:20:02,390
Alright, boy.

4505
04:20:02,830 --> 04:20:03,910
It's time.

4506
04:20:04,610 --> 04:20:06,610
There's always a first time, guys.

4507
04:20:08,110 --> 04:20:09,430
Where is the snake?

4508
04:20:09,630 --> 04:20:10,510
Oh, there he is.

4509
04:20:11,230 --> 04:20:14,630
Mr. Snake, my boy has something to ask you.

4510
04:20:17,730 --> 04:20:19,150
Here, I'll go up though.

4511
04:20:23,750 --> 04:20:26,390
My boy is ready for his first time.

4512
04:20:27,470 --> 04:20:29,290
He's gonna become a man today.

4513
04:20:30,650 --> 04:20:32,470
The first step is to get void.

4514
04:20:36,330 --> 04:20:37,450
Toki, please.

4515
04:20:48,430 --> 04:20:49,610
Oh my god, you're right.

4516
04:20:49,690 --> 04:20:50,670
It's the year of the snake.

4517
04:20:52,710 --> 04:20:53,850
As per tradition.

4518
04:20:57,790 --> 04:21:03,470
It only happens every couple of years.

4519
04:21:04,930 --> 04:21:07,870
I'll pay you to never say those words again.

4520
04:21:09,250 --> 04:21:10,930
Thank you for the super chat.

4521
04:21:11,090 --> 04:21:12,150
Thank you, thank you.

4522
04:21:26,670 --> 04:21:29,930
Alright, guys.

4523
04:21:32,710 --> 04:21:35,090
Happy Lunar New Year.

4524
04:21:37,410 --> 04:21:38,990
As per tradition.

4525
04:21:44,810 --> 04:21:46,730
Remember this day.

4526
04:21:47,310 --> 04:21:51,230
恭喜發財,大家大利,身體健康.

4527
04:21:51,770 --> 04:21:53,770
As you go inside the snake's mouth.

4528
04:21:54,110 --> 04:21:55,010
Oh my god, I'm ready.

4529
04:21:55,010 --> 04:21:56,670
It's like a theme park ride.

4530
04:21:59,710 --> 04:22:01,730
You don't have to get void.

4531
04:22:03,110 --> 04:22:05,230
What a way to celebrate.

4532
04:22:07,810 --> 04:22:09,010
It's the year of the snake.

4533
04:22:09,510 --> 04:22:10,790
Of course I'm excited.

4534
04:22:11,490 --> 04:22:15,190
We can only do this once every couple of decades, guys.

4535
04:22:16,310 --> 04:22:19,250
You know how long it takes to get to the year of the snake?

4536
04:22:20,050 --> 04:22:22,230
It follows the... it's a cycle.

4537
04:22:23,690 --> 04:22:27,850
You know how many animals are in the fucking Lunar New Year calendar?

4538
04:22:28,570 --> 04:22:32,370
You only get to do this once every 12 years.

4539
04:22:34,130 --> 04:22:34,770
Guys.

4540
04:22:38,150 --> 04:22:39,150
As per tradition.

4541
04:22:41,430 --> 04:22:42,490
Alright, guys.

4542
04:22:42,530 --> 04:22:44,830
Before you go into the snake mouth.

4543
04:22:45,050 --> 04:22:47,230
During the year of the snake.

4544
04:22:47,230 --> 04:22:49,420
You gotta be like...

4545
04:22:50,690 --> 04:22:54,150
恭喜發財,大家大利,身體健康.

4546
04:23:00,690 --> 04:23:01,470
Alright,

4547
04:23:10,060 --> 04:23:11,360
where's my red pocket, snake?

4548
04:23:16,680 --> 04:23:18,600
Where's my red pocket, snake?

4549
04:23:19,740 --> 04:23:24,480
They say that once you go inside the snake's body.

4550
04:23:24,760 --> 04:23:27,280
You will be rained by a million red pockets.

4551
04:23:28,420 --> 04:23:28,740
Look, see?

4552
04:23:28,840 --> 04:23:30,920
It's also red for red pocket.

4553
04:23:32,440 --> 04:23:34,580
Where is the money?

4554
04:23:43,260 --> 04:23:45,020
Wait, wait a minute.

4555
04:23:45,020 --> 04:23:48,860
Did my boy just say I used to dream about being eaten?

4556
04:23:49,140 --> 04:23:53,020
Oh my god, I'm unlocking something in him right now.

4557
04:23:56,340 --> 04:23:56,900
Alright.

4558
04:24:01,910 --> 04:24:03,630
When does the magic start?

4559
04:24:03,990 --> 04:24:04,850
We're here.

4560
04:24:05,530 --> 04:24:08,790
If you don't appreciate it now, you'll never appreciate it.

4561
04:24:08,890 --> 04:24:10,010
You'll never be happy.

4562
04:24:14,550 --> 04:24:16,230
Oh hey, what's in here?

4563
04:24:23,710 --> 04:24:25,210
I got him, it's working!

4564
04:24:26,430 --> 04:24:28,790
My red pocket, look at that.

4565
04:24:29,630 --> 04:24:32,130
There's another red pocket right here.

4566
04:24:32,670 --> 04:24:34,950
Oh my god, I told you.

4567
04:24:35,530 --> 04:24:37,170
I told you guys.

4568
04:24:37,310 --> 04:24:39,730
Oh my god, is that a red pocket chest?

4569
04:24:40,530 --> 04:24:41,910
Oh my god.

4570
04:24:42,650 --> 04:24:44,790
Welcome to the year of the snake.

4571
04:24:45,230 --> 04:24:46,710
Thank you, Mr. Snake.

4572
04:24:50,790 --> 04:24:52,690
I told you guys.

4573
04:24:53,710 --> 04:24:57,750
Now we're gonna be so lucky and prosperous for the rest of the year.

4574
04:25:00,230 --> 04:25:02,450
Snake related, M color blind.

4575
04:25:02,590 --> 04:25:03,490
Is this red?

4576
04:25:03,950 --> 04:25:05,950
Thank you for the super chat, Solid Snake.

4577
04:25:06,270 --> 04:25:07,390
Thank you, thank you.

4578
04:25:10,150 --> 04:25:12,250
Thank you, Auntie Snake.

4579
04:25:16,890 --> 04:25:19,870
Oh my god, Auntie Snake got me...

4580
04:25:20,650 --> 04:25:22,150
Got me so much gold.

4581
04:25:26,570 --> 04:25:27,750
Oh hey, frog.

4582
04:25:28,770 --> 04:25:29,530
Wait, no, lizard.

4583
04:25:30,290 --> 04:25:31,070
Dead lizard.

4584
04:25:33,270 --> 04:25:34,690
Wait, what am I supposed to do here?

4585
04:25:38,060 --> 04:25:39,320
Oh, I went the wrong way.

4586
04:25:41,800 --> 04:25:43,200
Roku, thank you for the super chat.

4587
04:25:43,280 --> 04:25:44,220
Thank you, thank you.

4588
04:25:44,260 --> 04:25:45,660
Thank you for gifting a ship.

4589
04:25:45,740 --> 04:25:46,760
Thank you, thank you.

4590
04:25:48,640 --> 04:25:50,340
Wait, I was supposed to go here.

4591
04:25:50,500 --> 04:25:51,080
The fuck?

4592
04:25:51,420 --> 04:25:52,160
What do I do?

4593
04:25:56,270 --> 04:25:57,490
How do I get across?

4594
04:25:58,510 --> 04:25:59,710
Oh, it's here.

4595
04:26:00,450 --> 04:26:01,550
I didn't see it.

4596
04:26:01,670 --> 04:26:02,730
It was not yellow enough.

4597
04:26:03,630 --> 04:26:04,970
CB, thank you for the super chat.

4598
04:26:05,070 --> 04:26:05,810
Thank you, thank you.

4599
04:26:05,970 --> 04:26:09,050
Pinocchio changed since the last time I watched it.

4600
04:26:14,670 --> 04:26:15,950
What was closer?

4601
04:26:16,930 --> 04:26:18,170
How do I get out of here?

4602
04:26:20,650 --> 04:26:21,110
What?

4603
04:26:22,550 --> 04:26:23,670
Did I fuck it up?

4604
04:26:26,430 --> 04:26:27,770
Not gonna make that.

4605
04:26:28,130 --> 04:26:28,430
What?

4606
04:26:28,650 --> 04:26:29,790
How am I gonna make it?

4607
04:26:32,550 --> 04:26:33,750
So confused.

4608
04:26:39,620 --> 04:26:40,220
What?

4609
04:26:43,240 --> 04:26:43,840
Oh.

4610
04:26:45,800 --> 04:26:47,580
Sorry, it needs to be yellower.

4611
04:26:48,980 --> 04:26:50,980
Okay, that makes more sense now.

4612
04:26:53,620 --> 04:26:54,680
There we go.

4613
04:26:56,840 --> 04:26:57,400
Sorry.

4614
04:26:58,140 --> 04:27:01,160
It's really hard to see yellow in a giant red pocket.

4615
04:27:06,940 --> 04:27:07,500
Alright.

4616
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:10,640
There we go.

4617
04:27:20,240 --> 04:27:21,940
Oh, we go this way.

4618
04:27:23,000 --> 04:27:25,280
We go this way.

4619
04:27:25,740 --> 04:27:26,940
Wait, where do we go?

4620
04:27:27,020 --> 04:27:28,000
Where is it taking me?

4621
04:27:28,660 --> 04:27:29,860
Oh, we go this way.

4622
04:27:33,660 --> 04:27:34,900
Alright, up we go.

4623
04:27:35,000 --> 04:27:36,080
Wait, where did my boy go?

4624
04:27:36,760 --> 04:27:38,100
Oh, he's not gonna...

4625
04:27:38,100 --> 04:27:40,100
Oh, he's gonna magically teleport, right?

4626
04:27:41,360 --> 04:27:42,520
Where did he go?

4627
04:27:44,760 --> 04:27:47,440
Is he gonna climb up here by himself?

4628
04:27:47,860 --> 04:27:48,880
Oh, there he is.

4629
04:27:50,260 --> 04:27:51,540
Good job, boy.

4630
04:27:57,100 --> 04:27:57,620
Oh.

4631
04:27:57,620 --> 04:27:57,660
Oh.

4632
04:28:01,880 --> 04:28:03,220
Wait, more chests.

4633
04:28:05,540 --> 04:28:06,620
What's in here?

4634
04:28:08,340 --> 04:28:09,500
There's the eye.

4635
04:28:16,460 --> 04:28:18,440
What the fuck?

4636
04:28:18,540 --> 04:28:19,500
That's huge.

4637
04:28:20,500 --> 04:28:22,480
Looks like it's bigger than the eye socket.

4638
04:28:27,820 --> 04:28:28,680
Oh, wait.

4639
04:28:28,780 --> 04:28:29,760
We can take this home.

4640
04:28:30,060 --> 04:28:30,580
Yay!

4641
04:28:33,100 --> 04:28:33,620
Yippee!

4642
04:28:35,340 --> 04:28:37,440
Alright, time to roll back outside.

4643
04:28:38,560 --> 04:28:40,360
I'm gonna say thank you, Snake.

4644
04:28:49,720 --> 04:28:50,240
Wow.

4645
04:28:51,020 --> 04:28:52,620
It's nice that...

4646
04:28:53,140 --> 04:28:56,540
It's actually nice that, like, there was nothing in the way for this.

4647
04:29:01,240 --> 04:29:02,420
Isn't that great?

4648
04:29:02,800 --> 04:29:04,220
Nothing get in our way.

4649
04:29:05,180 --> 04:29:08,660
Just me and the boy inside a snake.

4650
04:29:12,710 --> 04:29:13,310
Alright.

4651
04:29:15,070 --> 04:29:15,670
Ah!

4652
04:29:17,830 --> 04:29:19,430
Oh my god, what the fuck?

4653
04:29:23,490 --> 04:29:24,690
Okay, that...

4654
04:29:24,690 --> 04:29:25,550
Maybe he...

4655
04:29:25,550 --> 04:29:27,370
Okay, maybe he had a little burp, guys.

4656
04:29:27,930 --> 04:29:29,590
He had a little burp.

4657
04:29:29,750 --> 04:29:30,270
It's okay.

4658
04:29:30,370 --> 04:29:31,850
No, no, nothing is wrong.

4659
04:29:32,110 --> 04:29:33,770
It's just indigestion.

4660
04:29:37,030 --> 04:29:38,870
Just a little indigestion, right?

4661
04:29:41,030 --> 04:29:42,450
What the fuck is going on?

4662
04:29:48,210 --> 04:29:49,330
What's going on?

4663
04:29:50,950 --> 04:29:51,990
Wait, who's hitting him?

4664
04:29:52,490 --> 04:29:53,750
Who's hitting the snake?

4665
04:29:55,330 --> 04:29:56,910
Heartburn is rough.

4666
04:29:57,230 --> 04:29:58,390
Look, it's just heartburn.

4667
04:29:58,770 --> 04:29:59,690
Don't worry.

4668
04:30:08,580 --> 04:30:13,760
Oh no, don't fall into that juice.

4669
04:30:23,750 --> 04:30:25,070
Use the shield!

4670
04:30:26,510 --> 04:30:27,630
That's alright.

4671
04:30:28,050 --> 04:30:28,930
You're a god.

4672
04:30:29,890 --> 04:30:30,790
What happened?

4673
04:30:31,210 --> 04:30:32,350
Wait, what?

4674
04:30:33,590 --> 04:30:35,110
What's going on?

4675
04:30:37,050 --> 04:30:37,950
Wait, no!

4676
04:30:46,110 --> 04:30:48,910
What happened?

4677
04:30:57,430 --> 04:30:58,830
Snake?

4678
04:30:59,170 --> 04:30:59,750
Snake?

4679
04:30:59,750 --> 04:30:59,990
Snake?

4680
04:31:01,290 --> 04:31:02,690
Snake?

4681
04:31:09,330 --> 04:31:10,030
Freedom.

4682
04:31:13,850 --> 04:31:14,870
Wait, is that Odin?

4683
04:31:16,150 --> 04:31:17,930
Oh no, it's...

4684
04:31:17,930 --> 04:31:19,230
Witch.

4685
04:31:42,370 --> 04:31:48,990
Oh, he's close.

4686
04:31:49,110 --> 04:31:50,130
Wait, he got out of Helheim?

4687
04:31:50,850 --> 04:31:52,410
How the fuck did he leave Helheim?

4688
04:32:04,350 --> 04:32:06,710
We know what you are, you fucking witch.

4689
04:32:06,890 --> 04:32:08,170
We know what you are.

4690
04:32:08,750 --> 04:32:11,930
You made my boy into a street witch streamer.

4691
04:32:15,250 --> 04:32:16,450
Oh, there he is.

4692
04:32:18,710 --> 04:32:22,030
Before I had to beat some sense into him.

4693
04:32:23,430 --> 04:32:24,370
You witch.

4694
04:32:29,750 --> 04:32:30,630
Any idea?

4695
04:32:30,890 --> 04:32:32,330
Any idea at all?

4696
04:32:33,330 --> 04:32:35,330
What you have cost me.

4697
04:32:37,270 --> 04:32:40,030
This is like Godzilla.

4698
04:32:48,460 --> 04:32:48,920
Mother.

4699
04:32:50,480 --> 04:32:51,740
I'm here.

4700
04:32:52,800 --> 04:32:54,120
Don't run away.

4701
04:32:58,040 --> 04:33:00,600
I'm not going anywhere, mother.

4702
04:33:02,240 --> 04:33:04,280
Oh, it's like a great family reunion.

4703
04:33:04,280 --> 04:33:09,360
I know that how you feel hasn't changed, but I want you to know...

4704
04:33:09,360 --> 04:33:10,340
How I feel?

4705
04:33:10,820 --> 04:33:12,860
How I feel.

4706
04:33:12,880 --> 04:33:14,040
Oh, Freya.

4707
04:33:14,880 --> 04:33:17,140
You said the F word.

4708
04:33:17,500 --> 04:33:20,180
Oh, that's a trigger for him, Freya.

4709
04:33:21,240 --> 04:33:22,920
Poor choice of words.

4710
04:33:24,100 --> 04:33:28,000
I rehearsed everything I ever wanted to say to you.

4711
04:33:28,020 --> 04:33:28,980
Every word.

4712
04:33:29,320 --> 04:33:33,560
To make you understand exactly what you stole from me.

4713
04:33:37,770 --> 04:33:39,130
But now...

4714
04:33:39,130 --> 04:33:40,130
I realize...

4715
04:33:41,370 --> 04:33:44,530
I don't need you to understand anything.

4716
04:33:45,010 --> 04:33:47,530
I don't need you at all.

4717
04:33:47,550 --> 04:33:48,610
Back off, Kratos.

4718
04:33:48,710 --> 04:33:50,370
This has nothing to do...

4719
04:33:50,370 --> 04:33:53,330
This path you walk...

4720
04:33:53,330 --> 04:33:53,890
Vengeance.

4721
04:33:55,230 --> 04:33:56,630
You will find no peace.

4722
04:33:57,890 --> 04:33:58,490
I know.

4723
04:34:02,950 --> 04:34:03,630
You...

4724
04:34:04,410 --> 04:34:06,110
I'll deal with you later.

4725
04:34:07,170 --> 04:34:09,630
But family first.

4726
04:34:20,130 --> 04:34:21,130
This again?

4727
04:34:21,750 --> 04:34:22,570
Oh, shit.

4728
04:34:23,910 --> 04:34:24,790
Oh, fuck!

4729
04:34:24,830 --> 04:34:25,870
I forgot how to deal with him!

4730
04:34:26,230 --> 04:34:26,930
It's alright!

4731
04:34:27,310 --> 04:34:28,110
Oh, okay.

4732
04:34:28,270 --> 04:34:30,510
I legitimately don't remember how to fight him.

4733
04:34:31,910 --> 04:34:34,150
I'm a little scared, guys.

4734
04:34:35,130 --> 04:34:35,690
Okay.

4735
04:34:37,490 --> 04:34:37,910
Oh, wait!

4736
04:34:38,070 --> 04:34:38,270
Wait!

4737
04:34:38,370 --> 04:34:38,450
Wait!

4738
04:34:38,510 --> 04:34:38,970
I was...

4739
04:34:38,970 --> 04:34:40,330
That's fucking right.

4740
04:34:41,330 --> 04:34:44,430
I just remember him being incredibly fast, so I'm a little scared.

4741
04:34:44,870 --> 04:34:46,530
I'm actually...

4742
04:34:47,050 --> 04:34:48,690
I'm very scared about that.

4743
04:34:49,110 --> 04:34:50,410
He is so fucking fast.

4744
04:34:50,490 --> 04:34:50,830
Oh!

4745
04:34:51,330 --> 04:34:52,510
That's fucking right!

4746
04:34:52,810 --> 04:34:53,830
Don't have my range!

4747
04:34:54,670 --> 04:34:55,450
That's right.

4748
04:34:58,050 --> 04:34:59,930
I will never stop fighting!

4749
04:35:02,010 --> 04:35:02,890
Oh, shit.

4750
04:35:06,250 --> 04:35:06,830
That's right.

4751
04:35:06,870 --> 04:35:08,590
I got the boy this time!

4752
04:35:13,470 --> 04:35:15,010
Okay, I'm not protecting...

4753
04:35:15,010 --> 04:35:15,470
Oh, shit!

4754
04:35:16,110 --> 04:35:17,470
Okay, but who's protecting me?

4755
04:35:17,870 --> 04:35:19,050
Who's protecting...

4756
04:35:19,050 --> 04:35:20,310
Oh, please tell him to stop!

4757
04:35:20,330 --> 04:35:20,730
Please!

4758
04:35:27,730 --> 04:35:28,530
Oh, no.

4759
04:35:36,930 --> 04:35:39,070
I won't let you hurt him!

4760
04:35:39,330 --> 04:35:39,730
No, boy.

4761
04:35:40,710 --> 04:35:41,470
Fine.

4762
04:35:41,950 --> 04:35:42,330
Stop!

4763
04:35:43,210 --> 04:35:43,970
No!

4764
04:35:45,830 --> 04:35:46,310
Atreus!

4765
04:35:47,330 --> 04:35:47,690
You're bleeding!

4766
04:35:47,690 --> 04:35:48,450
Oh, my God!

4767
04:35:48,710 --> 04:35:49,250
Breathe, boy!

4768
04:35:49,870 --> 04:35:50,250
Breathe!

4769
04:35:50,950 --> 04:35:52,310
Oh, my God!

4770
04:35:53,430 --> 04:35:54,770
Bro, help...

4771
04:35:54,770 --> 04:35:56,010
My blood.

4772
04:35:57,850 --> 04:35:58,610
What?!

4773
04:36:03,270 --> 04:36:05,550
What is that?

4774
04:36:09,260 --> 04:36:09,780
What?

4775
04:36:11,300 --> 04:36:12,700
I can feel this.

4776
04:36:18,200 --> 04:36:22,080
I can feel everything.

4777
04:36:23,780 --> 04:36:24,260
Oh, no!

4778
04:36:26,380 --> 04:36:27,420
No!

4779
04:36:27,860 --> 04:36:29,520
My son can feel...

4780
04:36:29,520 --> 04:36:30,000
Oh, my God.

4781
04:36:30,000 --> 04:36:31,500
He's feeling himself right now.

4782
04:36:35,140 --> 04:36:38,480
The small no in the background.

4783
04:36:49,970 --> 04:36:50,850
What?

4784
04:36:51,010 --> 04:36:51,330
What the fuck?

4785
04:36:51,410 --> 04:36:52,650
He's alive?!

4786
04:36:56,730 --> 04:37:00,270
That man just started fucking feeling himself.

4787
04:37:08,950 --> 04:37:11,610
Oh, the mistletoe!

4788
04:37:12,170 --> 04:37:13,690
Oh, my God.

4789
04:37:13,710 --> 04:37:14,970
I remember now.

4790
04:37:18,970 --> 04:37:21,250
Just let him enjoy life now.

4791
04:37:21,350 --> 04:37:22,430
Bro, he has to...

4792
04:37:23,510 --> 04:37:25,430
It's no longer November.

4793
04:37:26,130 --> 04:37:28,230
Merry Christmas, Baldur.

4794
04:37:32,350 --> 04:37:33,670
Merry Christmas.

4795
04:37:35,510 --> 04:37:37,310
It's December 1st.

4796
04:37:43,450 --> 04:37:44,310
Not so dead.

4797
04:37:44,310 --> 04:37:45,730
Well, thank you for the superchat.

4798
04:37:45,890 --> 04:37:46,310
Thank you.

4799
04:37:49,450 --> 04:37:51,850
Um, you can't stop him!

4800
04:37:56,750 --> 04:37:57,350
Oh,

4801
04:38:00,710 --> 04:38:01,230
my God.

4802
04:38:01,370 --> 04:38:03,350
Where am I supposed to look at?

4803
04:38:06,270 --> 04:38:07,210
Oh, shit!

4804
04:38:09,150 --> 04:38:11,170
He can feel them!

4805
04:38:13,670 --> 04:38:14,750
Oh, my God.

4806
04:38:14,870 --> 04:38:15,590
Oh, shit!

4807
04:38:17,390 --> 04:38:18,870
Oh, my God.

4808
04:38:18,950 --> 04:38:20,250
Please, let me...

4809
04:38:20,250 --> 04:38:21,350
Where is he?

4810
04:38:22,630 --> 04:38:23,730
Oh, my God.

4811
04:38:23,750 --> 04:38:26,070
This is a little rough for me right now.

4812
04:38:28,270 --> 04:38:28,870
Okay.

4813
04:38:29,510 --> 04:38:30,810
He's so happy.

4814
04:38:35,540 --> 04:38:36,740
Oh, my God.

4815
04:38:40,320 --> 04:38:41,800
Okay, I...

4816
04:38:41,800 --> 04:38:43,880
Lady, I don't think he wants that.

4817
04:38:44,060 --> 04:38:46,420
Lady, he definitely does not want that.

4818
04:38:46,420 --> 04:38:47,880
He now knows...

4819
04:38:47,880 --> 04:38:49,480
He now knows what it's like.

4820
04:38:50,440 --> 04:38:51,260
Oh, my God.

4821
04:38:51,320 --> 04:38:52,000
I let go of...

4822
04:38:52,000 --> 04:38:53,860
I let go of shield at the last second.

4823
04:38:54,100 --> 04:38:55,420
I let go...

4824
04:38:59,640 --> 04:39:00,340
It's fine.

4825
04:39:01,160 --> 04:39:01,700
Yes, I...

4826
04:39:01,700 --> 04:39:02,200
What do you mean?

4827
04:39:02,220 --> 04:39:03,060
I just parried.

4828
04:39:05,840 --> 04:39:06,740
Oh, shit.

4829
04:39:12,870 --> 04:39:13,350
Okay.

4830
04:39:13,870 --> 04:39:17,270
Lady, I don't think it's me that's being...

4831
04:39:17,270 --> 04:39:18,510
Lady, it's not.

4832
04:39:18,510 --> 04:39:20,630
It's the other way around, Lady.

4833
04:39:20,910 --> 04:39:22,250
Oh, my God.

4834
04:39:22,850 --> 04:39:24,410
Don't worry, Lady.

4835
04:39:24,710 --> 04:39:27,390
It's definitely the other way around.

4836
04:39:29,430 --> 04:39:31,690
He's like, stop hurting my boy!

4837
04:39:32,110 --> 04:39:34,670
I'm like, bro, he's beating the shit out of me.

4838
04:39:34,770 --> 04:39:36,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

4839
04:39:36,530 --> 04:39:37,350
I don't...

4840
04:39:41,370 --> 04:39:42,690
Stop hurting him!

4841
04:39:42,750 --> 04:39:46,230
As he like fucking pounds into my face right now.

4842
04:39:51,850 --> 04:39:53,450
Oh, my God.

4843
04:39:54,570 --> 04:39:55,550
I hear you.

4844
04:39:58,510 --> 04:39:59,430
Okay, nice.

4845
04:40:02,730 --> 04:40:03,250
Okay.

4846
04:40:04,950 --> 04:40:05,810
Oh, my God.

4847
04:40:05,910 --> 04:40:06,590
Are you serious?

4848
04:40:07,470 --> 04:40:08,010
There you go.

4849
04:40:09,570 --> 04:40:10,090
Stop...

4850
04:40:10,090 --> 04:40:11,970
Stop bullying him!

4851
04:40:12,090 --> 04:40:13,950
I'm like, you tell him to stop first!

4852
04:40:14,030 --> 04:40:14,550
What the fuck?

4853
04:40:14,890 --> 04:40:16,230
He hit me first!

4854
04:40:18,090 --> 04:40:19,110
That's right.

4855
04:40:20,270 --> 04:40:21,270
There you go.

4856
04:40:21,430 --> 04:40:22,090
I got the parry in.

4857
04:40:24,830 --> 04:40:25,550
Alright.

4858
04:40:28,070 --> 04:40:29,610
Oh, God, please!

4859
04:40:30,090 --> 04:40:30,550
Please!

4860
04:40:33,210 --> 04:40:34,830
Oh, my God, please!

4861
04:40:35,890 --> 04:40:36,930
Let me through!

4862
04:40:37,870 --> 04:40:39,090
Oh, my God!

4863
04:40:39,450 --> 04:40:40,510
Please, woman!

4864
04:40:44,850 --> 04:40:45,570
Okay.

4865
04:40:46,790 --> 04:40:49,610
Jesus Christ, I am...

4866
04:40:49,610 --> 04:40:51,130
I swear to God, lady.

4867
04:40:51,490 --> 04:40:52,510
I swear!

4868
04:40:53,050 --> 04:40:55,230
He has so much HP!

4869
04:40:55,550 --> 04:40:55,810
Please!

4870
04:40:56,470 --> 04:40:57,510
Please, yes!

4871
04:41:01,000 --> 04:41:02,310
Okay, nice.

4872
04:41:05,290 --> 04:41:06,230
Nice!

4873
04:41:14,740 --> 04:41:15,100
Oh!

4874
04:41:19,420 --> 04:41:20,200
He's just...

4875
04:41:20,800 --> 04:41:21,640
Please stop!

4876
04:41:21,740 --> 04:41:24,940
Can't you see he's just a harmless baby boy?

4877
04:41:25,740 --> 04:41:27,420
You think he was a super chat?

4878
04:41:27,840 --> 04:41:31,820
Oh, shit.

4879
04:41:33,980 --> 04:41:35,780
This is... This is only a flesh wound.

4880
04:41:37,440 --> 04:41:37,920
Atreus?

4881
04:41:44,760 --> 04:41:45,540
Oh, no.

4882
04:41:46,280 --> 04:41:46,760
Oh, no.

4883
04:41:46,780 --> 04:41:48,220
Am I soloing this now?

4884
04:41:56,180 --> 04:41:57,060
Oh, no.

4885
04:41:57,620 --> 04:41:58,580
This is bad.

4886
04:42:01,020 --> 04:42:01,960
This is bad.

4887
04:42:02,680 --> 04:42:03,300
Oh, wait.

4888
04:42:03,340 --> 04:42:04,000
No, he still helps.

4889
04:42:04,200 --> 04:42:04,600
Thank God.

4890
04:42:06,720 --> 04:42:07,660
I was gonna be a little worried.

4891
04:42:08,280 --> 04:42:08,960
Oh, shit!

4892
04:42:09,200 --> 04:42:10,320
I was gonna be very worried.

4893
04:42:13,500 --> 04:42:14,420
Oh, he...

4894
04:42:14,420 --> 04:42:15,960
Oh, my God, I'm uncomfortable.

4895
04:42:16,200 --> 04:42:17,520
He's way too into this now.

4896
04:42:19,740 --> 04:42:20,860
Oh, my God.

4897
04:42:21,420 --> 04:42:21,900
Guys!

4898
04:42:22,380 --> 04:42:24,520
He's a little way too into this.

4899
04:42:24,520 --> 04:42:27,180
I'm just trying to fight, bro.

4900
04:42:27,420 --> 04:42:30,140
Bro, I'm just trying to survive, man.

4901
04:42:30,300 --> 04:42:31,600
I don't know.

4902
04:42:33,080 --> 04:42:34,420
He's like, yes!

4903
04:42:36,000 --> 04:42:36,680
Very...

4904
04:42:36,680 --> 04:42:37,140
Oh!

4905
04:42:38,700 --> 04:42:39,280
Bro.

4906
04:42:40,080 --> 04:42:41,580
Bro, that ain't it.

4907
04:42:42,480 --> 04:42:44,860
Jesus Christ, I keep like...

4908
04:42:46,840 --> 04:42:48,520
I'm like getting the wrong...

4909
04:42:51,040 --> 04:42:52,880
I'm getting the wrong...

4910
04:42:52,880 --> 04:42:54,300
Wrong target.

4911
04:42:54,980 --> 04:42:56,360
Oh, where is he?

4912
04:42:56,820 --> 04:42:57,640
Where is he?

4913
04:42:59,380 --> 04:43:00,420
That's fucking right.

4914
04:43:01,500 --> 04:43:02,000
What?

4915
04:43:02,080 --> 04:43:02,860
Are you serious?

4916
04:43:04,520 --> 04:43:04,960
Okay.

4917
04:43:06,760 --> 04:43:07,260
Nice.

4918
04:43:07,540 --> 04:43:08,460
I got that in.

4919
04:43:10,040 --> 04:43:10,860
Okay, nice.

4920
04:43:12,720 --> 04:43:13,940
Alright, get over here!

4921
04:43:17,810 --> 04:43:19,190
Yeah, you feel that?

4922
04:43:19,450 --> 04:43:20,770
You fucking feel that?

4923
04:43:20,950 --> 04:43:22,210
But not in a pleasurable way.

4924
04:43:22,290 --> 04:43:23,710
Like, I need you to actually feel pain.

4925
04:43:23,710 --> 04:43:24,690
Like, not...

4926
04:43:25,450 --> 04:43:26,090
Like...

4927
04:43:26,710 --> 04:43:27,910
No, my baby!

4928
04:43:28,630 --> 04:43:29,930
Not the other way.

4929
04:43:33,270 --> 04:43:33,910
What?

4930
04:43:36,730 --> 04:43:37,370
Oh, shit.

4931
04:43:37,470 --> 04:43:38,030
Oh, okay.

4932
04:43:38,530 --> 04:43:39,110
I thought...

4933
04:43:39,110 --> 04:43:40,710
Okay, um...

4934
04:43:41,890 --> 04:43:42,530
Um...

4935
04:43:42,530 --> 04:43:44,910
Okay, now he's trying to do something else.

4936
04:43:45,750 --> 04:43:46,870
Oh, what?

4937
04:43:47,690 --> 04:43:48,850
I was like, oh, look.

4938
04:43:48,950 --> 04:43:50,630
They're having family again.

4939
04:43:52,270 --> 04:43:54,790
Bro, he's trying to kill you!

4940
04:44:03,380 --> 04:44:07,620
Stay away from my son as he walks to kill me!

4941
04:44:09,980 --> 04:44:10,780
Oh, my God.

4942
04:44:10,820 --> 04:44:11,620
Oh, my God.

4943
04:44:11,800 --> 04:44:12,620
It's this again.

4944
04:44:13,140 --> 04:44:13,800
It's...

4945
04:44:15,580 --> 04:44:16,600
It's again.

4946
04:44:17,960 --> 04:44:19,560
Oh, my God.

4947
04:44:19,800 --> 04:44:21,560
I hate this.

4948
04:44:21,560 --> 04:44:22,640
What's up, boss?

4949
04:44:23,100 --> 04:44:23,460
I...

4950
04:44:28,760 --> 04:44:29,460
Okay.

4951
04:44:29,820 --> 04:44:31,620
I'm gonna choke your son in...

4952
04:44:31,620 --> 04:44:32,280
Oh, never mind.

4953
04:44:32,400 --> 04:44:32,880
Guess not.

4954
04:44:34,820 --> 04:44:36,740
We're back to UFC now.

4955
04:44:41,580 --> 04:44:43,240
Shoot him in the dick!

4956
04:44:43,820 --> 04:44:44,560
Do it!

4957
04:44:48,780 --> 04:44:50,680
He can feel it all!

4958
04:44:55,470 --> 04:44:58,010
I'm surprised the giant still has his eyes.

4959
04:44:58,830 --> 04:45:01,010
Oh, that's cinematic right there.

4960
04:45:05,710 --> 04:45:06,270
Oh!

4961
04:45:16,580 --> 04:45:17,420
Come on!

4962
04:45:17,700 --> 04:45:18,260
Come on!

4963
04:45:18,280 --> 04:45:18,680
This is it!

4964
04:45:18,700 --> 04:45:19,600
This is your character arc!

4965
04:45:19,940 --> 04:45:20,720
Okay, never mind.

4966
04:45:20,820 --> 04:45:21,320
Guess not.

4967
04:45:34,200 --> 04:45:34,340
Jesus.

4968
04:45:37,280 --> 04:45:38,180
Oh, it's time.

4969
04:45:38,500 --> 04:45:39,780
Time to be angry!

4970
04:45:53,660 --> 04:45:55,880
Because I have Ragnarok to play.

4971
04:45:58,480 --> 04:46:01,060
Because I have to be in a second game, Baldur.

4972
04:46:01,100 --> 04:46:01,660
I'm sorry.

4973
04:46:06,200 --> 04:46:07,020
Oh, shit.

4974
04:46:10,430 --> 04:46:11,010
Wait, no.

4975
04:46:11,070 --> 04:46:11,530
That's fire.

4976
04:46:11,690 --> 04:46:11,910
Fuck.

4977
04:46:11,990 --> 04:46:12,910
Okay, I got confused.

4978
04:46:13,590 --> 04:46:14,630
Where is he?

4979
04:46:19,780 --> 04:46:21,100
Oh, shit.

4980
04:46:21,600 --> 04:46:22,700
Where did he go?

4981
04:46:23,340 --> 04:46:24,320
I'm so lost.

4982
04:46:26,920 --> 04:46:28,280
True, but...

4983
04:46:29,920 --> 04:46:30,980
Oh, fuck.

4984
04:46:31,080 --> 04:46:31,260
Okay.

4985
04:46:31,760 --> 04:46:32,300
That's fine.

4986
04:46:32,360 --> 04:46:32,820
That's fine.

4987
04:46:33,260 --> 04:46:34,440
Jesus Christ!

4988
04:46:36,900 --> 04:46:40,220
How long is this boss fight?

4989
04:46:43,080 --> 04:46:44,040
Where is he?

4990
04:46:45,740 --> 04:46:46,260
Oh, there.

4991
04:46:46,400 --> 04:46:46,660
Nice.

4992
04:46:47,660 --> 04:46:48,300
No.

4993
04:46:49,280 --> 04:46:50,660
No, are you serious?

4994
04:46:50,780 --> 04:46:51,420
I've got...

4995
04:46:51,420 --> 04:46:52,760
There's too much CC!

4996
04:46:55,800 --> 04:46:57,000
There's so much CC.

4997
04:46:57,080 --> 04:46:58,000
I can't see anything.

4998
04:46:58,260 --> 04:46:59,780
I actually can't see anything.

4999
04:47:05,320 --> 04:47:07,980
He wants to kill you, lady!

5000
04:47:09,740 --> 04:47:12,400
Oh, my God.

5001
04:47:13,560 --> 04:47:14,200
Okay.

5002
04:47:16,820 --> 04:47:17,180
Nice.

5003
04:47:19,120 --> 04:47:19,480
Nice.

5004
04:47:19,600 --> 04:47:19,760
Okay.

5005
04:47:25,280 --> 04:47:26,320
Are you serious?

5006
04:47:26,540 --> 04:47:27,180
Are you serious?

5007
04:47:27,280 --> 04:47:27,480
Okay.

5008
04:47:28,760 --> 04:47:29,120
Okay.

5009
04:47:29,300 --> 04:47:29,680
That's fine.

5010
04:47:34,520 --> 04:47:34,880
What?!

5011
04:47:35,300 --> 04:47:36,240
He can just do that?

5012
04:47:36,780 --> 04:47:38,160
He can just dodge like that?

5013
04:47:39,900 --> 04:47:41,000
No, no, no, no, no, no!

5014
04:47:41,060 --> 04:47:41,600
Oh, fuck!

5015
04:47:41,680 --> 04:47:41,860
Okay.

5016
04:47:42,360 --> 04:47:42,780
That's okay.

5017
04:47:42,820 --> 04:47:43,180
That's okay.

5018
04:47:43,240 --> 04:47:43,600
That's okay.

5019
04:47:43,640 --> 04:47:44,080
That's okay.

5020
04:47:45,040 --> 04:47:45,580
That's okay.

5021
04:47:45,640 --> 04:47:46,020
That's okay.

5022
04:47:46,020 --> 04:47:46,500
That's okay.

5023
04:47:48,160 --> 04:47:48,760
That's okay.

5024
04:47:48,920 --> 04:47:49,160
That's okay.

5025
04:47:49,200 --> 04:47:49,620
That's okay.

5026
04:47:51,420 --> 04:47:52,000
That's okay.

5027
04:47:52,160 --> 04:47:52,440
That's okay.

5028
04:47:52,600 --> 04:47:52,980
That's okay.

5029
04:47:53,280 --> 04:47:53,800
That's okay.

5030
04:47:55,620 --> 04:47:56,500
I think my...

5031
04:47:56,500 --> 04:47:58,080
I don't like how, like...

5032
04:47:59,420 --> 04:48:00,260
Oh, my God.

5033
04:48:00,300 --> 04:48:01,020
Are you serious?

5034
04:48:02,220 --> 04:48:03,900
I don't like how it cancels.

5035
04:48:04,380 --> 04:48:05,260
Oh, my God.

5036
04:48:09,420 --> 04:48:10,220
Jesus Christ.

5037
04:48:10,360 --> 04:48:11,500
I need to heal so bad.

5038
04:48:16,980 --> 04:48:18,740
Then make him stop!

5039
04:48:23,100 --> 04:48:24,100
That's right, son!

5040
04:48:24,360 --> 04:48:25,080
2v1 him!

5041
04:48:26,020 --> 04:48:26,820
That's right!

5042
04:48:31,050 --> 04:48:31,730
That's right.

5043
04:48:31,810 --> 04:48:32,230
That's right.

5044
04:48:32,430 --> 04:48:34,950
I don't need instructions on how to beat the shit out of you.

5045
04:48:35,010 --> 04:48:36,470
I don't need fucking instructions!

5046
04:48:37,570 --> 04:48:38,150
That's right!

5047
04:48:40,130 --> 04:48:41,030
Oh, my God!

5048
04:48:41,170 --> 04:48:42,510
That's fucking right!

5049
04:48:48,540 --> 04:48:50,250
Father and son combo.

5050
04:48:57,590 --> 04:48:57,990
Huh?

5051
04:49:01,190 --> 04:49:02,070
Oh, my God!

5052
04:49:02,430 --> 04:49:03,970
Happy Lunar New Year!

5053
04:49:04,410 --> 04:49:06,070
Year of the Snake!

5054
04:49:12,400 --> 04:49:13,220
Nice.

5055
04:49:22,290 --> 04:49:23,070
Do it.

5056
04:49:24,570 --> 04:49:25,210
Do it.

5057
04:49:33,990 --> 04:49:35,250
He's beating father.

5058
04:49:36,150 --> 04:49:37,170
Not a threat.

5059
04:49:40,590 --> 04:49:43,850
And then I'm gonna walk away and then, like...

5060
04:49:43,850 --> 04:49:46,130
He's gonna try and kill me and then I kill him.

5061
04:49:46,750 --> 04:49:48,250
I don't need your protection.

5062
04:49:52,780 --> 04:49:55,140
I'm so glad I don't say that.

5063
04:49:55,620 --> 04:49:56,240
No!

5064
04:49:56,660 --> 04:49:58,300
You ruined the moment!

5065
04:49:59,000 --> 04:50:00,380
You ruined...

5066
04:50:09,310 --> 04:50:11,190
Just kill him.

5067
04:50:11,990 --> 04:50:13,310
Help yourself.

5068
04:50:14,330 --> 04:50:20,920
Can you mother what I do or say?

5069
04:50:21,800 --> 04:50:23,120
You won't...

5070
04:50:23,700 --> 04:50:28,960
You won't stop interfering in my life!

5071
04:50:29,220 --> 04:50:31,460
I was just trying to protect you!

5072
04:50:32,200 --> 04:50:34,940
That's what all helicopter moms say.

5073
04:50:37,220 --> 04:50:39,380
I've played these games before.

5074
04:50:39,760 --> 04:50:40,000
I know.

5075
04:50:41,180 --> 04:50:42,560
But you're free now.

5076
04:50:42,560 --> 04:50:44,960
You have what you want.

5077
04:50:46,000 --> 04:50:47,700
Try to find forgiveness.

5078
04:50:48,020 --> 04:50:49,580
We can build something new.

5079
04:50:50,420 --> 04:50:51,180
No,

5080
04:50:55,980 --> 04:50:56,800
we can't.

5081
04:50:58,740 --> 04:51:01,860
Because I will never forgive you.

5082
04:51:04,700 --> 04:51:10,620
You still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me.

5083
04:51:10,820 --> 04:51:12,680
I have paid.

5084
04:51:13,280 --> 04:51:14,900
I thought he could... he's a god.

5085
04:51:14,900 --> 04:51:18,400
He has like a millennia to live through.

5086
04:51:21,140 --> 04:51:22,760
He's literally a god!

5087
04:51:23,100 --> 04:51:25,640
That alone will make you whole.

5088
04:51:28,520 --> 04:51:29,720
You've seen me dead.

5089
04:51:30,700 --> 04:51:31,940
We'll make things right.

5090
04:51:34,240 --> 04:51:36,160
I won't stop you.

5091
04:51:42,580 --> 04:51:44,260
I love you.

5092
04:51:44,260 --> 04:51:46,660
Arteus does not look like he belongs there.

5093
04:51:51,180 --> 04:51:53,260
What are you gonna do?

5094
04:51:54,860 --> 04:51:56,540
I love

5095
04:52:03,960 --> 04:52:04,180
you.

5096
04:52:07,160 --> 04:52:16,890
Why do you even care?

5097
04:52:17,270 --> 04:52:19,410
You could've walked away.

5098
04:52:20,610 --> 04:52:22,070
The Psygorians...

5099
04:52:22,610 --> 04:52:24,990
must be better than this.

5100
04:52:55,030 --> 04:52:55,910
Freya...

5101
04:52:55,910 --> 04:52:57,490
He chose this.

5102
04:53:02,590 --> 04:53:07,390
Why did he choose this?

5103
04:53:07,650 --> 04:53:08,830
He just wanted to feel!

5104
04:53:12,450 --> 04:53:13,990
I will parade...

5105
04:53:13,990 --> 04:53:16,210
your cold body...

5106
04:53:16,210 --> 04:53:18,030
from every corner...

5107
04:53:18,030 --> 04:53:19,810
of every realm...

5108
04:53:19,810 --> 04:53:24,110
and feed your soul to the vilest filth in hell!

5109
04:53:24,230 --> 04:53:26,210
That is my promise!

5110
04:53:26,370 --> 04:53:27,450
He saved your life!

5111
04:53:27,710 --> 04:53:29,650
He robbed me of everything!

5112
04:53:29,970 --> 04:53:30,590
What?

5113
04:53:34,430 --> 04:53:36,690
What a horrible mom.

5114
04:53:42,450 --> 04:53:44,530
You are just an animal.

5115
04:53:46,650 --> 04:53:50,450
Passing on your cruelty and rage, you will never change!

5116
04:53:51,930 --> 04:53:53,250
And you do not know me.

5117
04:53:53,910 --> 04:53:55,630
I know enough.

5118
04:53:57,570 --> 04:53:58,750
Does he?

5119
04:54:07,330 --> 04:54:08,130
Boy...

5120
04:54:08,130 --> 04:54:09,810
Listen close.

5121
04:54:12,210 --> 04:54:14,370
I am from a land called Sparta.

5122
04:54:16,210 --> 04:54:19,230
I made a deal with a god that cost me my soul.

5123
04:54:21,410 --> 04:54:23,370
I killed many who were deserving...

5124
04:54:26,510 --> 04:54:27,890
and many who were not.

5125
04:54:38,560 --> 04:54:40,280
I killed my father.

5126
04:54:42,500 --> 04:54:43,660
That was your father in hell.

5127
04:54:47,590 --> 04:54:49,010
Is this what it is to be a god?

5128
04:54:49,490 --> 04:54:51,810
Yes, and you shall kill me too.

5129
04:54:52,130 --> 04:54:53,070
Is this what it always ends?

5130
04:54:53,630 --> 04:54:55,010
The cycle continues.

5131
04:54:55,010 --> 04:54:57,030
Sons killing their mothers?

5132
04:54:58,310 --> 04:54:59,330
Their fathers?

5133
04:55:01,190 --> 04:55:01,750
Yes.

5134
04:55:01,910 --> 04:55:02,810
Oh, no.

5135
04:55:03,950 --> 04:55:06,230
We will be the gods we choose to be.

5136
04:55:11,690 --> 04:55:14,750
Who I was is not who you will be.

5137
04:55:16,890 --> 04:55:18,330
We must be better.

5138
04:55:27,000 --> 04:55:28,140
Sorry about your dead son.

5139
04:55:29,380 --> 04:55:30,400
Okay, bye.

5140
04:55:33,640 --> 04:55:34,240
Okay, bye.

5141
04:55:34,240 --> 04:55:37,660
This woman just threatened my life and she's just gonna walk away?

5142
04:55:39,200 --> 04:55:42,800
She's just gonna- She literally threatened our lives!

5143
04:55:44,580 --> 04:55:45,860
Okay, bye.

5144
04:56:01,050 --> 04:56:02,250
What the fuck?

5145
04:56:03,970 --> 04:56:04,710
I don't understand.

5146
04:56:05,510 --> 04:56:07,230
I know saving her was the right thing.

5147
04:56:08,150 --> 04:56:09,610
She seemed all evil at the end.

5148
04:56:09,610 --> 04:56:10,550
Not evil.

5149
04:56:11,210 --> 04:56:12,770
You killed her son.

5150
04:56:13,870 --> 04:56:14,590
Her son.

5151
04:56:15,270 --> 04:56:18,970
The death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily.

5152
04:56:19,310 --> 04:56:20,230
But he was gonna kill her.

5153
04:56:20,390 --> 04:56:22,090
She would have died to see him live.

5154
04:56:22,850 --> 04:56:24,550
Only a parent can understand.

5155
04:56:25,270 --> 04:56:26,590
So you'd let me kill you?

5156
04:56:26,850 --> 04:56:28,210
If it meant you would live.

5157
04:56:29,170 --> 04:56:29,590
Yes.

5158
04:56:30,270 --> 04:56:32,730
Look, there was no easy choice.

5159
04:56:33,330 --> 04:56:34,430
For anybody, brother.

5160
04:56:35,270 --> 04:56:37,910
But I think we can all agree you did the right thing.

5161
04:56:37,910 --> 04:56:40,930
The world's a better place with Freya in it.

5162
04:56:41,490 --> 04:56:41,950
Just...

5163
04:56:41,950 --> 04:56:44,330
I mean, I guess...

5164
04:56:44,330 --> 04:56:45,010
She'll come around.

5165
04:56:46,130 --> 04:56:47,470
Back to Tyr's temple, then.

5166
04:56:47,930 --> 04:56:49,170
One last time.

5167
04:56:50,690 --> 04:56:51,650
Jotunheim awaits.

5168
04:56:52,050 --> 04:56:56,430
One of them had to live and I guess like, you know, Boulder was already too far gone.

5169
04:56:59,350 --> 04:57:03,010
Boulder was definitely a little too far gone to fix after that.

5170
04:57:03,030 --> 04:57:03,790
Jotunheim would bring his cure.

5171
04:57:04,250 --> 04:57:05,210
Lies, I'm sure.

5172
04:57:05,990 --> 04:57:07,810
Why did Mistletoe break the spell?

5173
04:57:08,330 --> 04:57:11,950
Vanir magic is powerful, but its rules are slippery and elusive.

5174
04:57:12,270 --> 04:57:14,090
I'm sure it makes sense if you're a witch.

5175
04:57:14,310 --> 04:57:16,630
Oh, but it's also bloody tragic.

5176
04:57:17,310 --> 04:57:19,650
Boulder was the greatest gift Odin granted Freya.

5177
04:57:20,170 --> 04:57:22,150
The one thing she treasured from their marriage.

5178
04:57:22,790 --> 04:57:25,750
She only hoped to spare him pain and spare herself loss.

5179
04:57:26,530 --> 04:57:30,550
But such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions.

5180
04:57:30,770 --> 04:57:34,890
Okay, that's like... I don't... I think she's a terrible parent.

5181
04:57:34,890 --> 04:57:38,250
She was definitely way too controlling.

5182
04:57:38,930 --> 04:57:40,010
Like, what?

5183
04:57:40,370 --> 04:57:41,530
Spilled nothing?

5184
04:57:42,310 --> 04:57:43,150
At all?

5185
04:57:44,310 --> 04:57:47,250
What has she done that was good after that?

5186
04:57:51,090 --> 04:57:55,130
Yeah, I think saying she's a good parent was a little bit of a stretch there.

5187
04:57:55,810 --> 04:58:01,890
I guess like in comparison with all the other gods and all the other gods and stuff, it makes sense.

5188
04:58:09,670 --> 04:58:13,890
Yeah, I was like, in comparison to other gods, I was like, I mean, I guess like...

5189
04:58:15,030 --> 04:58:16,790
It's not... that's a very low bar.

5190
04:58:35,130 --> 04:58:41,330
Oh, he won Freya's trust, and she taught him some of her Vanir magic, another choice she would live to bitterly regret.

5191
04:58:42,690 --> 04:58:53,010
Sadly, despite his wise counselor's best efforts to persuade him that peace was the only true path to stave off Ragnarok, Odin never let go of his obsession with your nightmare.

5192
04:58:54,210 --> 04:59:00,390
The taste of Vanir magic led him to new forms of experimentation and new levels of depravity.

5193
04:59:05,080 --> 04:59:06,060
Oh, man.

5194
04:59:08,880 --> 04:59:10,060
That's rough, buddy.

5195
04:59:11,340 --> 04:59:12,160
That's rough.

5196
04:59:12,220 --> 04:59:14,260
I can't believe Odin love-bombed her.

5197
04:59:17,480 --> 04:59:18,600
Is this the right way?

5198
04:59:18,760 --> 04:59:19,780
No, I went the wrong way.

5199
04:59:23,350 --> 04:59:24,270
It's this way.

5200
04:59:24,790 --> 04:59:25,470
Wait, what?

5201
04:59:26,430 --> 04:59:27,610
Where is it?

5202
04:59:27,810 --> 04:59:28,590
Is it this way?

5203
04:59:30,030 --> 04:59:33,190
God, the navigation's a little confusing sometimes.

5204
04:59:33,190 --> 04:59:36,570
No, I'm too far... far from it.

5205
04:59:38,450 --> 04:59:39,570
No, it is this way.

5206
04:59:42,290 --> 04:59:43,470
Yeah, it is this way.

5207
04:59:47,750 --> 04:59:48,970
Alright, here I am!

5208
04:59:49,410 --> 04:59:51,270
It's time to go to Jotaheim!

5209
04:59:57,010 --> 04:59:57,450
Aww...

5210
04:59:58,290 --> 04:59:59,830
Okay, I got everything I need.

5211
05:00:02,650 --> 05:00:04,950
To Jotaheim we go!

5212
05:00:16,230 --> 05:00:19,710
Finally, no more trolls, guys.

5213
05:00:19,990 --> 05:00:21,010
We did it.

5214
05:00:21,930 --> 05:00:23,190
We made it, guys.

5215
05:00:23,490 --> 05:00:25,190
No more trolls!

5216
05:00:31,500 --> 05:00:31,870
Aww...

5217
05:00:44,060 --> 05:00:44,800
Jotaheim!

5218
05:00:45,160 --> 05:00:47,960
I could've went... Oh my gosh, I went the wrong way.

5219
05:00:52,860 --> 05:00:53,600
Yay!

5220
05:00:54,260 --> 05:00:55,440
No more trolls!

5221
05:01:06,520 --> 05:01:07,440
Oh!

5222
05:01:26,180 --> 05:01:28,540
It's like my own laser.

5223
05:01:29,680 --> 05:01:31,020
Oh my god.

5224
05:01:31,640 --> 05:01:32,440
That's cool.

5225
05:01:34,480 --> 05:01:35,220
Oh!

5226
05:01:39,590 --> 05:01:40,330
Jotaheim!

5227
05:01:42,830 --> 05:01:44,070
We're gonna do it!

5228
05:01:44,550 --> 05:01:48,870
We're finally gonna use all of this to spread your freaking mom's ashes.

5229
05:01:49,890 --> 05:01:51,430
Oh my god.

5230
05:01:53,250 --> 05:01:57,150
We did all of that just to spread her goddamn ashes.

5231
05:02:14,400 --> 05:02:14,640
Huh?

5232
05:02:16,100 --> 05:02:16,980
Oh my god, that scared me.

5233
05:02:16,980 --> 05:02:17,820
I was like, who is that guy?

5234
05:02:29,570 --> 05:02:29,810
Huh?

5235
05:02:43,170 --> 05:02:46,110
The guy's holding it sideways like a fucking football.

5236
05:02:53,830 --> 05:02:55,310
Oh my god.

5237
05:02:55,850 --> 05:02:57,370
I did all of that.

5238
05:03:01,010 --> 05:03:03,530
Just to spread her ashes.

5239
05:03:08,220 --> 05:03:11,980
I almost forgot that was the original goal in the first place.

5240
05:03:12,460 --> 05:03:13,300
What a journey.

5241
05:03:14,220 --> 05:03:15,920
It's time for the victory lap.

5242
05:03:21,020 --> 05:03:21,800
This is it.

5243
05:03:22,460 --> 05:03:23,200
This is it.

5244
05:03:24,600 --> 05:03:26,480
I'm ready to spread those ashes.

5245
05:03:27,800 --> 05:03:29,400
Surely that's it, right boy?

5246
05:03:30,060 --> 05:03:34,420
Surely, surely it's gonna be over now, right boy?

5247
05:03:46,070 --> 05:03:46,810
Oh my god.

5248
05:03:47,910 --> 05:03:48,670
Light mode.

5249
05:03:57,550 --> 05:03:58,270
Hello?

5250
05:03:59,450 --> 05:03:59,930
Huh?

5251
05:04:04,010 --> 05:04:05,790
I can see the highest peak ahead.

5252
05:04:06,350 --> 05:04:07,370
Right over there.

5253
05:04:11,740 --> 05:04:13,360
Is it really gonna be that easy?

5254
05:04:14,020 --> 05:04:15,440
Can we do it, Arteus?

5255
05:04:19,240 --> 05:04:21,900
Can we just walk over there?

5256
05:04:27,700 --> 05:04:29,160
Oh my god, it's over.

5257
05:04:35,380 --> 05:04:36,640
One last try.

5258
05:04:41,070 --> 05:04:42,200
What are you doing?

5259
05:05:04,030 --> 05:05:06,190
What are you doing?

5260
05:05:06,190 --> 05:05:07,310
Arteus, you fuck.

5261
05:05:07,370 --> 05:05:07,990
Oh shit.

5262
05:05:08,190 --> 05:05:09,450
Arteus, you fuck.

5263
05:05:10,530 --> 05:05:13,170
Your dad's having a moment.

5264
05:05:14,930 --> 05:05:16,850
Boy, please.

5265
05:05:25,370 --> 05:05:28,010
It's called God of War, not Son of War.

5266
05:05:47,280 --> 05:05:48,300
Oh, it's back.

5267
05:05:48,580 --> 05:05:49,840
My chain's back already.

5268
05:05:50,180 --> 05:05:52,200
What the fuck, it just magically appeared back.

5269
05:05:54,620 --> 05:05:56,220
Alright, here we go, boy.

5270
05:05:58,300 --> 05:06:00,380
We're doing our victory lap right now.

5271
05:06:03,360 --> 05:06:04,440
Oh my god.

5272
05:06:05,540 --> 05:06:06,460
It's over here.

5273
05:06:08,580 --> 05:06:12,440
Every time I see these type poses, all I can think about is the point image.

5274
05:06:12,500 --> 05:06:13,060
Did you see it?

5275
05:06:18,200 --> 05:06:20,480
Yeah, it's over there.

5276
05:06:26,560 --> 05:06:28,600
What are they pointing at?

5277
05:06:32,720 --> 05:06:33,720
What?

5278
05:06:33,820 --> 05:06:43,260
What temple is this?

5279
05:06:43,260 --> 05:06:46,380
What are they all pointing at?

5280
05:07:04,410 --> 05:07:05,250
Is

5281
05:07:08,920 --> 05:07:11,080
it pointing towards this hole?

5282
05:07:14,970 --> 05:07:15,730
Oh.

5283
05:07:34,220 --> 05:07:35,420
Breed, boy.

5284
05:07:36,940 --> 05:07:37,540
Max?

5285
05:07:37,940 --> 05:07:39,580
Wait, is that my dead mom?

5286
05:07:39,840 --> 05:07:40,300
Or wife?

5287
05:07:50,380 --> 05:07:52,700
Boy, she was a giant.

5288
05:07:53,920 --> 05:07:56,580
And by God...

5289
05:07:56,580 --> 05:07:58,200
She was beautiful.

5290
05:07:59,940 --> 05:08:00,740
Wait, what?

5291
05:08:01,920 --> 05:08:02,740
Yeah, how?

5292
05:08:02,940 --> 05:08:03,760
Oh, is this a prophecy?

5293
05:08:05,940 --> 05:08:06,920
What the fuck?

5294
05:08:07,000 --> 05:08:07,500
Wait, what?

5295
05:08:16,480 --> 05:08:18,280
Oh, so she knew she was gonna die.

5296
05:08:22,700 --> 05:08:23,900
All these drawings.

5297
05:08:25,960 --> 05:08:27,860
This is our story.

5298
05:08:28,760 --> 05:08:29,160
No.

5299
05:08:31,860 --> 05:08:33,520
This is your story.

5300
05:08:34,180 --> 05:08:34,420
Huh?

5301
05:08:37,120 --> 05:08:37,840
But...

5302
05:08:37,840 --> 05:08:39,440
What does it all mean?

5303
05:08:40,240 --> 05:08:42,760
That I was not the only parent with secrets.

5304
05:08:48,140 --> 05:08:49,380
You didn't know.

5305
05:08:51,900 --> 05:08:53,240
She was a giant.

5306
05:08:53,240 --> 05:08:55,980
I'm a

5307
05:09:01,000 --> 05:09:01,460
giant.

5308
05:09:06,890 --> 05:09:08,170
Why didn't she tell us?

5309
05:09:12,400 --> 05:09:15,540
She sent us here knowing we would find this.

5310
05:09:18,220 --> 05:09:20,200
But... why not just tell us the truth?

5311
05:09:20,840 --> 05:09:22,400
Your mother would have had good reasons.

5312
05:09:25,560 --> 05:09:27,740
I feel like it would have changed his future if she told him.

5313
05:09:28,740 --> 05:09:32,180
Was sent to find...

5314
05:09:32,180 --> 05:09:32,800
Her?

5315
05:09:35,360 --> 05:09:38,200
Why was he tracking...

5316
05:09:38,200 --> 05:09:39,360
Her?

5317
05:10:00,170 --> 05:10:01,750
Yes, we are.

5318
05:10:03,350 --> 05:10:04,490
Oh, wait.

5319
05:10:04,690 --> 05:10:06,470
What the fuck is that?

5320
05:10:08,790 --> 05:10:10,270
Wait a minute.

5321
05:10:11,010 --> 05:10:16,490
Boy, um... we are missing some important information on that end.

5322
05:10:21,170 --> 05:10:24,930
Oh, hey, that looks like some foreshadowing over here.

5323
05:10:26,210 --> 05:10:26,890
Um...

5324
05:10:35,550 --> 05:10:36,230
Hmm...

5325
05:10:36,230 --> 05:10:39,650
I feel like something's gonna happen.

5326
05:10:41,070 --> 05:10:42,830
Who was that?

5327
05:10:44,290 --> 05:10:46,150
Look, it's Mother's.

5328
05:10:46,810 --> 05:10:47,650
She was here.

5329
05:10:48,630 --> 05:10:50,830
She saw every step we took before we took it.

5330
05:10:51,590 --> 05:10:53,130
Like she was always with us.

5331
05:10:54,230 --> 05:10:55,270
Watching over us.

5332
05:10:56,410 --> 05:10:57,050
Leading us home.

5333
05:10:58,890 --> 05:11:00,070
Let's finish it.

5334
05:11:06,170 --> 05:11:07,070
Alright.

5335
05:11:07,790 --> 05:11:09,490
I'm gonna spread those ashes.

5336
05:11:14,200 --> 05:11:15,540
Alright, son.

5337
05:11:16,060 --> 05:11:17,520
It's been four months.

5338
05:11:17,840 --> 05:11:19,360
We're finally here.

5339
05:11:20,320 --> 05:11:22,980
To spread your lying mother's ashes.

5340
05:11:24,140 --> 05:11:25,380
Wait, there's a giant hand.

5341
05:11:54,180 --> 05:11:57,440
He called him son instead of boy!

5342
05:12:00,400 --> 05:12:02,220
Oh my god.

5343
05:12:03,780 --> 05:12:05,120
Character development.

5344
05:12:16,290 --> 05:12:19,690
Yeah, that's definitely not like a normal mortal's ashes.

5345
05:12:19,890 --> 05:12:21,410
I feel like if...

5346
05:12:21,410 --> 05:12:25,570
If I burned my wife and her ashes started fucking sparkling...

5347
05:12:25,570 --> 05:12:26,830
I'd be like...

5348
05:12:26,830 --> 05:12:27,730
She's hiding something.

5349
05:12:27,770 --> 05:12:29,170
She was definitely hiding something.

5350
05:12:29,750 --> 05:12:30,430
Just...

5351
05:12:30,430 --> 05:12:31,810
I just...

5352
05:12:31,810 --> 05:12:33,090
I don't know.

5353
05:12:34,210 --> 05:12:34,890
Yeah.

5354
05:12:37,030 --> 05:12:38,010
Like, huh.

5355
05:12:39,790 --> 05:12:42,370
It's weird that her fucking ashes are sparkly.

5356
05:13:00,920 --> 05:13:01,680
Goodbye, Faye.

5357
05:13:01,780 --> 05:13:02,740
Oh, it's Faye!

5358
05:13:03,040 --> 05:13:03,860
I forgot it was Faye.

5359
05:13:31,700 --> 05:13:33,420
Where the fuck is the mortal part?

5360
05:13:49,120 --> 05:13:49,660
What?!

5361
05:13:53,820 --> 05:13:54,360
What?!

5362
05:13:59,740 --> 05:14:00,840
Oh no.

5363
05:14:01,100 --> 05:14:02,820
Oh no, he's gonna...

5364
05:14:02,820 --> 05:14:04,260
No, I told him not to...

5365
05:14:11,290 --> 05:14:11,690
Different!

5366
05:14:14,790 --> 05:14:15,890
No way!

5367
05:14:18,810 --> 05:14:20,990
Your powers are...

5368
05:14:20,990 --> 05:14:21,610
No!

5369
05:14:22,750 --> 05:14:25,570
I told him to be a different god!

5370
05:14:25,570 --> 05:14:28,830
I don't...

5371
05:14:33,820 --> 05:14:38,420
I gotta grow up to be a fucking freak!

5372
05:14:39,180 --> 05:14:43,010
Stop it!

5373
05:14:43,490 --> 05:14:45,410
I can't even stop!

5374
05:14:57,590 --> 05:15:00,590
His mother and nurse is laughing.

5375
05:15:00,590 --> 05:15:02,350
Oh my god, it's Lofi!

5376
05:15:02,490 --> 05:15:03,130
I forgot him!

5377
05:15:03,850 --> 05:15:06,070
He was super chat everything you think.

5378
05:15:08,310 --> 05:15:09,550
It was Virtual.

5379
05:15:15,610 --> 05:15:18,970
I can't fight fate.

5380
05:15:23,090 --> 05:15:25,750
You have two wolves inside you.

5381
05:15:26,150 --> 05:15:26,590
No!

5382
05:15:27,470 --> 05:15:28,890
That was Lyra!

5383
05:15:28,890 --> 05:15:32,850
I thought it was Metasporical, Loki!

5384
05:15:34,430 --> 05:15:37,690
You were the super chat magic thing you think.

5385
05:16:11,540 --> 05:16:13,220
So sad.

5386
05:16:15,100 --> 05:16:18,680
I thought I raised him better.

5387
05:16:24,380 --> 05:16:26,340
I'm so sad.

5388
05:16:27,320 --> 05:16:30,380
I thought I did right with him.

5389
05:16:30,380 --> 05:16:32,660
I thought I raised him right.

5390
05:16:32,840 --> 05:16:34,320
But it doesn't matter.

5391
05:16:34,700 --> 05:16:37,980
The prophecy foretold he's gonna fuck animals.

5392
05:16:39,900 --> 05:16:41,740
He's not even gonna fuck!

5393
05:16:41,780 --> 05:16:44,200
I was gonna get fucked by a horse!

5394
05:16:44,960 --> 05:16:49,440
It's not even a top!

5395
05:16:57,650 --> 05:16:59,170
Loki, please.

5396
05:17:04,830 --> 05:17:07,230
That's a take away!

5397
05:17:13,410 --> 05:17:16,450
He heard of my disappointments.

5398
05:17:16,510 --> 05:17:18,090
Where am I supposed to go?

5399
05:17:18,370 --> 05:17:20,050
It's all so bright!

5400
05:17:24,790 --> 05:17:27,910
Don't spoil 2 for me!

5401
05:17:33,930 --> 05:17:35,670
I understand if you wanna go home.

5402
05:17:36,670 --> 05:17:37,230
But...

5403
05:17:37,230 --> 05:17:38,910
The snake verse makes more sense now.

5404
05:17:39,010 --> 05:17:41,630
It really was an awakening for Loki and for Shiloh.

5405
05:17:42,150 --> 05:17:45,610
That one dead cat thing you were the super chat thing you think.

5406
05:17:48,370 --> 05:17:49,490
That's a weird name.

5407
05:17:50,170 --> 05:17:53,290
He's like looking at me through the door window!

5408
05:17:54,010 --> 05:17:55,610
He's like judging me!

5409
05:17:58,110 --> 05:17:58,810
Wait, wait, wait.

5410
05:17:58,850 --> 05:17:59,390
Okay, guys.

5411
05:17:59,450 --> 05:18:01,130
I have to take a picture of this.

5412
05:18:03,350 --> 05:18:04,150
Oh my god.

5413
05:18:05,450 --> 05:18:07,850
He's like, I told you.

5414
05:18:08,730 --> 05:18:10,830
I fucking told you.

5415
05:18:11,490 --> 05:18:11,730
Okay,

5416
05:18:16,170 --> 05:18:18,550
I have to show you guys this.

5417
05:18:18,710 --> 05:18:20,830
It's actually so silly.

5418
05:18:21,270 --> 05:18:23,450
It's actually so silly.

5419
05:18:23,610 --> 05:18:24,310
I can't.

5420
05:18:25,350 --> 05:18:26,790
I fucking can't.

5421
05:18:28,830 --> 05:18:30,430
He's just like, I told you.

5422
05:18:30,670 --> 05:18:32,030
I fucking told you.

5423
05:18:34,170 --> 05:18:35,750
You raised a freak!

5424
05:18:36,410 --> 05:18:37,890
A fucking freak!

5425
05:18:38,410 --> 05:18:40,010
You raised him like this!

5426
05:18:40,550 --> 05:18:41,990
I didn't know!

5427
05:18:42,190 --> 05:18:43,710
Doki Abertosh!

5428
05:18:44,190 --> 05:18:46,190
I didn't know!

5429
05:18:48,990 --> 05:18:52,650
I didn't know you would turn out like this!

5430
05:18:58,170 --> 05:19:00,810
Okay, it's pretty silly.

5431
05:19:00,810 --> 05:19:03,130
It's a pretty silly picture.

5432
05:19:03,450 --> 05:19:04,050
Alright.

5433
05:19:05,110 --> 05:19:07,090
I zoomed it in a little bit.

5434
05:19:08,470 --> 05:19:09,730
Okay, where is it?

5435
05:19:10,150 --> 05:19:10,930
Where's the image?

5436
05:19:11,130 --> 05:19:11,890
Here we go.

5437
05:19:15,970 --> 05:19:17,510
He's like right here.

5438
05:19:19,290 --> 05:19:20,810
He's like, I told you.

5439
05:19:22,090 --> 05:19:23,310
I fucking told you.

5440
05:19:29,250 --> 05:19:31,070
It's like a window door.

5441
05:19:31,070 --> 05:19:32,150
He's like, I told you.

5442
05:19:32,290 --> 05:19:35,070
I told you he was gonna be a fucking freak.

5443
05:19:35,170 --> 05:19:36,350
I told you.

5444
05:19:44,950 --> 05:19:45,870
He knew.

5445
05:19:47,470 --> 05:19:48,430
He fucking knew.

5446
05:20:01,420 --> 05:20:02,920
Wait, where's the dwarves?

5447
05:20:03,380 --> 05:20:05,020
Did they just leave you on the ground like that?

5448
05:20:13,960 --> 05:20:18,180
In one of the giant panels in the world, it depicts Odin on an eight-legged horse.

5449
05:20:18,320 --> 05:20:19,580
It's already been born.

5450
05:20:19,960 --> 05:20:21,780
Ruby, thank you for your very first super chat!

5451
05:20:21,900 --> 05:20:22,580
Thank you, thank you!

5452
05:20:22,820 --> 05:20:24,220
It could've been a prophecy.

5453
05:20:24,600 --> 05:20:26,180
You don't know that, Ruby!

5454
05:20:26,680 --> 05:20:29,140
It could've been a prophecy, too!

5455
05:20:34,600 --> 05:20:36,060
Oh my god!

5456
05:20:36,800 --> 05:20:38,160
Oh, we did it!

5457
05:20:38,220 --> 05:20:39,740
We finished the game!

5458
05:20:41,040 --> 05:20:41,600
But...

5459
05:20:41,600 --> 05:20:43,620
But at what cost?

5460
05:20:44,880 --> 05:20:46,280
We did it!

5461
05:20:46,720 --> 05:20:48,020
That's how I am!

5462
05:20:48,160 --> 05:20:49,500
That's how it ends!

5463
05:20:49,900 --> 05:20:52,000
I find out you're a freak!

5464
05:20:52,440 --> 05:20:53,700
That's how I end

5465
05:21:00,540 --> 05:21:00,720
it!

5466
05:21:01,480 --> 05:21:03,520
Why does it end like that?

5467
05:21:05,240 --> 05:21:06,480
Alright, go back home.

5468
05:21:06,520 --> 05:21:07,100
Oh, okay.

5469
05:21:07,320 --> 05:21:08,120
Keep going.

5470
05:21:08,220 --> 05:21:09,380
Okay, I'm not home yet.

5471
05:21:09,440 --> 05:21:10,220
Oh, thank god.

5472
05:21:10,320 --> 05:21:11,400
Okay, thank god.

5473
05:21:11,460 --> 05:21:11,880
Okay.

5474
05:21:12,220 --> 05:21:14,000
Okay, that's not how it ends.

5475
05:21:14,000 --> 05:21:14,920
Okay, thank god.

5476
05:21:15,000 --> 05:21:16,060
Do I go back to Midgard?

5477
05:21:16,240 --> 05:21:17,140
Where is home?

5478
05:21:18,800 --> 05:21:19,920
Guys, where...

5479
05:21:19,920 --> 05:21:22,040
Do I go back to Midgard?

5480
05:21:23,480 --> 05:21:23,960
Okay.

5481
05:21:25,080 --> 05:21:25,960
Okay, okay.

5482
05:21:26,000 --> 05:21:26,900
That's not how it ends.

5483
05:21:27,020 --> 05:21:28,260
Thank fucking god!

5484
05:21:28,380 --> 05:21:31,500
I don't want it to end finding out you're fucking lowkey.

5485
05:21:35,400 --> 05:21:36,500
Okay, thank god.

5486
05:21:37,420 --> 05:21:38,440
Thank fucking god.

5487
05:21:48,280 --> 05:21:49,680
Ragnarok.

5488
05:21:51,100 --> 05:21:52,500
Ragnarok.

5489
05:21:56,420 --> 05:21:58,900
Don't look at him.

5490
05:22:09,960 --> 05:22:10,660
Alright.

5491
05:22:14,620 --> 05:22:16,560
Wait, why can't I fast travel?

5492
05:22:21,260 --> 05:22:23,040
Wait, why can't I fast travel?

5493
05:22:24,100 --> 05:22:25,320
What the fuck?

5494
05:22:28,520 --> 05:22:28,880
Guys!

5495
05:22:29,680 --> 05:22:32,000
I have to walk home?!

5496
05:22:33,680 --> 05:22:34,600
Oh, no.

5497
05:22:34,860 --> 05:22:35,800
No, he's just talking.

5498
05:22:51,440 --> 05:22:51,960
Alright.

5499
05:22:52,740 --> 05:22:53,200
Alright.

5500
05:22:53,420 --> 05:22:53,640
Alright, okay.

5501
05:22:53,820 --> 05:22:54,280
They finished off.

5502
05:22:54,360 --> 05:22:55,960
Okay, I thought they were gonna hold me hostage.

5503
05:22:56,600 --> 05:22:58,840
Okay, I was gonna be a little afraid there.

5504
05:22:59,840 --> 05:23:00,360
Alright.

5505
05:23:00,360 --> 05:23:00,880
Okay.

5506
05:23:01,440 --> 05:23:03,100
Where was home?

5507
05:23:04,220 --> 05:23:04,740
Alright.

5508
05:23:04,740 --> 05:23:05,260
Home.

5509
05:23:06,520 --> 05:23:07,560
At least...

5510
05:23:07,560 --> 05:23:09,860
At least it just doesn't end on that note.

5511
05:23:10,160 --> 05:23:10,940
Thank god.

5512
05:23:15,840 --> 05:23:18,340
No, we're not doing... No.

5513
05:23:18,760 --> 05:23:20,400
We're not doing that again, son.

5514
05:23:22,380 --> 05:23:22,920
I take...

5515
05:23:22,920 --> 05:23:23,280
You know what?

5516
05:23:23,300 --> 05:23:24,080
No, you're...

5517
05:23:24,080 --> 05:23:25,060
Oh my god.

5518
05:23:25,120 --> 05:23:26,320
I take back, son.

5519
05:23:35,520 --> 05:23:37,180
Oh my god.

5520
05:23:37,180 --> 05:23:38,340
So it's true.

5521
05:23:38,740 --> 05:23:41,500
He is gonna get an egg-legged horse.

5522
05:23:42,120 --> 05:23:43,900
It was a prophecy!

5523
05:23:51,600 --> 05:23:54,120
Why did you do this to my son?

5524
05:23:54,900 --> 05:23:57,260
Did I just run in a circle?

5525
05:24:05,260 --> 05:24:06,720
Oh, there you go.

5526
05:24:09,160 --> 05:24:11,500
Alright, it's time to sleep away the pain.

5527
05:24:22,500 --> 05:24:24,720
And it's time to sleep away.

5528
05:24:25,260 --> 05:24:27,920
Sleep it all away as if it never happened.

5529
05:24:28,540 --> 05:24:30,040
Where the fuck is my door?

5530
05:24:30,140 --> 05:24:30,920
Oh, there it is.

5531
05:24:30,980 --> 05:24:32,120
I walked past it.

5532
05:24:37,580 --> 05:24:39,740
Time to sleep it all away.

5533
05:24:40,800 --> 05:24:42,380
Bury everything.

5534
05:24:43,400 --> 05:24:44,560
Repress the trauma.

5535
05:24:45,680 --> 05:24:47,680
Knowing what he's gonna become.

5536
05:24:51,440 --> 05:24:53,640
I didn't raise him right.

5537
05:24:53,760 --> 05:24:55,300
I can't stop destiny.

5538
05:24:55,620 --> 05:24:57,200
That's the worst part.

5539
05:24:58,080 --> 05:25:00,380
But you can't stop destiny.

5540
05:25:18,500 --> 05:25:19,220
Door?

5541
05:25:32,110 --> 05:25:32,830
Humor.

5542
05:25:40,320 --> 05:25:47,840
It looked like he was gonna look like, you know, like he was gonna draw the like, draw the gun.

5543
05:25:49,640 --> 05:25:51,300
Oh my god.

5544
05:25:52,740 --> 05:25:54,300
Oh my god.

5545
05:25:54,580 --> 05:25:56,160
We did it, everyone!

5546
05:25:56,820 --> 05:25:58,680
We fucking did it!

5547
05:25:58,800 --> 05:26:00,900
We beat God of War!

5548
05:26:04,620 --> 05:26:05,760
Absolute cinema.

5549
05:26:06,600 --> 05:26:07,840
Right there.

5550
05:26:09,040 --> 05:26:11,020
Behold the God of Thunder.

5551
05:26:11,760 --> 05:26:13,060
I- Oh my god.

5552
05:26:13,260 --> 05:26:15,380
That was the biggest plot twist for me.

5553
05:26:15,580 --> 05:26:17,720
Finding out he was Loki all along.

5554
05:26:17,960 --> 05:26:19,640
I- Oh my god.

5555
05:26:19,800 --> 05:26:21,220
I'm so- I'm sad.

5556
05:26:25,820 --> 05:26:29,580
I just- Oh my god.

5557
05:26:29,680 --> 05:26:33,720
I don't know why finding out he was Loki all along made me so sad.

5558
05:26:33,840 --> 05:26:38,020
Cause I felt like, no matter how well I raised- We failed him.

5559
05:26:38,080 --> 05:26:39,300
We failed him as a father.

5560
05:26:39,840 --> 05:26:43,300
If anybody has the biggest daddy issues, it's Loki.

5561
05:26:43,700 --> 05:26:46,920
Loki is like the embodiment of daddy issues.

5562
05:26:47,200 --> 05:26:48,540
We fucking failed him.

5563
05:26:48,780 --> 05:26:52,680
We- He has daddy and mommy issues.

5564
05:26:53,080 --> 05:26:54,240
Like, we-

5565
05:26:58,360 --> 05:26:59,780
Oh my god.

5566
05:26:59,780 --> 05:27:02,600
Oh, I'm so sad.

5567
05:27:04,060 --> 05:27:18,780
I was like, son, as long as you're not a freak- One of those freaky gods that bang animals or do incest, you're gonna grow up to be a good god.

5568
05:27:18,980 --> 05:27:21,720
And then- Oh, I was wrong.

5569
05:27:22,560 --> 05:27:23,560
I was wrong.

5570
05:27:23,780 --> 05:27:25,540
And he's not even banging them.

5571
05:27:25,640 --> 05:27:28,000
He's getting banged by them.

5572
05:27:28,000 --> 05:27:31,220
Like, what kind of disappointment have I raised?

5573
05:27:34,260 --> 05:27:38,740
I shouldn't have taken him to the snake guys.

5574
05:27:39,770 --> 05:27:42,040
Why did I encourage it?

5575
05:27:42,160 --> 05:27:43,920
No wonder he liked it.

5576
05:27:44,000 --> 05:27:46,620
I awakened something in him.

5577
05:27:51,680 --> 05:27:56,160
I blamed a month-long abandonment for how he turned out.

5578
05:27:56,160 --> 05:27:58,940
CV, thank you for the super chat.

5579
05:27:59,040 --> 05:28:00,540
Thank you, thank you.

5580
05:28:00,860 --> 05:28:02,160
Doki, stop.

5581
05:28:03,160 --> 05:28:04,480
Is this the only- Yes.

5582
05:28:05,260 --> 05:28:06,500
This is the only thing.

5583
05:28:07,200 --> 05:28:11,600
Finding out he was low-key all along, it just- Oh, it hurt.

5584
05:28:19,380 --> 05:28:21,000
Oh my god.

5585
05:28:22,020 --> 05:28:22,580
Oh.

5586
05:28:23,120 --> 05:28:24,780
Anyway, that was a fun game.

5587
05:28:24,940 --> 05:28:30,220
I actually- The story was like- The story has actually been incredibly enjoyable throughout it.

5588
05:28:31,360 --> 05:28:38,880
So like, it's definitely been a very wild ride throughout the last four months.

5589
05:28:38,980 --> 05:28:43,980
I like- Some people were like, there's no way she's gonna finish God of War today.

5590
05:28:44,240 --> 05:28:45,720
I proved you all wrong.

5591
05:28:46,260 --> 05:28:47,180
I knew it!

5592
05:28:47,260 --> 05:28:48,880
I knew I could do it!

5593
05:28:49,440 --> 05:28:50,240
What's the next series?

5594
05:28:50,380 --> 05:28:55,240
Well, the next series is Dynasty Warriors Origins because we have a lot- I don't know how long it is.

5595
05:28:55,300 --> 05:29:00,920
I didn't do how long to complete Dynasty Warriors Origins, but that's the next series we're gonna be focusing on.

5596
05:29:01,280 --> 05:29:03,680
So, yeah, two lessons down the hill.

5597
05:29:04,120 --> 05:29:05,480
But it's been very enjoyable.

5598
05:29:05,660 --> 05:29:09,500
I don't think we died in any of the boss fights today.

5599
05:29:09,960 --> 05:29:11,060
Oh, is the music very loud?

5600
05:29:11,160 --> 05:29:11,480
Sorry.

5601
05:29:11,940 --> 05:29:12,920
Sorry, I didn't realize.

5602
05:29:13,500 --> 05:29:13,880
Whoop.

5603
05:29:14,220 --> 05:29:15,600
I didn't realize the music was very loud.

5604
05:29:15,660 --> 05:29:17,120
I hope you guys heard me a little bit.

5605
05:29:17,900 --> 05:29:18,700
Oh, okay.

5606
05:29:19,000 --> 05:29:20,060
Fuck the credits, I guess.

5607
05:29:20,220 --> 05:29:20,720
Present day.

5608
05:29:20,720 --> 05:29:21,420
Oh, wow.

5609
05:29:22,020 --> 05:29:22,440
Whoops.

5610
05:29:24,380 --> 05:29:26,120
I sort of skipped the credits.

5611
05:29:29,880 --> 05:29:30,380
Oh, what?

5612
05:29:30,660 --> 05:29:31,720
Oh, he had a prophecy!

5613
05:29:37,040 --> 05:29:37,540
Oh.

5614
05:29:37,840 --> 05:29:43,140
Oh, he- Oh, he had a vision!

5615
05:29:45,020 --> 05:29:46,700
It's okay, it said several years.

5616
05:29:46,820 --> 05:29:47,760
We still have time.

5617
05:29:49,780 --> 05:29:52,260
Oh my god, that was a wild ride.

5618
05:29:52,840 --> 05:29:56,160
What an insane four months we were all here.

5619
05:29:56,360 --> 05:29:59,600
We finally finished God of War.

5620
05:30:00,340 --> 05:30:01,740
Oh my god.

5621
05:30:01,820 --> 05:30:04,760
But yeah, we didn't lose to any of the boss fights, I feel like.

5622
05:30:04,800 --> 05:30:07,100
We lost to fucking trolls!

5623
05:30:07,700 --> 05:30:08,720
And elves!

5624
05:30:09,220 --> 05:30:09,800
Goddammit.

5625
05:30:11,160 --> 05:30:15,020
But like, for the boss fights themselves, we did really well.

5626
05:30:18,180 --> 05:30:23,880
But yeah, thank you all for coming through the journey of God of War.

5627
05:30:24,100 --> 05:30:35,320
For those who missed the announcement, on January 24th, I will be streaming the launch of Sinuality Echoes of Ada, and I will be in the game as a cosmetic item!

5628
05:30:35,580 --> 05:30:43,180
So on the stream, on January 24th, huge shoutout to Bandai, thank you to Bandai for the sponsor and putting me in their game as a cosmetic item.

5629
05:30:43,500 --> 05:30:48,540
I will be giving out codes, I will be giving out a code where you can claim to claim the item.

5630
05:30:48,640 --> 05:30:51,900
So you don't have to grind the item out or anything, you can get it right away.

5631
05:30:52,020 --> 05:30:53,540
But it will be on the 24th.

5632
05:30:53,720 --> 05:31:00,260
I will also be like multi-streaming on Bandai's official Twitch channel, and maybe the YouTube channel as well, and on my own channel.

5633
05:31:00,340 --> 05:31:06,840
So my channel will, and it's gonna be on the Steam front page, it's gonna be on the Steam game page, the stream.

5634
05:31:07,140 --> 05:31:07,580
So yeah!

5635
05:31:08,640 --> 05:31:10,180
Thank you everybody for watching!

5636
05:31:10,540 --> 05:31:12,460
I am tired now.

5637
05:31:12,460 --> 05:31:21,920
I think we have, I have a Marvel Rivals scrim tonight, so I won't be streaming it, I believe I don't know if Kony is streaming, Kony asked me if he could stream it and I was like, yeah sure.

5638
05:31:22,480 --> 05:31:26,060
Cause I know other teams have been streaming their scrims, so it's bigger to be okay.

5639
05:31:26,900 --> 05:31:30,540
But I have a scrim in like an hour, I think.

5640
05:31:30,900 --> 05:31:35,800
I don't know, I know Kony was asking if he could stream it, so I'm not sure if he's gonna stream it.

5641
05:31:36,180 --> 05:31:40,060
But yeah, anyway guys, thank you for being here for the journey.

5642
05:31:40,060 --> 05:31:43,380
Just had the biggest plot twist of my life for this game.

5643
05:31:44,340 --> 05:31:50,240
Honestly, they felt like they just slipped that in, like, they're like, ooh, your name, it says Loki.

5644
05:31:51,880 --> 05:31:56,360
They just slipped, I was like, oh my god it's over, what a beautiful moment.

5645
05:31:56,760 --> 05:32:01,940
And then he was like, your name is Loki and by the way, he's Loki by the way.

5646
05:32:02,100 --> 05:32:06,440
And it like just, oh my god, it just broke everything in me.

5647
05:32:08,540 --> 05:32:11,080
And he just dropped it out of nowhere.

5648
05:32:14,120 --> 05:32:21,720
Hey guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated, pause the game and move around and get that blood flowing.

5649
05:32:22,080 --> 05:32:26,120
And if you, except for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

5650
05:32:26,280 --> 05:32:28,500
I'll see you guys next time everybody, bye guys!

5651
05:32:28,700 --> 05:32:29,140
Bye!
