1
00:00:37,400 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm crazy about what I can touch and what I can seek I don't even know what fate is, my eyes are full of pain But one day you will realize that behind your back There are wings to aim for the distant future That's what I believe A cruel angel's reincarnation

2
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,700
Be a

3
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,590
legend, young boy Be a legend,

4
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:44,270
young boy

5
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:09,690
Be a legend Even if the blue wind knocks on the door of my heart You are just staring at me and smiling

6
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,150
少年よ 神話になれ!

7
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,200
残酷な天使のように 少年よ 神話になれ!

8
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:43,430
風が今 群れのドアを叩いても 私だけを ただ見つめて 微笑んで

9
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:22,720
I took, I meant, I took every, I, okay, not every medication possible, like, oh my god, I just know, oh my god, please, sorry, I'm gonna close my door so my humidifier can work perfectly fine.

10
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:37,300
Alright, I got my Buckley's, uh, meds in, I got my tea, my hot tea, I did Manuka honey, and then I also did the, the Chinese black herbal medicine.

11
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,060
Okay, we're okay, we're not okay, but we're okay.

12
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:58,140
But today is a very special stream because today we are sponsored by Nikkei again, Nikkei Goddess of Victory, for their very special promotion, the Evangelion promotion.

13
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,220
Their second one, by the way, this is their second collaboration with EVA, I'm so sorry if I'm pronouncing Evangelion wrong.

14
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:32,200
Um, um, is it bad to say I've never watched or, I know the references, I know every reference is there, I never, I never watched or read, I guess you can't read it because it was a, it was a show slash anime, but I have seen all the GIFs and all the references and everything,

15
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,420
does that count?

16
00:05:39,960 --> 00:06:01,380
I know, congratulate, all the memes, I know all the memes, so like, I know all the memes, I know who's the best girl, I know who's the worst girl, I know, I know all the, I, I know, um, I know the, the, the end, the end couple, um, and everything, so like,

17
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,740
I know all the ones that mattered, you know?

18
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:23,020
Um, and then I know like, that white haired dude, that's like, I want you Shinji, like, I have no other context other than the fact that this guy really wants Shinji, that's all, that's all I know.

19
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,380
I know the gay part.

20
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:51,920
Anyway, huge shout out and thank you to Nikkei for sponsoring me, it's always a great pleasure to, um, uh, yeah, he said, he said the best girl already, so, uh, huge shout out for sponsoring me again, uh, for another Nikkei stream, it's always a fun time checking out Nikkei ever so often,

21
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,240
so I'm really excited to check it out.

22
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:10,300
Uh, before we begin, um, we have several videos, uh, that they want me to look at to blindly react to, cause like I said, I went in blind, so I don't really know what's actually, what the new collab is gonna be, like, what actually is happening in the new collab other than,

23
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
like, the basic, like, structure of everything.

24
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:21,700
Um, I don't know what the, uh, the gameplay of the new collab is gonna be, because they wanted me to check out the new arcade mode and everything, so it's gonna be really fun seeing what it is and seeing the trailer and everything.

25
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,380
But, oh my god, you can see my voice deteriorating as we go along.

26
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:40,100
Um, but, if you wanna support the stream, if you wanna support the game, please feel free to check the link below in the description or pinned in the chat, uh, so yeah, it really helps support the stream, it really helps support, uh, the game as well,

27
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,200
and provides me more opportunities for sponsors.

28
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,900
Yeah, in real time, I'm, like, sounding more and more like a teenage boy.

29
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,900
I think if I talk in this, in this, like, voice, um, in game, people will actually think I'm a guy.

30
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,900
Like...

31
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,020
Mmm.

32
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,520
So yeah, let's check out the, um, let's check out the trailers for the new collaboration!

33
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,820
I hope it's not too loud.

34
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,900
I have, like, three videos to check out, so we'll see here.

35
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,280
Um, where did I put it?

36
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,420
I'm such a professional.

37
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,800
Is this right?

38
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,080
Whoa.

39
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,580
Whoa.

40
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,340
Like I said, this is actually their, um, second collaboration with them.

41
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:42,380
So, their new, um, Asuka, Rei, and, um, uh, I forgot the third girl.

42
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,320
Mari!

43
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,930
Sorry, I don't know if anyone ever remembers the third girl.

44
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,770
Oh, is it too loud?

45
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,970
Don't worry, I'll turn it down.

46
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:10,370
Um, anyway, um, this is actually the, they have actually released a skins, not skins, characters of them already in the first collab, but the second collab is, like, a different version of them.

47
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,110
Oh, that's the new arcade mode, apparently.

48
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,070
It's like, it's like, um, oh, what is it called?

49
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,010
Like those, oh my god, we all know what it's called, but I can't say it.

50
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,070
It's like HOTO.

51
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,910
It's like, bullet hell.

52
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,170
It's, oh my god, it's bullet hell.

53
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,250
And apparently, they come with free skins, too.

54
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,090
Yeah, they're, like, alternate versions of themselves.

55
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,010
Um, I don't know, apparently she's called Asuka Willy.

56
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,290
I don't know what the Willy stands for.

57
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:49,670
Um, but, um, they also come with free skins, apparently.

58
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,290
Uh, so yeah, it's like bullet hell, uh, for the new arcade.

59
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,590
Alright, so that's trailer number one.

60
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,070
Trailer number... is that trailer number two?

61
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,410
Wait, what trailer did I place?

62
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,790
Official collaboration.

63
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,770
Oh, okay, trailer number two.

64
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,220
Oh my god,

65
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,090
get in the robot.

66
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,690
There's the robots.

67
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,490
Wait, he has a tail?

68
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,110
Okay, you can tell my knowledge of Evangelion.

69
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,870
I'm like, he has a tail?

70
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,490
That looks cool, though.

71
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,690
I mean, it looks really insane.

72
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,390
Like, the amount of effort put into this.

73
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,090
Sure, a power cord.

74
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,250
That's what all classic furries say.

75
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,430
That's what they all say, a power cord.

76
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,850
Alright, well, that's where I am.

77
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,950
Alright, and then finally, the final trailer.

78
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,430
The official... this one.

79
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,690
Oh, I'm definitely gonna get demonetized, though.

80
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,030
Oh my god.

81
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,910
I already knew I was gonna get paid, get demonetized.

82
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,190
All things are equal.

83
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,990
I already played this song, like, five or six times.

84
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,490
It's alright.

85
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,910
But yeah, anyway.

86
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,750
So, starting today, I believe.

87
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,070
It started either today or, like, technically it started yesterday, because the maintenance was yesterday.

88
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:11,950
This collaboration with EVA started, and I believe it... oh my gosh.

89
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,150
It's called Second... so they have a new event called Second Quest.

90
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:27,950
And basically, throughout the weeks, you'll be able to basically get, you know, Rei, Asuka, and the other girl, Marie.

91
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,630
I'm sorry.

92
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,510
I'm sorry.

93
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:39,510
They all have names, but we all know which girl has a high... which girl is more important than the other girl.

94
00:12:42,130 --> 00:13:01,810
And so throughout the weeks, you'll be able to be able to pull... you'll be able to pull various girls of them, and they are gonna be the alternate versions of... because, like, in the first collab, they also had them, and you can also re-pull for them for this collab as well.

95
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,090
You mean Kaoru, right?

96
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:18,650
But for this one, you can pull alternate versions of them, and they also come with apparently free skins as well as specific skins for this collab, so that'll be very interesting.

97
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:31,090
But they have a new collaboration story, which is the Second Quest, and they have the, you know, Asuka... oh, they also have Sakura!

98
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,650
Sorry, I forgot the other girl, Sakura.

99
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,910
I think it's that girl, the girl on the far right.

100
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,650
That is so... okay, that is so messed up.

101
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,890
Sakura replaced Mari.

102
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,550
That's so messed up!

103
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,630
I just noticed, I just noticed, I was like, who's the third?

104
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,710
I don't know, there's Sakura though.

105
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,420
So yeah, I believe Sakura is for free at the moment, right?

106
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,760
They did Mari!

107
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,000
I was like, wait, shouldn't it be adding Mari here?

108
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,520
But then I noticed, I just noticed Sakura is right here, so...

109
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,220
Alright, it's alright.

110
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,620
You'll eventually get Mari?

111
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,660
Where's Mari?

112
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,580
But yes, apparently Sakura is actually an SR character, so she'll be a free unit.

113
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,560
Anyway, this girl is free, by the way.

114
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:47,220
But yes, there's brand new skins, limited edition dress skins, and they'll have new animations, new voice lines, there's also a new... oh my god, my voice cracked!

115
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,800
There's a new mini-game, which is a bullet hell, and the event will last February 20th to March 12th.

116
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:03,180
So, there's plenty of time, but I mean, the earlier you're... I'm sorry, I'm going through puberty right now!

117
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,320
Sorry!

118
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,120
Oh my god, oh my god, I'm actually going through puberty in real time!

119
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,820
It's actually crazy!

120
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,520
Okay, let's go in.

121
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,620
What?

122
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,840
My own... oh my god, I never forgot about you, sister.

123
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,120
Oh yes, there's a new character that we can do.

124
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,540
Hello, Rapunzel.

125
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:40,660
I'll never forget about... okay, by the way, I re-logged in today, and then like, I didn't know this, but like, they give you like, they scold you.

126
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,220
They'll be like, where are you?

127
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,700
And then like, your girls are like, super angry with you, and are like, where did you go?

128
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,600
We missed you so much!

129
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,920
In the beginning, if you don't log in after a while, they literally are like, where did you go?

130
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,090
I was scared, and I was so scared!

131
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,390
Okay, let's see, turn the music down.

132
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,010
Okay, I hope this is better.

133
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,630
Alright, so I'm back with Milk Rapunzel.

134
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,790
Oh my god, so much... her eyes are up here, guys.

135
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,730
Guys, this is... guys, she is literally wearing a cross, guys.

136
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,730
No... there's no... no sinful thoughts, guys.

137
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,150
Guys, she's literally wearing a cross.

138
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,770
There's no confessions today, everybody.

139
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,070
There's no... there's no confessions today.

140
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,910
Alright, so... let's check out what you can pull.

141
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,710
She's... she's not a sinner!

142
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,830
She's not a sinner, how dare you?

143
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,970
Look at all... she has like, one, two, three, four crosses.

144
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,730
How can you sin with all those crosses?

145
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,870
With the power of Christ, her eyes are up here.

146
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,090
Alright, anyway, I think guys, like you guys said, there's the second quest, the other story.

147
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,350
I know for the... okay, okay.

148
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,870
Let's go... okay, so... this is the new recruitment you can get, which is... Willi.

149
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,370
I'll just call her Willi.

150
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,450
Her full name is Asuka.

151
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:36,490
The pilot of... due to the curse of Eva, her physical appearance has remained perpetually at 14 years of age.

152
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,130
I'll call her my girl, Willi.

153
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,390
The E is silent?

154
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,750
What, is it Will?

155
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,110
Alright, Will.

156
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,630
Alright, Willi.

157
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,830
I didn't get her... I don't have enough, so I hope I get her first try, I really do.

158
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,030
But yeah, you can get her limited, like right now, basically.

159
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,310
And then, if you didn't have her in the first collab, you can try and get her now.

160
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,300
Um, Vil Eye.

161
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,480
Wait, her name is Vil Eye?

162
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,400
Sorry.

163
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,380
Why would you name it Willi?

164
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,900
Just makes me wanna call you Willi, Free Willi.

165
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
Free Willi.

166
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,520
Alright.

167
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,420
Alright, I think I can get her first try.

168
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,580
Alright, drumroll.

169
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,220
Boooom.

170
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,800
Alright, here we go.

171
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,760
I didn't get her.

172
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,220
I didn't get her.

173
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,110
Wait, did I got her?

174
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,670
I don't think so.

175
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,650
It was all red.

176
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,170
I only have like- I can try- I can have seven tries.

177
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,250
No, it's okay.

178
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,710
I wanna know who are these people?

179
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,350
I feel like- Oh my god, I always get you.

180
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,890
I don't want you, Neon!

181
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,390
I never want you!

182
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,390
I did!

183
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,050
I will sell you if I could.

184
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,690
Okay.

185
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,430
Okay, give me a sec.

186
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,450
Okay, I- Alright, give me a sec, guys.

187
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,690
Let me fix my volume.

188
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,830
What did I say?

189
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,210
Music volume is at 26 now.

190
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:49,770
In-game- In-game can be like 2-3.

191
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,910
Voice can be down a bit as well.

192
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,850
Alright, here we go.

193
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,670
One by one.

194
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,870
Can't be that bad.

195
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,450
This makes it more exciting, guys.

196
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,050
This makes it so much more exciting doing it one by one.

197
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,490
They're half a person.

198
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,190
Alright, recruit again.

199
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,550
This makes it so exciting, guys.

200
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,530
Wait, was that it?

201
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,330
Wait, it glowed a little.

202
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,250
What if- Okay, nevermind.

203
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,110
Okay, but what if like- Can I do recruit ten and then use up all five?

204
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,150
Wait, cause five and a thousand- Oh!

205
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,730
Oh, I can just use my gems!

206
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,630
Wait, no, I can just use my gems.

207
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,170
What the hell?

208
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,970
I can just do that.

209
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:59,070
Oh, wait, is that- What's my luck?

210
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,090
What's- What's- What happened?

211
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,950
What happened to my luck?

212
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,970
Why isn't Deon?!

213
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,450
Ever since- Ever since Cookie Run has all been downhill, it's ever since-

214
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,950
Oh my god.

215
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,970
I don't understand!

216
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,090
I used to be so lucky!

217
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,750
What happened to me?

218
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,010
What happened to me?

219
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,210
I used to be so lucky!

220
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,240
There's no way.

221
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
There's no way.

222
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,020
This is literally my last roll.

223
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,080
Please.

224
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,660
Please.

225
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,180
She's sort of like Asuka.

226
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,480
She's sort of like Asuka.

227
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,040
She's sort of like Asuka.

228
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,180
Like, if you like, squint your eyes really, really hard...

229
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,180
And like, change your colors to red...

230
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,080
She's... She's sort of like her.

231
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,020
Oh, and I get her again?

232
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,400
Oh, you treat me so well.

233
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
Oh, okay.

234
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,860
I have three pulls.

235
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,380
Guys, okay.

236
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,320
Music down a little bit.

237
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,440
SFX down by a little bit more.

238
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,340
And then voice is fine.

239
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,060
Alright, cool.

240
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,480
Alright.

241
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,890
Oh, they just gave me another 10?

242
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,050
Oh, thank you.

243
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,470
I was- I don't know what to do.

244
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,150
Oh my god, ETHAN!

245
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,230
Why do you do this to me?

246
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,550
What do you mean?

247
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,050
What is my mal- No, I already claimed everything.

248
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,330
Guys, you liars.

249
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,310
You baited me.

250
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,810
I thought I already claimed all my mail.

251
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,470
Guys, I claimed my mail before I started the stream.

252
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:26,730
What?

253
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,610
I was- Why did you bait me?

254
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,350
You liars.

255
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,310
I claimed it before the stream.

256
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,230
Wait, what's the promo codes?

257
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,730
Guys, it was in my briefing.

258
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,890
What's the promo code?

259
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,670
Type the codes.

260
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,070
I don't know how to use- Type the codes, guys.

261
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,550
Guys, how do I- Okay, okay.

262
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,270
What are the codes?

263
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,350
The promo codes.

264
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,630
What is it called?

265
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,190
What are they called?

266
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,910
Oh, they're expired.

267
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,970
Oh, that's why it wasn't in the briefing.

268
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,230
That's why.

269
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,110
Oh my god.

270
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,050
It's okay, we have two more.

271
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,950
We have two more, guys.

272
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,690
Surely, these two rows will be it.

273
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,450
Oh my god, is this real?

274
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,390
Is this a real code?

275
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,050
Okay, I'm copying this just in case.

276
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,290
Maybe.

277
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,190
Maybe we're just that lucky.

278
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,550
Okay, maybe we're not.

279
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,670
Okay, where do we put the codes?

280
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,750
Where do we put the codes?

281
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,190
Where is it?

282
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,270
It's only 100 gems?

283
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,710
What am I gonna do with 100 gems?

284
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,910
Get out of my way!

285
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,330
What am I gonna do with 100 gems, guys?

286
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,170
Oh, scroll down.

287
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,090
And there she is.

288
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,230
The innocent maid.

289
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,140
What?

290
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,820
Where?

291
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,000
CD key portal?

292
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,040
Oh, okay.

293
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,200
Tap to enter.

294
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,620
Wait, actually, I don't trust you guys, so I'm gonna- Alright, I hid it.

295
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,380
CD key.

296
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,540
Redeem now.

297
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,520
Oh my god, I got it.

298
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,660
I got the X whatever whatever number.

299
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,920
Okay, you guys are so smart.

300
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,860
What did I redeem?

301
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,900
What did I even redeem?

302
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,020
I don't even know.

303
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,540
I don't even know what I redeemed.

304
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Okay, oh, and that one too?

305
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,720
Okay, the 2N.

306
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,280
Okay, don't worry, I got you guys.

307
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,420
I got you guys.

308
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,620
I can't believe it.

309
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,240
I don't even get Asuka.

310
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,480
Oh my god.

311
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,540
It's been like ever since that fateful day.

312
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:16,460
Ever since I- Guys, remember how lucky I was and- Oh, the code has reached its maximum usage.

313
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,060
Guys, who used up all the codes?

314
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,540
Guys, you had to use it after my stream.

315
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,080
Oh, wait.

316
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,300
Oh, it's right here.

317
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Okay, lame.

318
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,740
Alright, nice.

319
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,820
100 gems, I can't- I don't know if I can actually do anything with it.

320
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,080
Alright, guys.

321
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,860
Okay.

322
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,480
Alright, here we go.

323
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,220
We have one more roll.

324
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,680
We have one more roll.

325
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,780
Could this be it?

326
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,980
Could this be the roll of the century?

327
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,520
Right here?

328
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,000
Right now?

329
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,480
Where it just naturally becomes Asuka?

330
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Okay, but like- Okay, think of it this way, guys.

331
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,620
If I do- Guys, technically, it can be Asuka.

332
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:25,760
Guys, technically, she can be Asuka.

333
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,860
Watch this, guys.

334
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,520
Watch this.

335
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,300
Where's red?

336
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,020
Okay, that looks like red.

337
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:41,260
And then if I- If I add it all the way-

338
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,220
Wait, okay.

339
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,660
Okay, technically- Technically, it's- Oh my god, we did it!

340
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,340
We did it, guys!

341
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,500
We got Asuka!

342
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,260
Oh my god!

343
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,660
Oh my god, we did it, everyone!

344
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,740
We got her!

345
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,200
It's her!

346
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,300
Guys, we got Asuka!

347
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,980
Oh my god, we got Willy!

348
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,640
We did it, everyone!

349
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,220
We got Willy!

350
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,820
I'm so happy!

351
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,980
We did it!

352
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,580
I don't have enough gems!

353
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,080
What happened to me?

354
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,620
I used to be so lucky!

355
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,200
What happened?

356
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,660
Guys, I used to be so good at this!

357
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,140
What happened?

358
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,300
What happened to me?

359
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,340
Not anymore.

360
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,440
No!

361
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,840
I can't even like- Oh my god, I just claimed it.

362
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,720
Nice.

363
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Free stuff.

364
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,360
At least I'll get- Okay, by the way, you can go to her passion casino and get free stuff.

365
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,440
And then there's- Oh yeah, that's her- That's the free- Oh wait, no.

366
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,840
Okay, and then there's- Which one was it?

367
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,640
There was another free stuff right here.

368
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,640
Oh, the secret box?

369
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,880
What's the secret box?

370
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,860
Oh, there's a free gacha?

371
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,660
Oh wait, is this a- That's for her skin, right?

372
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,080
Bad start to the- Oh, it's been a bad start for a long time.

373
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,020
Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

374
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,400
Thank you, thank you.

375
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,520
It's okay.

376
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,080
At least- At least I have free stuff.

377
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,060
Thank you for the aka soup, but thank you, thank you.

378
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,580
I have a soup, but that's the same color.

379
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,560
Asuka, please use it to restore your luck.

380
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,480
Oh my god, you don't- Oh my god, what happened?

381
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,240
What happened, everyone?

382
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,680
Why can't I claim you?

383
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,820
Okay, I claimed it, okay.

384
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,100
Alright, at least we got that.

385
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,820
And then we got another free gacha, let's go.

386
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:35,280
Like, girls, just thank you for the aka soup, but at least- At least free stuff more.

387
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:48,280
At least, if I absorbed all your bad luck, at least by me doing all the bad gacha spins, I have absorbed all your bad luck.

388
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,020
So you can get Asuka with my download link.

389
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:59,700
Download the game right now with the link in my description and the link pin.

390
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,660
I can't believe I didn't get Asuka.

391
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,960
I can't believe it.

392
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,200
Oh my god, what happened to me?

393
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,220
What happened?

394
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,640
I'm sorry, I'm just a little sad.

395
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm just- I can't believe it.

396
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,520
I used to be the luckiest- I used to be the luckiest VTuber in gacha.

397
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,480
I was so lucky.

398
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,020
What happened to me?

399
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,520
What happened?

400
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,980
GachaFuzzHellDance, oh my god, HellDance!

401
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,160
Thank you for your very first aka soup, but it's an aka, aka, aka.

402
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,820
Oh my god.

403
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,520
Oh my- Okay, you know what?

404
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:09,480
I never do this, but because you literally just donated $500, because I'm already- You know, it's a sponsored, I'm literally paid to play this game right now, but because you were so nice, I will buy 10 rolls.

405
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,600
Wait, how much is 10 rolls?

406
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,620
I might just buy one roll.

407
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,720
I don't know, I've never paid for a gacha before.

408
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,920
How much is- Okay, how much is 3,000 gems?

409
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,400
Oh my god, that's $54?

410
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,500
Jesus Christ.

411
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,350
Uh...

412
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,210
Uh...

413
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,010
Give me a sec, I need to think about this.

414
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,950
Give me a sec, I need to think about this a little bit.

415
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,790
Oh wait, there's free stuff right here.

416
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,670
By the way, I just found out.

417
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,290
The setup package, they had free gems right here, which was nice.

418
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,110
And then- Oh wait, there's a free- Oh my god, look at all these free stuff.

419
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,130
Oh my god, thank you.

420
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,710
Oh, and then there's- Oh my god, I get another roll!

421
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,130
I have another roll, guys!

422
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,210
Wait, do I get free stuff here?

423
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,110
No.

424
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,090
What about here?

425
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,070
No.

426
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,810
What about here?

427
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,450
No.

428
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,590
Oh my god.

429
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,730
Five.

430
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,550
Okay, $30.

431
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,890
I kept 10 rolls and $30.

432
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:51,970
Alright, just because you gave me- Okay, I didn't have 10 rolls with my first purchase.

433
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,270
This is a very rare Doki Bird moment right there.

434
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,170
Very rare!

435
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,050
I would- Not the gems?

436
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:01,790
Wait, what?

437
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,270
Which one do I buy?

438
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,050
Wait.

439
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,450
Okay, wait, which one do I buy?

440
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,650
Wait, bundle is- Guys, I'm not familiar with this.

441
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,270
Wait, what does that even mean?

442
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,390
What the fuck is a bundle?

443
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,350
Guys, I don't understand the context of this.

444
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,450
What do you mean by bundle?

445
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,230
You mean these?

446
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,770
First icon, second package?

447
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,430
Oh, which one?

448
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,970
This one?

449
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,890
Wait, is that it?

450
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,290
The $20 one?

451
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,070
Is that one?

452
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,450
The special recruit pack?

453
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,670
Is that it?

454
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,310
Oh my god.

455
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,590
Okay, there we go.

456
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,810
Alright, that's a good investment.

457
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,530
$20 for $500?

458
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,830
I feel like that's a good deal.

459
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,870
That's such a good deal right there.

460
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,980
Oh my god, what happened to me?

461
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,480
Is this how people get into- I don't understand.

462
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,980
I've always been so lucky.

463
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,240
Like, what happened to me?

464
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,280
Like, what happened?

465
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,040
I've never been so unlucky before.

466
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,780
What the fuck happened to me?

467
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,280
What?

468
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,340
I don't understand.

469
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,620
I've never felt this way before.

470
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,800
Things have been so good to me, but now nothing.

471
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,740
Oh my god.

472
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,000
I don't like- I don't like this.

473
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,860
I haven't had any crisis right now.

474
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,780
I'm going through some crisis.

475
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,160
I'm going through some stuff right now.

476
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,960
Okay.

477
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,960
Okay.

478
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,500
Okay.

479
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,280
It's okay.

480
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,400
It's okay.

481
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,580
It's okay, guys.

482
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,260
Okay.

483
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,660
We don't get it.

484
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,520
We just don't get it.

485
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,660
It was just never meant to be.

486
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,080
It was just- It was just never meant to be.

487
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,580
It begins.

488
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,120
Oh man, thank you.

489
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
Thank you.

490
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,480
Oh my god.

491
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,020
There's no way.

492
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,540
Is that it?

493
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,800
Is that it?

494
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:42,460
What?

495
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,040
What?

496
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,220
Oh my god.

497
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,520
Oh my god, is that it?

498
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,420
Oh my god, is my hell over?

499
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,540
Oh my god.

500
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,800
Who are you?

501
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,580
Who are you?

502
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,460
Guys.

503
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,120
Guys, oh my god.

504
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,760
Guys, oh my god, it's Asuka.

505
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,420
Oh my god, it's Asuka.

506
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,920
Look at her.

507
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,500
Oh my god.

508
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,300
Oh my god.

509
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,380
Willy.

510
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,440
Willy, you're home, Willy.

511
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,460
You're home.

512
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,380
It's okay, we have one more chance.

513
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,280
We have one more chance.

514
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,520
She's good, but she's not Asuka.

515
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,300
Oh my god.

516
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,440
Oh my god, we have one more.

517
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,680
We have one more.

518
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh my god, it's Asuka too.

519
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,480
Okay, this has to be her.

520
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,140
This has to be her, right?

521
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,640
No!

522
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,920
Oh my god, she has red too.

523
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,140
It's Asuka 3!

524
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,140
It's Asuka 3!

525
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,580
No way!

526
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,380
Are you fucking serious?

527
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,140
Oh my god.

528
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,470
It's okay, we still have enough.

529
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,850
We still have enough for another pull up.

530
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,650
We still have enough for another- oh, and we didn't get it.

531
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,470
We didn't even get it.

532
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,870
What's the point?

533
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,390
What's the point?

534
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,190
I don't want to see your freaking faces again.

535
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:02,910
You didn't get- you actually got pretty rare, very strong characters, so you still got a one.

536
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,010
Guys, thank you for the super chat.

537
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,390
Thank you.

538
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,710
We have one more pull, guys.

539
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,710
We have one more pull.

540
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,730
This is gonna be it.

541
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,270
It would be crazy if I get her right here, right now.

542
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,230
Oh my god, it'd be so goddamn crazy I didn't get her.

543
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,410
It would've been so crazy though.

544
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,770
Oh my god.

545
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,690
Okay, what else can I say?

546
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:45,170
But guys, but guys, I got- where's Asuka too?

547
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,610
Where is she?

548
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,090
Guys, but like...

549
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:56,050
She's technically Asuka if I- if I look hard enough.

550
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,850
Oh my god, you're so beautiful, Asuka.

551
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,430
Asuka Willia, you're so- you're so beautiful.

552
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,460
You're so beautiful, blue- Asuka Willia.

553
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,920
You're literally her.

554
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,720
She's literally her, guys.

555
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,600
Oh, what am I looking at?

556
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,620
Alright, view mode.

557
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,040
Oh my god.

558
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,780
Whoa, Asuka.

559
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,300
Asuka, whoa.

560
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,420
That's so beautiful.

561
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,020
You're so beautiful.

562
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,580
Oh my god.

563
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,220
Okay, what is this like?

564
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,020
How do I shoot with her?

565
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,780
Oh my god, what kind of gun is that?

566
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,460
Am I even aiming with this gun?

567
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,100
Guys, I'm talking about the gun, guys.

568
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,160
Oh, that's cute.

569
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,580
That's actually so cute.

570
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,920
How do you even aim?

571
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,100
It just aims for you.

572
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,240
If it helps, I got her.

573
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,520
How does that help?

574
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,220
You still got- I mean, I got her too, guys.

575
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,000
I also got- you know what?

576
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm gonna level her up.

577
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,340
I don't give you everything.

578
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,280
That's right.

579
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,240
I'll give you everything.

580
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,440
Everything I own, you can have it.

581
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,760
I don't care.

582
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,260
You can have it all.

583
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,620
My Asuka.

584
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,840
My lovely Asuka.

585
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,720
My lovely Asuka.

586
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,500
You can have it all.

587
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,140
I don't care.

588
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,540
Okay, cube.

589
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,340
What's the cube?

590
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,320
Do I have anything?

591
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,120
Oh, thank you.

592
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,020
You're so beautiful.

593
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,720
Alright, nice.

594
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,540
Alright, she- I love her already.

595
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,180
Guys, it's okay.

596
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,060
Guys, did you guys see that?

597
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,060
I can't believe I got Asuka.

598
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,820
Guys, I can't- when did I level her up to level 40?

599
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,440
Oh my god, just realized she's level- Cinderella's level 40.

600
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,460
Oh my god.

601
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,960
What is my lineup?

602
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,480
It's been a while since I looked at this.

603
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,020
Okay, we're putting- alright, Milk, you're getting out of here.

604
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,260
Wait.

605
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,200
Who do I want to change, actually?

606
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,500
Yeah, that was- yeah, Pastoki was going crazy.

607
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,600
Pastoki was going crazy with Cinderella.

608
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,840
Change Milk?

609
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,700
Okay, Milk.

610
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,940
Goodbye, Milk.

611
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,720
We don't need you.

612
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,920
You're not as important anymore.

613
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,780
Alright, nice.

614
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,340
Alright, now we have our level 40 Cinderella.

615
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,300
And our level 17 Modernio.

616
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:04,160
Alright, now that we pulled Asuka, Willy version, it's time to play the new Bullet Hell.

617
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,820
Oh, I need a burst one.

618
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,100
Oh, I need Milk?

619
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,140
Okay, then who do I get rid of?

620
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,980
Wait, who do I get rid of then?

621
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,000
Guys...

622
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,720
Privacy?

623
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,320
Alright, goodbye, Privacy.

624
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,600
We're getting doxxed.

625
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,040
Oh, we don't need Klee?

626
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,400
Alright, goodbye, Klee.

627
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,380
Go back to school, I guess.

628
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,820
Oh wait, it's called Privity.

629
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,720
I thought that name was Privacy.

630
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,820
I thought their name was Privacy for a sec.

631
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,240
Alright, we don't need cheerleaders.

632
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,160
There we go.

633
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,480
Is that good?

634
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,660
I should be good now.

635
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,580
Alright, nice.

636
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,280
Alright, arcade time.

637
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,680
Where is it?

638
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,580
Oh, for the king?

639
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,560
I think it's called the Red Sea?

640
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,700
Wait, what's this?

641
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,680
What's my welcome back?

642
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,240
Oh, I forgot to claim my other thing.

643
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,420
Wait, is there another one?

644
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,380
Welcome back pass?

645
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,040
I'll claim my hearts.

646
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,780
And then, is there anything else?

647
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,720
Oh, I can claim this.

648
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,140
Oh, it's in the event.

649
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:18,560
Okay.

650
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,220
Where is it?

651
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,040
It's called...

652
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,160
The event is called Red Sea Scout.

653
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,660
Red Sea Scout, where are you?

654
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,980
Red Sea Scout.

655
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,600
It's the second quest.

656
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,300
We got to play the event first.

657
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,620
I'll play the second quest first.

658
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,840
Guys, who's the swan that's getting sponsored, right?

659
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,560
BB.

660
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,460
Thank you, chat, for helping me.

661
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,660
Oh, the ocean.

662
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,600
Guys, look.

663
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,420
We're on the sea.

664
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,300
We're back on the Atmire again.

665
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,120
Am I dreaming?

666
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,180
Both of you, calm down.

667
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,220
Gatekeeper could pop up anywhere.

668
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Summit's on a D-Wave detector?

669
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:14,960
No.

670
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,680
Whoa!

671
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,040
Captain.

672
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,640
No nominees detected so far.

673
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,820
What's with Summit this time?

674
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,100
I've got a bad feeling.

675
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,940
Can't even imagine Summit stuffed an ocean this time.

676
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,480
Well, flight capabilities, whatever it is, will just sink, right?

677
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,280
Maybe a giant?

678
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,760
Support in a moment.

679
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,460
Sorry, I can't do voices right now, so they are going to sound like a 14-year-old boy.

680
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,800
We established contact with the advance team.

681
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,000
They report no anomalies around the destination.

682
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:55,880
Bang!

683
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,620
So sexy, am I right?

684
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,960
Violent tremor erupts in the distance.

685
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,640
What?

686
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,880
What was that noise?

687
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,400
What was that noise?

688
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,560
Commander, 3 o'clock.

689
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,220
Sorry.

690
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:23,720
Sorry.

691
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,980
Oh my god.

692
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,560
I looked in the distance.

693
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,820
Rappi is pointing.

694
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,980
With a humanoid weapon, a giant looms in the distance.

695
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,340
Watch out!

696
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,700
Incoming waves!

697
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,280
Everyone, grab something!

698
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,100
The sea heaves violently as another tremor rocks the ship.

699
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,960
Wait, look at that.

700
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
Are there more of them now?

701
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,320
Hearing Ana's words, I looked again towards the giant.

702
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,520
Oh no.

703
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,700
Next to the first giant, two more giants with similar appearances have emerged.

704
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,720
Two giants start to strike the first one that appeared.

705
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:07,800
Signal confirmed.

706
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,520
D-Wave detected from two new newcomers.

707
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,700
So they are gatekeepers doing...

708
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,360
Bang!

709
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,320
A deafening sound echoes through the world.

710
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,060
Support it!

711
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,620
Okay, wait.

712
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,300
I can make it sound so sexy.

713
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,060
Commander, get down!

714
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,500
Rappi shields and his helm braces against the aft.

715
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,900
Don't you know?

716
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,060
Bang!

717
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,480
A massive shot wave slams into us.

718
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,630
Rappi helm!

719
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:57,670
Are you alright?

720
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,890
I'm fine, but help!

721
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:01,550
Um...

722
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,740
Oh, it's no big deal.

723
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,220
Quit pushing yourself, you're hurt.

724
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,740
What's happening?

725
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,840
The ocean's turning red!

726
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,820
I looked towards where Ana's is pointing.

727
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,920
My day is ruined!

728
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,620
The ocean...

729
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,160
It's red?

730
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,880
It's not just the ocean.

731
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,880
The sky, too!

732
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,800
What about the giants?

733
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,500
There's only one left, but...

734
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,660
It's not moving anymore!

735
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,840
Oh my God, wait, she's wet!

736
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,640
Oh my God, look at the water effects, ew!

737
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,900
Where did the other two go?

738
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,940
The remaining giant's outline is flickering, like a shadow.

739
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,220
We need a closer inspection.

740
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,220
I'm afraid it's not possible.

741
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,220
The admirer collided with a cluster in the blast.

742
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,400
Oh my God, Asuka!

743
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,220
She's red!

744
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,700
Asuka, is that you?

745
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,060
We need to assess the damage first.

746
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,600
Are you sure you're okay?

747
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,420
I'm fine.

748
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,600
Don't push or check if you're injured and keep an eye on your surroundings.

749
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,860
I'll shift you, we can request backup.

750
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,200
Oh my God, Asuka's four at five!

751
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,100
Got it.

752
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,680
Understood.

753
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,800
There's so many Asukas!

754
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,700
There's so many!

755
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,500
These three figures are observing the chaos.

756
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,480
It's not over yet!

757
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,280
Call the Asuka!

758
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,600
Oh, nice!

759
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,520
There's blue Asuka!

760
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,190
I'm sorry, I'm going crazy right now.

761
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,380
Everywhere I look, I see her.

762
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,900
Alright.

763
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,200
Wendy, there's something contaminated.

764
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,460
Can I go here?

765
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:23,720
Wait, what's this?

766
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,040
Oh, coming soon.

767
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,740
Okay, this is a future event.

768
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,460
I gotta progress though.

769
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,800
Hold this for a second.

770
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,020
Oh, a danger zone.

771
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,700
Oh wait, we should get the story, right?

772
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,160
Oh wait, there's login stamps!

773
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,160
There might be bonuses!

774
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,200
Oh my God, yes!

775
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,300
Can I claim all?

776
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,100
Okay, we got two tickets, guys.

777
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,780
What's the danger zone, guys?

778
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,380
Guys, what's the danger zone?

779
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,520
Danger zone!

780
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,160
More gambling!

781
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,820
What's the danger zone for?

782
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,260
Sounds so safe.

783
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,640
Alright, we gotta do five stages of story one.

784
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,140
Yes, you should.

785
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,620
Chapter one.

786
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,880
Alright, enter.

787
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,360
Alright, let's go.

788
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,740
Wait, who is like...

789
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,080
Wait, who do I...

790
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,840
Who do I have?

791
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,340
Who cares about these people?

792
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,620
Who are her...

793
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,820
Who are these three, right?

794
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,260
And then we got rid of Clay and put Novel here.

795
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,280
Was it all these?

796
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,920
Yeah, we don't need these guys.

797
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,760
Plus 20%?

798
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,800
Who matters?

799
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,320
What, really?

800
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,560
We don't care about them.

801
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,880
They're not... they're SR.

802
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,140
Guys, they're SR.

803
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,380
Novel, we're throwing you away.

804
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:03,600
Wait.

805
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,520
I'll throw you away for her.

806
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,860
Oh, they'll give a bonus to rewards?

807
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:10,560
Okay.

808
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,740
I'll get rid of...

809
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,820
Wait, we need milk, right?

810
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,220
I'll get rid of you, Privatey, and then I'll put you in here.

811
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,700
And then...

812
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,140
Yeah, that should be good.

813
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,160
The number higher more pulls?

814
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:26,660
Wait.

815
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:26,760
Okay.

816
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,720
Bonus is best choice?

817
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,280
Okay, you can change milk for Neon.

818
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,160
Wait, for Neon.

819
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,300
Alright.

820
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,000
We'll put Cinderella.

821
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,080
And we'll put Cinderella and Modernia.

822
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,440
Yeah.

823
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,280
That's fine.

824
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,460
That should be fine, right?

825
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,200
That should be good.

826
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,560
My two characters can carry these guys.

827
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,820
I believe.

828
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,940
I literally have a level 40 Cinderella.

829
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,420
If she dies, they're hopeless.

830
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,300
Wait,

831
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,040
I should do auto.

832
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,100
I need to blow my nose.

833
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,120
Sorry, I'm not reading this while I blow my nose.

834
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,800
Alright.

835
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,220
Thank you.

836
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,840
That's correct.

837
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,560
Two of their signals have disappeared, leaving only one remaining.

838
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,040
That's correct.

839
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,980
It seems the green one took down the other two.

840
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,380
But...

841
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,360
Did it take down the other two just to survive?

842
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,760
A dangerous entity indeed.

843
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:27,510
At this point, it's difficult to observe or identify the remaining giant, so the central government has officially decided to name it Phantom.

844
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,950
We'll also be keeping an eye on this Phantom from now on.

845
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,130
Please continue searching for a way to counter it.

846
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,250
I have a question.

847
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,290
Aside from the Phantom and Giant, has any other D-Wave been detected?

848
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:49,930
If you're referring to humans summoned by the D-Wave like last time...

849
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:55,870
I heard that just moments ago, three human-shaped biological signals emitting D-Waves were detected.

850
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,190
Oh, you mean like...

851
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:58,870
Asuka, Willi...

852
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:01,450
Rei...

853
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,330
And Sakura?

854
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,750
Because Marie doesn't exist.

855
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:06,590
Sorry.

856
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,450
Sorry.

857
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,630
Sorry, Marie.

858
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,030
Sakura took your spot.

859
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,290
I'd like you to verify this as well.

860
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,170
So they're here again.

861
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:20,810
Yeah, this is not the first time.

862
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,090
This is not their first time.

863
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,430
She got benched.

864
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,990
I'll be counting on you!

865
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,380
Commander, have you finished communicating with the ARK?

866
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,300
Yes, I have finished speaking with the Deputy Chief.

867
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,840
It seems there are humans emitting D-Wave again.

868
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,580
Asuka, Asuka, and Asuka?

869
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,960
True, as expected.

870
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,160
First, let's secure the area.

871
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,960
Check Helm's condition and begin the search.

872
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,500
It's important!

873
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,700
There's no need to worry about me!

874
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,420
The Admirer and Agnes aren't so fragile.

875
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,460
Maintenance will be finished soon.

876
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Just trust me and start the search first.

877
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,140
Are you really okay?

878
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,720
Yes, just as we trust your judgment, I want you to trust us too.

879
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,300
Got it.

880
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,020
Rappi, prepare for the search.

881
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,740
Mast and Anchor, stay here and keep watch around the area with Helm.

882
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,820
Roger.

883
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,500
Got it.

884
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,120
Ahoy!

885
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,240
Oh my god, what the hell is that?

886
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,720
Is that a parrot?

887
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,680
Oh my god, is that parrot okay?

888
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,040
A moment later.

889
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:44,200
Commander, we're about to enter the area where the human D-Wave was detected.

890
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,980
Agnes and Neon, stay in formation.

891
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,420
Keep an eye on the front.

892
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,260
Okay.

893
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:53,820
Oh!

894
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,920
Literally little Asuka!

895
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,040
I didn't expect to see Asuka right away.

896
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,420
You...

897
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:09,620
The real one!

898
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,860
I didn't think you existed!

899
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,900
Oh my god, you're real!

900
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,920
I thought you were!

901
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,480
What's going on?

902
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,780
Why are you here?

903
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,960
The legend!

904
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,440
She's real!

905
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,500
How can you be here?

906
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:36,040
Weren't you supposed to have returned to your original world after the massive object suppression operation?

907
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,640
Did Gatekeeper summon you here again?

908
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,120
Yes.

909
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,540
Wait, look at her eyes.

910
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,420
You mean her singular eye?

911
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,120
What happened to your eyes?

912
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,400
Do you know me?

913
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
We've been through so much together.

914
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,840
Oh my god, it's the girl!

915
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,520
Of course I know that girl too!

916
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,160
She's right in front of me, isn't she?

917
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,180
Oh no way!

918
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,860
This seems a bit different.

919
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,760
What's she doing?

920
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,980
What luck!

921
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,700
Wait, you said who from where?

922
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,760
You know special duty lieutenant colonel?

923
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,820
Then you shouldn't approach that person casually.

924
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,120
What?

925
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,520
Did you have a fight?

926
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,320
Aren't you both from Nerve?

927
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,380
Why the hostility?

928
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,060
No, we belong to Willy!

929
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,360
Nerve is our enemy.

930
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,020
Wait, so Asuka and Rion are on the opposing sides now?

931
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,180
Even becoming enemies?

932
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,880
Why do I get the feeling they don't remember us?

933
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,580
Looks like we all have things to clarify.

934
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,380
Sakura, selling scores with Nerve isn't a priority now.

935
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,320
Shouldn't we focus on gathering intel from them first?

936
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,200
I agree.

937
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,940
Yeah, these are alternate universe versions of them.

938
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,940
I sound like Bobby Hill right now.

939
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,120
I can feel like Bobby Hill right now.

940
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,560
We brave Asuka and the others on the previous operation against Massive Object.

941
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,180
The Iraq was shocked they shared details about their world.

942
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:43,190
This is our first time in this world, yet you know so much about us.

943
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,470
Honestly, it's suspicious, but fine.

944
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:49,590
We'll cooperate, just don't get in our way.

945
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,950
The Special Duty Lieutenant currently mentioned resembles someone from our past.

946
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,350
Ah, pardon my manners, I'm Sakura Suzuhara, Willy's medical officer.

947
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,110
Just call me Sakura.

948
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:07,550
I think I get it now.

949
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,300
Time flows differently here compared to their world.

950
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,400
Unbelievable.

951
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,060
Our timeline barely moved, but theirs jumped years ahead.

952
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,860
A long time has passed in Asuka's world, and so much has happened.

953
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,320
Where is Marie?

954
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,660
She got benched.

955
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,620
I said it as a joke, but apparently she did.

956
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,880
Their relationship with Ray changed.

957
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,340
Plus, they forgot about us.

958
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:38,200
That makes me kinda sad.

959
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,740
At least they're willing to team up.

960
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,120
Let's get to the point.

961
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,400
To resolve all of this, we must combat a city called Gatekeeper, correct?

962
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,060
Yes.

963
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:59,840
To return home, you must awaken Gatekeeper and fight whatever manifests like last time.

964
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:07,300
The previous massive object had an anti-field blocking our attacks, but objects you touch leave D-Wave resonance.

965
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,560
Weaponizing that resonance can break the field.

966
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,780
So we should be fighting in a similar way this time as well.

967
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,240
Got it.

968
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,240
Beat Gatekeeper to go home.

969
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,460
Enough talk.

970
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,680
Let's make a plan.

971
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,220
We'll hash out details on the move.

972
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,120
Alright, let's go.

973
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,920
We're gaming.

974
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,480
Someone's like, she's 30.

975
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,600
She's 26.

976
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,720
She's 30.

977
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,320
How old?

978
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,780
It's alright, she's old.

979
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,720
Okay, I don't wanna play as you.

980
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,220
I wanna play as... not you.

981
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,120
Okay, there we go.

982
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,340
An important person.

983
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,720
A level 40.

984
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,840
Level 40, please.

985
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,460
There we go.

986
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,140
There we go.

987
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,920
As long as you're level 40, that's all that matters.

988
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,220
Cinderella's got this.

989
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,100
Wait, what did I do?

990
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,400
Oh my god.

991
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,020
Alright, easy.

992
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,320
Oh, that's fast.

993
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,070
Easy.

994
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,130
That's right.

995
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:30,310
The girl in the black plaguesuit crushes the ruptured wreckage.

996
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:31,870
Asuka carried.

997
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,890
You're right, my Asuka carried.

998
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,690
One thing confuses me.

999
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:37,490
That Rei.

1000
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,070
She's not the one we know, is she?

1001
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,290
That's right.

1002
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,050
She's from an early lot.

1003
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,410
Ayanami series.

1004
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,510
I love her pose.

1005
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,330
Her pose is very deliberate.

1006
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:56,430
A blank state, fresh off the assembly line.

1007
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,470
An initial lot, fresh off the assembly line, you say?

1008
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,010
What is this?

1009
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,070
Rapture remains.

1010
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:06,270
They're your enemies?

1011
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,390
Yes.

1012
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,730
We eliminate them.

1013
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:12,990
Tentative name.

1014
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,950
To be decided.

1015
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,730
You'll be carrying them a lot from now on, but don't worry.

1016
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,850
We'll be here with you.

1017
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:24,630
I can't agree with that.

1018
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:34,330
Even if you've had formal training and are different from ordinary Leland, you won't be able to defeat that phantom with your previous methods.

1019
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,070
Hey, Asuka!

1020
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:38,650
You keep calling us Leland.

1021
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:39,550
What's a Leland?

1022
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:42,510
It means humans.

1023
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,470
We're Nikes, not humans.

1024
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:47,830
What?

1025
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:50,550
Are you crazy?

1026
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:52,970
Accept the commander.

1027
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:57,370
We're Nikes, humanoid weapons designed for fighting ruptures.

1028
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,770
That sounds familiar.

1029
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,490
Familiar?

1030
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,170
How?

1031
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,790
This world's messed up too, huh?

1032
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:10,650
Commander!

1033
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:17,690
Without the combat experience from the past, should rupture training drills be conducted first?

1034
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,410
We should head back to the Ark for...

1035
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,010
Skip it.

1036
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:21,890
No training.

1037
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,270
That thing took my new unit too.

1038
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,250
I'll never forgive it.

1039
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:29,650
This fight's not what you think.

1040
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,390
It's Evangelion versus Evange...

1041
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,470
Gillion.

1042
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:34,370
Oh, Gillion.

1043
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:38,890
Sorry, I realized I said...

1044
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,530
Everything just clicked.

1045
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,170
I was like, oh, it's Evangelion.

1046
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,930
Everything just clicked in my head.

1047
01:04:56,050 --> 01:05:00,690
I was like, oh shit, I've been pronouncing it wrong this entire time.

1048
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:08,930
Oh no, my power's too weak.

1049
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,610
Okay, she's too weak.

1050
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,930
I might have to get rid of you and put in...

1051
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,910
Private-y.

1052
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,210
Wait, who am I getting rid of?

1053
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,890
Okay, wait.

1054
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:20,730
Is my power level okay?

1055
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,930
Oh no, my power level is still...

1056
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,710
Literally shit.

1057
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:24,450
Alright, whatever.

1058
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,810
Whatever, I'll put you back in.

1059
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:28,130
It's fine.

1060
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,570
Okay, I believe you guys.

1061
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,110
I'm mini before taking.

1062
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,490
Like, I just processed it.

1063
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,870
It was like, oh wait.

1064
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:40,230
I've been pronouncing it wrong this entire time.

1065
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,890
Alright, don't worry.

1066
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,990
I'm gonna use my other Asuka.

1067
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:46,530
Asuka tool.

1068
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:50,330
Don't worry, Asuka tool.

1069
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:51,610
I'm ready for you.

1070
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:55,250
Alright, now I got board, so I'm gonna use my other one.

1071
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,230
Okay, nice.

1072
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:59,830
I don't need to use anything yet.

1073
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,250
I'm waiting till... Alright, there we go.

1074
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:05,950
Evangelion.

1075
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:14,190
Evangelion.

1076
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,150
Connor, thank you for the super chat.

1077
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:16,990
Thank you.

1078
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:19,810
Nice.

1079
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:22,890
Alright, nice.

1080
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,090
We gotta get to five, right?

1081
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,050
If we get to five...

1082
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:29,030
Five, we unlock the other thing.

1083
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,990
We return to the shore to reach the Admire.

1084
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,590
Asuka.

1085
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:35,910
Huh?

1086
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,490
Remember anything before arriving here?

1087
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:42,070
No, I was in Alina Village.

1088
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:44,670
And then, I woke up here.

1089
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:48,030
I was aboard the Wonder.

1090
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:51,150
Then suddenly, Hero of Ray.

1091
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:53,870
And then we found that thing.

1092
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:55,690
The thing you called Phantom.

1093
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,390
That thing's no joke.

1094
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,850
If it's different from what you knew, could it be modified like a Rupture?

1095
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,030
You think it's Rupture's hybrid?

1096
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,730
You can remove the hub.

1097
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:11,650
Oh, sorry.

1098
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:12,390
Is this better?

1099
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:17,970
Do you wanna see their legs?

1100
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:22,710
I see no wonder it doesn't have an operator.

1101
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:24,730
It fused with Rupture.

1102
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:29,230
Ever since I arrived in this world... Sorry, you want me to help you guys?

1103
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:34,170
Ever since I arrived in this world, I felt that thing was dangerous.

1104
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:36,330
What happened?

1105
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:40,550
I saw it attack a Nika Nika near coast.

1106
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:46,550
So, I had to pilot my Eva to save her.

1107
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:51,560
Wait, you mean those giant things fighting the Phantoms?

1108
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,490
No, it's too much.

1109
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,290
Yeah, you saw them?

1110
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:00,070
Me and that early lot were piloting Evas.

1111
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,010
We're Evangelion.

1112
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,210
Sorry, my head.

1113
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,290
We're Evangelion pilots.

1114
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,490
So, those were you?

1115
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:10,930
Three giant robots?

1116
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,190
This is peak firepower.

1117
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:16,950
Whatever.

1118
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,390
At least the Evas got dragged here too.

1119
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,010
You rode inside them?

1120
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,630
Yeah, I fought the Phantom.

1121
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,410
Until it froze mid-battle.

1122
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,490
Maybe prepping?

1123
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,890
It's prepping for another attack.

1124
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,050
Don't know.

1125
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,350
I don't even have the specifics either.

1126
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:40,110
But judging by its current look, it might be in an unstable state right now.

1127
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,870
Thank you for the superchat.

1128
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:46,950
You mean Asuka?

1129
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,150
The third?

1130
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:55,240
Based on what Asuka said, the compact logs we have against Gatekeeper so far...

1131
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:59,330
Gatekeeper was planning to use the Phantom to attack us.

1132
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,710
But due to attacks from the...

1133
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,670
It's like I see someone wearing any form of red.

1134
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:05,610
Asuka?

1135
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:05,710
Asuka?

1136
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,570
If even the sky... Oh my god, Sky Asuka?

1137
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,090
I think this friend is far greater than the previous massive object.

1138
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:19,610
If something like that gets fully summoned...

1139
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,870
Yeah, it could cause massive damage to the Ark.

1140
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,770
We have to stop the Phantom from being fully summoned.

1141
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:29,910
Wait, was that impact just now also from Gatekeeper summoning?

1142
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,250
That's insane.

1143
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,070
Alright.

1144
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:37,270
It's time to kill again.

1145
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,390
Oh, you're all Asuka.

1146
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:42,970
Why am I always you?

1147
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,710
I don't care about you!

1148
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:45,970
Alright.

1149
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:46,490
Pew!

1150
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:47,890
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1151
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,510
Damn, look at me go.

1152
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:51,450
My level 14.

1153
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:53,350
Okay, don't worry.

1154
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,050
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1155
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:57,430
Okay.

1156
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,390
Nice.

1157
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,350
Nice, alright.

1158
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:03,530
And then...

1159
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,690
We'll just use my Cinderella attack.

1160
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:06,770
Oh my god, nice.

1161
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,850
Oh wait, everybody's dead.

1162
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,270
Wait.

1163
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:11,690
Oh, that's awkward.

1164
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:13,710
Um, guys?

1165
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:17,730
How... how are they all dead, guys?

1166
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,310
How are they all...

1167
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:22,310
Whoa, that's awkward.

1168
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,510
I'm reloading.

1169
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,390
That's a little awkward.

1170
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:31,330
I did not expect them to be all dead.

1171
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,010
Dead already?

1172
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,370
So...

1173
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:35,470
Okay.

1174
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,490
Oh, it's just me?

1175
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,750
Okay, guys.

1176
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,500
I think...

1177
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:48,130
Maybe they have a lot of power levels.

1178
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,950
Just maybe.

1179
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,370
Just... oh.

1180
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,870
Oh, I'll just wait until it's over.

1181
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,230
Oh, I think we're dead.

1182
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,630
Okay,

1183
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,630
I guess I'll level up Mirdania.

1184
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:14,270
I don't know who to level up.

1185
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,430
Wait, I don't have enough.

1186
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:20,890
Wait, can I limit break Cinderella?

1187
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,410
Can I limit break you?

1188
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:26,450
Oh, I can't.

1189
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,650
Oh.

1190
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:30,590
Wait, no.

1191
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,110
Oh, you actually write Asuka.

1192
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,870
I meant Asuka.

1193
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:36,770
Oh, no.

1194
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,210
Oh, can I even... oh.

1195
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,090
Oh, wait, I can limit break her.

1196
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,660
Okay, nice.

1197
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,120
Yay!

1198
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,620
Wait, I can upgrade her with her own body parts.

1199
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,620
Is that good?

1200
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,640
Go to base and level sync?

1201
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,300
Oh.

1202
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,220
Oh, I level sync.

1203
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,760
Where's my base?

1204
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,250
Guys, I'm a little confused.

1205
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:13,470
What?

1206
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,010
I don't have base.

1207
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:19,810
Guys, no.

1208
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,290
It's locked.

1209
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,230
I have never finished 2.12.

1210
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:26,750
I have never finished 2.12.

1211
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:28,570
No!

1212
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,130
Guys, I can't open the boxes.

1213
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,590
Guys, which box do I open?

1214
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,010
Guys.

1215
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,630
Which box can I open?

1216
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:42,010
Do I open it all?

1217
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:44,970
Okay.

1218
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,250
Do I open these?

1219
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:50,770
All of them?

1220
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:51,290
Okay.

1221
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,750
Nice.

1222
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:53,870
Alright.

1223
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:56,710
I'm opening them all.

1224
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:57,570
I don't know.

1225
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:58,450
What are these?

1226
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,830
I don't know.

1227
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,530
Open it all.

1228
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:04,790
I don't know what you are.

1229
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,430
I don't know what you are.

1230
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,150
Oh my god.

1231
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,630
What are you?

1232
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:12,930
Okay.

1233
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,430
What is this?

1234
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:16,930
What is that?

1235
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:18,150
Possible rewards?

1236
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:18,730
What do I get?

1237
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,170
Oh, I got a little boy.

1238
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,330
I got an exercise commander.

1239
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,230
Oh my god, he's sleeping.

1240
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:28,190
Look at him.

1241
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:29,870
That's me.

1242
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:32,890
Oh my god.

1243
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:35,070
That's me again.

1244
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,990
Now, I'm shopping a retail therapy for Asuka.

1245
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,250
Now, I'm cooking for Asuka.

1246
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:47,950
Okay, that's not... that box wasn't important.

1247
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,430
That box...

1248
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,630
That box wasn't important.

1249
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:52,630
Okay.

1250
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:53,650
Alright.

1251
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,670
Now.

1252
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:57,970
Okay, let's see squad.

1253
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:01,010
Let's see.

1254
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,190
Can I upgrade you now?

1255
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,910
Okay, I'll just limit break you.

1256
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,550
Just limit break you.

1257
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:11,590
That's my best point.

1258
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:13,830
Okay, I limit break her.

1259
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:15,290
I need limit break.

1260
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:16,910
I have so many Neons.

1261
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:19,830
I...

1262
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,650
Okay, nice.

1263
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:22,650
Now, you're stronger.

1264
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,470
And now, you're a little stronger.

1265
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,090
Okay, she should be fine now.

1266
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:30,830
She should be fine, right?

1267
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,390
Right.

1268
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:33,670
What was the other one?

1269
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,250
Was it honest?

1270
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,410
Yeah, it was honest.

1271
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,330
Okay.

1272
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,150
This should be fine.

1273
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,070
We have so many.

1274
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:43,310
Alright.

1275
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:46,750
I'm pretty sure that's all the limit breaks I have.

1276
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:50,630
I know I don't have another Modernia and I don't... I know I don't have another Cinderella.

1277
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,710
So, it should be fine.

1278
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,270
We should be able to... we can win this now.

1279
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:57,750
Okay, no.

1280
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:58,670
Don't do this to me.

1281
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:02,510
Don't do this to me.

1282
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:05,390
Don't do this to me.

1283
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:08,510
Alright.

1284
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,970
This time, we can do this.

1285
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:13,830
I believe.

1286
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,470
Oh, wait.

1287
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,210
Okay, guys.

1288
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:17,130
I have an idea.

1289
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:19,470
Guys, I have an idea.

1290
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,010
What if...

1291
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:28,930
Instead of using these three, I put in these guys.

1292
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,310
Like, look at that.

1293
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,430
It says... Oh, 3,062.

1294
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:46,430
Like, all I'm saying...

1295
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:48,990
All I'm saying is that...

1296
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:50,390
I could win this.

1297
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,490
Okay, we'll try.

1298
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,990
We'll see.

1299
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:52,610
Okay, guys.

1300
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,570
I think I can win this with this.

1301
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:55,430
I think...

1302
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:58,630
It's all fine.

1303
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:59,830
I have Modernia.

1304
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,590
And I have Cinderella, guys.

1305
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,710
Okay, but if I put...

1306
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:07,850
If I get rid of these guys and put on these guys...

1307
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,970
Oh, it's a lot higher.

1308
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:10,750
Nevermind.

1309
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,970
Wait, I think it's... Nevermind.

1310
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,790
It's 3,615.

1311
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:18,910
It was a lot higher.

1312
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,590
I just couldn't count, guys.

1313
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,210
Okay, now I know.

1314
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,190
Now I know.

1315
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:28,410
Okay, we're not gonna fuck around.

1316
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:29,370
We're just gonna...

1317
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,330
We're not gonna fuck around, guys.

1318
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:32,910
We're gonna do our best.

1319
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,170
We're gonna do our best.

1320
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:37,930
Okay.

1321
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,690
Okay, there we go.

1322
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:42,950
Alright.

1323
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:44,710
Nice, nice.

1324
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:46,350
Okay.

1325
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,230
Alright.

1326
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,370
It's a lot better!

1327
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,790
Guys, this is so much better, guys!

1328
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,330
This is actually so much better.

1329
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,590
We're doing it, guys.

1330
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,510
I told you.

1331
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:58,870
It's all about the limit breaks.

1332
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:03,790
It's all about the limit breaks, guys.

1333
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,110
Oh, I messed up.

1334
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,670
I messed up.

1335
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,410
Oh, no.

1336
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:08,950
Oh, no.

1337
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:11,670
It's fine.

1338
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,570
It's so fine.

1339
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,230
It's so fine.

1340
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,110
We did it!

1341
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,410
I told you.

1342
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,030
I told...

1343
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,190
Look at that.

1344
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:25,790
You guys didn't believe.

1345
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:27,690
Who would've thought?

1346
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:29,730
Welcome back, Captain.

1347
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,850
I'm fine.

1348
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,030
That's right, Commander.

1349
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,170
Who's she?

1350
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:51,890
We're here now.

1351
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,110
There's no need to worry.

1352
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,010
Just in time, Seraphine.

1353
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:00,310
Leave it to us to hold down the fort until the helm is fully recovered.

1354
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,590
Still immobilized.

1355
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:07,170
One more hit and it's scrap.

1356
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,610
Mighty tools haven't arrived yet.

1357
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,250
We'll have to make do with the materials gathered nearby.

1358
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,650
We'll do what we can.

1359
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,910
Like pulling an all-nighter hauling water.

1360
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,100
So it's not looking good.

1361
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,680
The enemy recovers while we're stalled.

1362
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,320
Easy does it.

1363
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,920
It's time like these that we need extra patience.

1364
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,220
No need to panic.

1365
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,660
It's not like the sky's falling.

1366
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,880
We've got backup now.

1367
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,520
Let's trust them.

1368
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,420
Are you done chatting?

1369
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,100
Just like we thought.

1370
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,840
Fandom's still trying to summon itself into one piece.

1371
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,200
We need to stop it as soon as possible!

1372
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,380
Things could be out of control.

1373
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,600
Are you fine with that?

1374
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,020
What kind of stupid question is that?

1375
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,440
I'll crush that thing no matter what!

1376
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:04,780
Asuka...

1377
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,320
You can't stand idle!

1378
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,240
This is Willy's duty too!

1379
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,000
Ray, will you fight with us?

1380
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,720
If it's an order, I will.

1381
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,760
But is it your own will?

1382
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:17,900
Do you want to fight?

1383
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,200
I don't know.

1384
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:21,980
Seriously?

1385
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,300
Now is not the time to have that talk.

1386
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,160
We need your power to return home!

1387
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,160
You... need me?

1388
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,100
I hate to say this, but we could really use your help.

1389
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,540
Yes, it's a team effort!

1390
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,160
Team, you said?

1391
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,780
Alright, can I actually have them on my team now?

1392
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,260
Oh, I have to do this again?

1393
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,320
Wait, did I not finish the fight?

1394
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,280
Oh my god!

1395
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,680
How do they get stronger?

1396
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,040
What the...

1397
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,640
Oh my god...

1398
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,920
Oh, a sage, okay.

1399
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,320
Oh god...

1400
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,020
Guys, I don't know now.

1401
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,050
This is...

1402
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,490
This is a lot.

1403
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:22,410
Oh, I got claim.

1404
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:24,030
I obtained 20 points.

1405
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:25,110
Alright.

1406
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,750
What are my rewards?

1407
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:28,790
Nice.

1408
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,710
And then I get an abnormal daily card.

1409
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:32,830
Nice, okay.

1410
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,110
Oh, this is so awkward.

1411
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:40,850
Wait, can I level them now?

1412
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,550
This is so awkward for my girl.

1413
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,050
Oh, no...

1414
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,110
Oh, no...

1415
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,110
You know what?

1416
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:57,350
Maybe I'll get Asuka.

1417
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,110
Maybe I'll get her.

1418
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,230
It'll be easier.

1419
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,590
Oh, no...

1420
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:10,450
Guys, I can't just play the campaign, guys.

1421
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:11,990
I can't just...

1422
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,350
Guys, we can do this.

1423
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,110
How broke are you?

1424
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:19,190
Don't judge me!

1425
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:23,630
You can't just ask me how broke I am!

1426
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:25,510
I'm sorry!

1427
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:30,930
Okay, this is fine.

1428
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,670
This is fine, this is fine.

1429
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,090
We can kill them, I believe.

1430
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:39,490
I'll just use Cinderella.

1431
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:43,770
We'll just use Cinderella.

1432
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,010
We'll just...

1433
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:49,270
We'll just do our best.

1434
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,740
It's fine.

1435
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,100
Okay.

1436
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,320
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1437
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,000
It's so fine.

1438
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,300
It's so fine.

1439
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,100
It's so fine.

1440
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,820
Oh, it's not fine.

1441
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,580
It's so fine.

1442
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,820
Oh, it's so... It's not fine anymore.

1443
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,860
It's not fine anymore, guys.

1444
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,360
It's not fine anymore.

1445
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:33,860
No!

1446
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,160
It's not fine anymore.

1447
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,540
Oh, no.

1448
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,440
Guys, maybe we can get Asuka.

1449
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,540
Guys, no, I can't.

1450
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,160
I can't.

1451
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,680
Guys, and we're doing campaign.

1452
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,100
I'm skipping the story.

1453
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,920
Oh, my God, we get Limit Breaker!

1454
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:08,880
Let's go!

1455
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,520
We'll Limit Breaker.

1456
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,960
We'll just Limit... Guys, it's possible.

1457
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,560
I'll just Limit Break.

1458
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,960
I'll just...

1459
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,300
Okay.

1460
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,360
Let me go Limit Breaker real quick.

1461
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,060
Oh, she can't be... No, she's maxed!

1462
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,640
Guys, and we play campaign.

1463
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:35,840
I'm skipping the story.

1464
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,420
Oh, my God.

1465
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:42,960
I'm back here!

1466
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,960
Oh, my God!

1467
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,280
Okay, we're changing this up.

1468
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,120
Okay.

1469
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:54,220
Okay.

1470
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:56,840
Okay.

1471
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,860
I can read it later.

1472
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,800
Guys, I just...

1473
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:02,180
Okay.

1474
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,080
It's fine.

1475
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,260
Okay, wait.

1476
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,000
I don't want to use her.

1477
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,760
Let's just use her real fast.

1478
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,440
Don't worry, we're so strong.

1479
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:13,480
There's no way.

1480
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,720
We're so strong right now.

1481
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,340
There's no way.

1482
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,340
Look at that.

1483
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,120
Everything dies.

1484
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,300
Wow, I wish this was...

1485
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,560
Guys, what do I have to complete to finish it?

1486
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:29,980
I said...

1487
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,620
Okay, guys.

1488
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,780
Oh, my God.

1489
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:35,480
Wait, I got upgrades!

1490
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,260
Wait, I got upgrades!

1491
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,220
Oh, my God!

1492
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,140
Wait, how do I do auto?

1493
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,180
There's auto?

1494
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,440
Oh, my God.

1495
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:51,520
Goodbye.

1496
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,720
Oh, it's on auto already.

1497
01:24:58,940 --> 01:24:59,400
Oh, my God.

1498
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,680
Get me out of the sniper.

1499
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:01,820
Where is she?

1500
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,440
Okay, but what if I just upgrade...

1501
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:10,900
Moderna?

1502
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,100
Like, is that stupid?

1503
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:18,260
Why would I waste my materials?

1504
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,260
I'm like...

1505
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:21,500
Wait.

1506
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,560
Oh, wait.

1507
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,500
I didn't see it.

1508
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:27,600
What if, like...

1509
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,180
What if I just, like...

1510
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,580
No, that's actually...

1511
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,980
What if, like, I just level up...

1512
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,240
Yeah.

1513
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,720
I literally just level up Moderna.

1514
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,780
I don't level up anybody else.

1515
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:40,960
We just...

1516
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,640
We just level her up.

1517
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,460
Who cares about the three other characters?

1518
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,840
They're purple.

1519
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,780
They don't matter.

1520
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

1521
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,260
Exactly.

1522
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,900
I just spend all my upgrades.

1523
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,640
I mean, Cinderella is already level 40.

1524
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,820
It's fine.

1525
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,660
Cinderella is nearly level 40.

1526
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:01,440
So, it's fine.

1527
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:02,820
Oh, wait.

1528
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:03,480
What?

1529
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,960
Oh, my God.

1530
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:06,440
Why was I aiming?

1531
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:07,640
What?

1532
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,180
I'll never have to...

1533
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:12,860
I'll never aim again.

1534
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,520
What?

1535
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,100
What?

1536
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,020
I'll never aim again.

1537
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,260
Oh, my God.

1538
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:30,200
100% accuracy right there.

1539
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,900
Oh, my God.

1540
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,880
You mean I never had to aim in the first place?

1541
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,620
Oh, my God.

1542
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,580
What have I been...

1543
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:42,620
Oh, my God.

1544
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,700
I finally unlocked the shop.

1545
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:45,760
Oh, my God.

1546
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:46,460
The tutorial.

1547
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:47,820
Oh, my God.

1548
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:51,500
Okay.

1549
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,920
Yay, Cinderella.

1550
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,960
Oh, my God.

1551
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,320
I can upgrade her.

1552
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:02,360
Oh, my God.

1553
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,100
We can upgrade her now?

1554
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,740
Oh, my God.

1555
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,280
I can.

1556
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,640
Oh, my God.

1557
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,060
I just need more cards.

1558
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:14,900
Alright.

1559
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:16,760
Alright.

1560
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,440
There we go.

1561
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,440
It's just that easy.

1562
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:24,720
Oh, my God.

1563
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:25,800
Two years of tutorial.

1564
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:26,360
Let's go.

1565
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,460
Oh,

1566
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:33,280
my God.

1567
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:39,260
What have I been wasting my time on when I could have literally done this?

1568
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,980
Oh, you think I'm done with you?

1569
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,760
Come on.

1570
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,100
Wait, I don't care about you.

1571
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,140
There we go.

1572
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,080
Wow, that was so easy.

1573
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:09,760
Yay.

1574
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,840
My aimbot going live right now.

1575
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:16,900
Okay.

1576
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,300
Do I have enough now?

1577
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,760
Okay, I should have enough.

1578
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,000
Alright.

1579
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,880
I'll figure out your story later.

1580
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,740
I'll figure out...

1581
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,020
I'll figure out your story later.

1582
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,320
Okay.

1583
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,680
There we go.

1584
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,260
Yay.

1585
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:48,260
My aimbot's working.

1586
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,280
I just...

1587
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,700
Guys, you don't understand.

1588
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:02,980
Guys, I'm only doing this for the campaign.

1589
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,880
I'll turn the auto off later, guys.

1590
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,060
It's just the campaign, guys.

1591
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,340
I swear to God.

1592
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,760
I swear to God, it's just the campaign.

1593
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,160
I just need to get out of here.

1594
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,560
I need to get out.

1595
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,040
I took too easy.

1596
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,440
Guys, I swear to God.

1597
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,680
I just want to get out of here.

1598
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:27,780
Oh, you're right.

1599
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:28,980
I should...

1600
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:33,520
Okay, while the game plays for me, give me a sec.

1601
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:43,780
Let me put something on real quick, guys, while the game plays.

1602
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:44,740
Alright.

1603
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,520
I'm back, guys.

1604
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,380
I gotta play the part.

1605
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,480
What's the synchro device?

1606
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:56,160
Thank you, thank you.

1607
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,480
Alright, aimbot on.

1608
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,680
Oh my God.

1609
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,480
As we should be.

1610
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:06,660
Alright.

1611
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:08,860
I need everything.

1612
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:12,100
Oh, I can't really use synchro yet.

1613
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,080
I need to finish this tutorial, right?

1614
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,040
Go ahead and lock in this tutorial.

1615
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,100
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1616
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,740
God, I won?

1617
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,620
Oh my God!

1618
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,980
Oh, that's crazy!

1619
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,660
That's...

1620
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,960
Oh my God!

1621
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:17,400
That's crazy!

1622
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:17,880
I won!

1623
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:26,800
Woah, okay.

1624
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,980
More balls, thank you for the super chat.

1625
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,260
Thank you, thank you.

1626
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,940
Oh, wow.

1627
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,740
I'm so good.

1628
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:41,940
Doing it.

1629
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,580
Look at that!

1630
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:44,880
Not even... look at that.

1631
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:45,780
No hands.

1632
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,220
Not even looking at... look at that.

1633
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:48,880
Eyes closed.

1634
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:50,000
Woah!

1635
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,240
Oh my God!

1636
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,400
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1637
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,560
Look at that.

1638
01:31:58,440 --> 01:31:59,940
Oh, there we go.

1639
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:06,800
Real gaming hours.

1640
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,920
Send that clip in for gamer of the year.

1641
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,000
She's so good!

1642
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,720
There we go.

1643
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:18,760
We did it.

1644
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,160
Playing with no hands is crazy.

1645
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:26,720
Okay.

1646
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,040
Oh, I can equip stuff now.

1647
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:28,860
Quick equip.

1648
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:29,700
Okay.

1649
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:31,220
Oh shit, nice.

1650
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:32,200
Now they all have armor.

1651
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,220
Thank God.

1652
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,160
Wait, does that mean I can give them armor?

1653
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:35,880
All of them armor?

1654
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:36,780
Oh, I can!

1655
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:38,140
Okay.

1656
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:41,340
I don't have gear for her.

1657
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,480
Do I have gear for these guys?

1658
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:44,860
I do.

1659
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,060
Okay, that's good.

1660
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,260
That's good.

1661
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:48,580
Okay, no.

1662
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,540
Okay, it's okay.

1663
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,920
We all know who we're focusing all our upgrades on anyway.

1664
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:54,660
Okay, nice.

1665
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:55,600
Level 36.

1666
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:56,520
There we go.

1667
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,760
It should be fine now.

1668
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,320
We should be okay.

1669
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:02,500
Alright.

1670
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:04,020
Okay.

1671
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:05,680
There we go.

1672
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,100
Alright,

1673
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:15,880
let's go.

1674
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,960
I believe in us.

1675
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,620
I mean, we're so overleveled now.

1676
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,400
There we go.

1677
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,260
Look at me go.

1678
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,420
You know what?

1679
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,580
We don't need auto.

1680
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,620
Watch this.

1681
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,040
Look at that.

1682
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:37,240
Did I win?

1683
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,200
Oh my god, I did it.

1684
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,040
I literally...

1685
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:45,120
I turned off auto for the final kill.

1686
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,760
I was like, wait, what?

1687
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,300
I...

1688
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,740
Just for the final blow.

1689
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,860
I did it.

1690
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,360
For the final blow.

1691
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:01,360
I had to kill myself.

1692
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,080
All me, by the way.

1693
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:04,780
All me.

1694
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,780
I did that.

1695
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,680
No one else helped.

1696
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:13,080
No one else was part of it.

1697
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,140
Bro stole the kill.

1698
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
How is this still locked?

1699
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,920
Did I not clear 212?

1700
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:27,310
I cleared it!

1701
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,610
Wait, where am I?

1702
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:33,030
I did!

1703
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,110
Oh, I had to go to the shop.

1704
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:41,890
Oh wait, it's zero dollars.

1705
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:42,970
Yeah, I'll buy that.

1706
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:45,850
Yes, it's zero dollars.

1707
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,270
I don't have enough money.

1708
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:54,470
That's a dog.

1709
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:56,310
Who let this dog in?

1710
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,910
Wait, I did not finish the chapter?

1711
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,010
Chapter confirmed.

1712
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:06,170
Where's the deputy's room?

1713
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:07,430
Oh, there he is.

1714
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,230
Who let this dog in?

1715
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:11,730
Give me my room.

1716
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:15,710
You are...

1717
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:17,390
Give me my room.

1718
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:18,830
Yay!

1719
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:25,710
Yay!

1720
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:28,010
It's fine.

1721
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,830
Okay, now I have...

1722
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:35,090
Okay, now they live in my house.

1723
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:36,070
Okay, I remember this.

1724
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:36,890
Guys, I don't need...

1725
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,010
We don't have to go through this.

1726
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:39,070
I'm my last sponsor.

1727
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:40,770
We already... Oh, I can claim.

1728
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:42,870
Oh my god, yes, claim.

1729
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:43,910
Give me my money.

1730
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,370
Nice.

1731
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:48,150
Oh my god, I can upgrade her more.

1732
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:51,210
Guys, wait, the stream doesn't exist anymore.

1733
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,430
Wait, we went through these before.

1734
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:02,370
I forgot the stream for...

1735
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:04,030
When I went through...

1736
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:07,210
When I went through this, it doesn't exist anymore.

1737
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:11,790
Okay.

1738
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:12,130
Okay.

1739
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:15,270
Alright.

1740
01:36:16,050 --> 01:36:16,590
Nice.

1741
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:17,670
We did it, guys.

1742
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:18,670
We did it.

1743
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:19,770
We unlocked...

1744
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:21,650
We unlocked the outpost.

1745
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,290
We did it.

1746
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,390
Now, where are you?

1747
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,750
What?

1748
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:31,170
Who are you?

1749
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:31,190
Oh.

1750
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:42,250
You let this child in here.

1751
01:36:56,910 --> 01:37:02,230
She's a CEO?

1752
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:05,490
Who let this child become CEO?

1753
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,320
I'm getting a cough job.

1754
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:22,520
Oh, I know her!

1755
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:24,600
Is that...

1756
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,000
Whoa.

1757
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,420
Whoa.

1758
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:33,970
Suddenly, your legs do strength.

1759
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,900
Oh, but I skipped.

1760
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:46,420
I didn't like where this was going.

1761
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:47,040
I...

1762
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:52,700
I didn't like where it was going.

1763
01:37:59,260 --> 01:37:59,820
But...

1764
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:02,620
No!

1765
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,000
Guys, no, no.

1766
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,100
No, no, no, no, no.

1767
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:13,100
I did not like where it was heading towards, guys.

1768
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,260
I had to skip.

1769
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,640
I was not...

1770
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,360
I was not feeling that.

1771
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:21,800
I don't skip.

1772
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,920
Wait, why can't I use it?

1773
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,480
I need complete 3-1!

1774
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,040
Okay.

1775
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,780
Guys, give me a sec.

1776
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:36,400
Apparently, I need a complete 3-1.

1777
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:38,420
Give me a sec.

1778
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,760
I need one more stage.

1779
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,500
Let me beat up this one guy real quick, guys.

1780
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,120
Let me...

1781
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:52,820
There we go.

1782
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:54,760
What?

1783
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:58,420
Temporary place.

1784
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,340
That's a wrap.

1785
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,220
Why are these guys here?

1786
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,240
I don't want them on my team.

1787
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,300
Okay, fine.

1788
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,280
My last glimmer of hope.

1789
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,140
God, just like that.

1790
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:12,540
AKB.

1791
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:22,900
Hey, if you wanna see that, you can download the game right now using my link in the chat in the description below, guys.

1792
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:29,880
If you wanna see that, you can easily download the game right now, guys.

1793
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,060
Come on, I know you guys want to.

1794
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,880
It's in the chat in my description right now.

1795
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,620
If you wanna know what goes on after Rage 8.

1796
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,120
But...

1797
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:56,680
Yeah, but you can replay that moment, guys.

1798
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,860
You can download it and make a new account and replay that exact moment.

1799
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,280
So you can go through that.

1800
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,620
Oh my god, can I finally?

1801
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,520
Oh my god.

1802
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,820
Oh my god.

1803
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,700
Oh my god, finally.

1804
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,480
I know what I'm gonna do with this.

1805
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,820
Alright, Modernia.

1806
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,040
This is for you.

1807
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,320
Level 40.

1808
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:21,440
Yay!

1809
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:24,180
Oh my god, my attraction rank with her.

1810
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:29,320
Oh my god, I can enhance my bond, but you don't matter to me.

1811
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:30,600
It's all about...

1812
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,440
Okay, there we go.

1813
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,500
We should be good now.

1814
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:35,720
I'm not wasting it on the others.

1815
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:37,420
All in.

1816
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,100
Now we have two level 40s.

1817
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:44,480
If you think I'm gonna waste it on my purpose, you have another thing coming.

1818
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,120
Okay.

1819
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:50,280
Alright, this time, we should be fine now.

1820
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,480
This is it.

1821
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,540
Oh my god, how are we still not fine?

1822
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,560
How are we?

1823
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,080
Oh my god.

1824
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:04,680
Wait, how do I use?

1825
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,820
Oh, fuck.

1826
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:06,120
Okay.

1827
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,520
I put the level 200.

1828
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,340
Wait, I have a level 200?

1829
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,340
Oh my god, you're right.

1830
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:13,580
You don't matter.

1831
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,360
You don't matter.

1832
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,080
You don't matter.

1833
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,140
There we go.

1834
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:24,360
There we go.

1835
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,640
We should win this, right?

1836
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:29,980
Wait.

1837
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:34,620
Guys, do you think we can win this now?

1838
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,980
Guys, I love you dear god.

1839
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,100
We don't need bonuses.

1840
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:45,560
We don't need bonuses, guys.

1841
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,860
We don't need it.

1842
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,580
We don't need bonuses.

1843
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,500
Alright, let's see how this goes, guys.

1844
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:56,800
Let's see how this goes.

1845
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:02,180
Oh my god, this game is so easy.

1846
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:03,540
Wow.

1847
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,080
This game is awesome.

1848
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,360
Woah, yeah!

1849
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:13,880
We won!

1850
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:16,460
Yay, we won!

1851
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,520
Let's go!

1852
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,000
We won!

1853
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:23,960
Alright.

1854
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:25,020
Nice.

1855
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,760
It's so easy.

1856
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,120
We did it, guys.

1857
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:31,820
Oh my god.

1858
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,140
So much skill.

1859
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:34,680
Oh wait, there he is!

1860
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,320
Alright, I wanna look at...

1861
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,640
Oh my god, look at him go.

1862
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:44,720
Look at them go.

1863
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:45,120
You know what?

1864
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,400
I wanna know what this is like.

1865
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:48,680
With...

1866
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,480
What is it like?

1867
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:51,940
Oh, he's just one hit.

1868
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,040
Look at my no hands.

1869
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:56,260
Nice.

1870
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:58,900
You don't need all three.

1871
01:42:59,020 --> 01:42:59,680
I don't.

1872
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,960
It's all about sending a message.

1873
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,080
It's literally...

1874
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,560
It's about the message!

1875
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,980
You think I care?

1876
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,640
This is about the message!

1877
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,360
It's been on my mind for a while now.

1878
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:15,800
What's that?

1879
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,240
Is it for Evangelion?

1880
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,680
This is an L Barrier Density Detector.

1881
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,000
This red area is extremely dangerous for you all.

1882
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,240
What happens if we go in there?

1883
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,380
We get launched into the stratosphere or something?

1884
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,340
Are you an idiot?

1885
01:43:33,660 --> 01:43:34,440
You'll die!

1886
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,840
Humans can't operate in the red area without protective gear.

1887
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,460
But we're Nikes, so we should be fine, right?

1888
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:44,440
Yeah, they're not humans.

1889
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,140
Machines don't work there either.

1890
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:48,000
So Nikes are no exception.

1891
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:49,700
Seriously?

1892
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,160
Commander, please be careful.

1893
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,660
Would you like to hold my hand?

1894
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:56,700
We never know when...

1895
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:59,580
When danger might strike.

1896
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:00,840
Oh, thank you, Asuka.

1897
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,520
I'm good.

1898
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:05,520
I'm good.

1899
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,880
I only hold one person's hand and she's right here.

1900
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,240
Let's stay alert.

1901
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,460
Should you be alert too?

1902
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,580
You're human too, after all.

1903
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:19,220
I'm saving myself for someone special.

1904
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:21,700
Subscribe!

1905
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,020
Um...

1906
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,920
Asuka raises her hand and touches her eyepatch.

1907
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,000
Begone, wench!

1908
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,100
I'm saving myself for her!

1909
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,180
That's a long story.

1910
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,160
Let's go.

1911
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,380
We have more important things to do.

1912
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,240
Sigh.

1913
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,560
Does it see this color?

1914
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,740
I think I'm gonna lose my sense of direction.

1915
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:56,520
And it looks like...

1916
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,780
Ruptures are everywhere.

1917
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,800
Zero, thank you for the superchat.

1918
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:01,880
Thank you, thank you.

1919
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:03,780
Crappiest always, NTR.

1920
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:07,380
We're gonna get lost at this rate.

1921
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,920
Oh, I found it!

1922
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,260
Huh?

1923
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,620
It's only for Asuka and Cinderella.

1924
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:18,120
Over there!

1925
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,040
I see a huge ship!

1926
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,660
Guys, I think the year of snake is not a good gacha year for me.

1927
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:26,800
I look at the direction near points.

1928
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,560
Is that...

1929
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:30,020
That wonder?

1930
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,400
Why is it here?

1931
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:32,860
Wow!

1932
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:34,600
It's a massive ship!

1933
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,360
That's a triple A wonder!

1934
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,400
It's Willy's Battleship!

1935
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:40,860
Battleship.

1936
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:44,040
It must have been summoned to this world, like us.

1937
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,700
I wonder if the rest of the crew is there too.

1938
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:53,840
Rui tilts her head slightly and looks at the wonder.

1939
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,580
It's not damaged.

1940
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,280
Oh, you mean the part you blew up?

1941
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,560
It's been repaired!

1942
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:03,500
I see.

1943
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:06,700
Can we use it as a power source?

1944
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:08,980
My first...

1945
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,400
My firepower ally found this, so it can't be bad.

1946
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,540
Sakura, do you think it can help us take down the phantom?

1947
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:16,240
I'm not sure.

1948
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:18,340
Can you get close and check it out?

1949
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:19,360
Sure!

1950
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,520
Commander, look!

1951
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,460
There's an Evangelion right there!

1952
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,400
That's Mark 09.

1953
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,720
It's heavily damaged.

1954
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,320
Why isn't Evangelion there?

1955
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,640
And it's a total wreck!

1956
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:44,700
But I think it can still move somehow.

1957
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,280
Commander!

1958
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,620
Signs of rapture activity detected nearby.

1959
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,520
Let's head inside the ship for now.

1960
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,840
Am I bullet helling now?

1961
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,960
Am I Hoto-ing?

1962
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:58,580
No wonder it was flying non-stop after it was activated.

1963
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:04,240
But since the rest of the crew wasn't summoned to this world, it looks like it crashed here.

1964
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,400
A supersized flying battleship?

1965
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:10,260
It must have incredible firepower.

1966
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:12,400
That's strange.

1967
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,100
The internal structure is completely different than before.

1968
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,340
It might have been affected when it was summoned to this world.

1969
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,900
This structure... it looks similar to our battleship control system.

1970
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:26,980
Commander, we have a problem.

1971
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:30,000
A massive number of raptures are gathering outside.

1972
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:34,000
We'll stop the investigation for now and focus on the raptures.

1973
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:37,740
I have a suggestion.

1974
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,260
How about we use the wonder?

1975
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:44,340
With this size, it must have got... okay, never mind.

1976
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,720
It must have awesome firepower.

1977
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:51,360
VV, I just got the game and got Asuka first pull.

1978
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,600
Thanks for the luck, Doki.

1979
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,160
Sorry if I stole yours.

1980
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,780
Thank you for the super chat, VV.

1981
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:05,060
I am here to take away all your bad luck, guys.

1982
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:12,500
I am here to take away all your bad luck so you can get Asuka.

1983
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,440
It might be difficult to control the ship by ourselves.

1984
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,680
Rappi's right.

1985
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,440
We need a lot of people to operate the wonder and fight.

1986
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:26,600
We still can't recover a new unit too, but maybe we can do something with Mark09.

1987
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:30,520
Is that an order?

1988
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,440
No, it's not an order, but I'd like you to help us.

1989
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:41,640
Guys, you can click the link in the description and pin in the chat to try your luck pulling her.

1990
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:47,980
Okay, if you're done talking, come over here.

1991
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,380
What is it?

1992
01:48:52,840 --> 01:49:00,840
Mark09's upper body is intact, so we might be able to use the weapons, but her legs are too damaged so it can barely walk, let alone fight.

1993
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,120
Maybe a fine way to move Mark09.

1994
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:11,360
I've been wondering, doesn't the wonder's structure look similar to the admirer we talked about earlier?

1995
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:13,020
You're right.

1996
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,200
It does look similar.

1997
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,880
The admirer's control system is designed to be operated by a small crew.

1998
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:22,240
So you're saying we can operate the wonder by ourselves?

1999
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:25,300
Then it's settled.

2000
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,160
Let's attach Mark09 to the bottom.

2001
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:30,400
Mark09 will handle the attack and the wonder will take care of the movement.

2002
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:34,080
Wow, that's a brilliant plan!

2003
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,360
You're the best master!

2004
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:37,440
Are you sure that will work?

2005
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:44,460
It's a pretty reckless plan, but still, we don't have any other options so we might as well try.

2006
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,880
Lads, thank you for the Akasupa!

2007
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,380
Thank you, thank you!

2008
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:55,640
I don't play Nikkei, but I just did a poll on another gacha earlier and I got the new character in just 20 polls, so thank you, Toki!

2009
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,680
Thank you for the Akasupa!

2010
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:06,260
Thank you, thank you!

2011
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,980
Are you really gonna fly it?

2012
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,960
We're about to face unknown firepower!

2013
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:20,680
Let's get ready to protect Asuka Sakura from incoming rapture!

2014
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,680
You're all stealing my luck!

2015
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,520
Alright, this should be good enough!

2016
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:27,820
Early lot!

2017
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:28,980
What's wrong?

2018
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:30,400
We're deploying!

2019
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:33,680
Alright, it's bullet hell time!

2020
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,660
Oh my god, wait, that's cool!

2021
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,540
Wait, that's so cool!

2022
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,500
Alright, how do we play this?

2023
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:42,860
Okay...

2024
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:45,320
Speed up...

2025
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:47,300
Slow down...

2026
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:54,090
Safe...

2027
01:50:55,230 --> 01:50:55,830
Danger?

2028
01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:58,110
Oh, we might get hit, okay.

2029
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:00,430
Fuckin' safe danger!

2030
01:51:03,110 --> 01:51:03,410
Oh...

2031
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:06,090
Use the healing damage to the enemy.

2032
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:09,430
Will recharge energy once fully charged.

2033
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:11,290
The AT can be used to affect the AT.

2034
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:15,150
Fields vary depending on... Okay, guys, I need to get my other keyboard.

2035
01:51:21,170 --> 01:51:23,450
I don't have arrow keys!

2036
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:25,970
Guys...

2037
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:26,570
Give me a sec.

2038
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:29,230
I just realized I don't have arrow keys.

2039
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:32,750
Give me a sec, let me grab my other keyboard.

2040
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:35,090
Oh my god, where is it?

2041
01:51:57,610 --> 01:51:59,070
Grab my other keyboard!

2042
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:01,950
I have so many keyboards!

2043
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:04,030
Oh!

2044
01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:05,490
Wait, mouse works too?

2045
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:06,810
Oh my god!

2046
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:07,110
Okay!

2047
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:08,830
Okay, I'll just use my mouse.

2048
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:09,590
Okay, thank god.

2049
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:10,990
Because I was like, I don't have arrow keys.

2050
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:11,870
What the fuck do I do?

2051
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:14,230
Liars?

2052
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:14,590
Okay.

2053
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:16,030
Oh wait, okay.

2054
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:18,270
Okay.

2055
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:21,370
Okay, yeah, this is easy.

2056
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:22,910
Okay.

2057
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:24,690
We're bullet helling.

2058
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:27,070
Okay, there you go.

2059
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,010
This is not too bad.

2060
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:31,550
It's not too bad, we're doing it.

2061
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:33,850
We're...

2062
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:35,870
We're doing it right now.

2063
01:52:38,990 --> 01:52:40,110
We're doing it.

2064
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:41,110
Oh, this is easy.

2065
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:46,550
No, mouse works is a lot easier, actually.

2066
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:49,470
Actually, yeah, I'd rather use the mouse.

2067
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:51,050
I'm gonna make a...

2068
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:52,510
Wait, this is so easy.

2069
01:52:53,630 --> 01:52:54,690
Oh my god, I'm gaming.

2070
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:57,010
I'm actually gaming.

2071
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:03,570
Nice, we got... Oh, now we have a lot of bullets.

2072
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:05,850
Nice.

2073
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:08,450
I don't need to use...

2074
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,230
I don't want to use my barrier.

2075
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:09,750
Whoa!

2076
01:53:10,230 --> 01:53:11,630
I'm not using my barrier yet, though.

2077
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:12,850
Nice.

2078
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:13,770
Wait, I did it.

2079
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:14,770
Is that it?

2080
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:16,950
Oh, that was it.

2081
01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:20,690
Oh, nice.

2082
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:23,990
Air, air.

2083
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:27,170
Air aligns rings throughout the ship.

2084
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:30,270
Octus ruptures, what do they do to the wonder?

2085
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:34,390
At this rate, the battleship will lose power and crash.

2086
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:37,850
Arm damage detected.

2087
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:40,890
Looks like this is as far as the early lock goes.

2088
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:45,110
The engine, destroyed by the raptors, finally stops roaring.

2089
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:47,610
Black smoke fills the tilting ship.

2090
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:50,270
Sir, get the life jackets!

2091
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:51,730
We're jumping out with parachutes!

2092
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:53,690
Get on!

2093
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,400
The passage is clear!

2094
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:01,880
Asuka, Sakura, go first!

2095
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:04,460
Let's go, Sakura.

2096
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:06,660
Commander, you go first!

2097
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:07,940
Okay.

2098
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,860
Look, I'm human, I should go first.

2099
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,640
The entry plug rejects from the neck of the fallen Mark 09.

2100
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,180
She got out!

2101
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:20,340
As Neon, let's go!

2102
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,880
Reppy shouts and grabs my waist.

2103
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:23,520
Whoa!

2104
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:24,500
Runs outside.

2105
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:25,840
Whoa.

2106
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:29,520
We land safely in shallow water.

2107
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:30,620
Splash.

2108
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,280
I don't think, like, safely would work with shallow water.

2109
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,880
I don't think it'd be swimming again.

2110
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:39,160
Commander, are you okay?

2111
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,560
I was holding him tight, so he's fine.

2112
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,000
I swallowed some seawater.

2113
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:46,340
I'll be okay, right?

2114
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:48,400
You're not even human.

2115
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,500
Yes, of course you'll be okay.

2116
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
Captain, everyone, are you all right?

2117
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,280
Is anyone hurt?

2118
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:58,200
Master Pepper!

2119
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:00,700
I knew it was the captain.

2120
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:06,960
Meanwhile, the wonder, shaking in the air, crashes into the sea, creating a massive red wave.

2121
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,540
Everyone, get on the lifeboat!

2122
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:12,060
Raptors are right on our heels!

2123
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,860
Everyone's still... Okay, we don't care about them yet.

2124
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:15,480
Oh, wait, they're here.

2125
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:16,840
We always cared about you.

2126
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,300
Appeared from the side.

2127
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:19,800
Me?

2128
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,260
We're safe.

2129
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:24,020
That's a relief.

2130
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:25,400
Hurry up and get on.

2131
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,260
But the wonder...

2132
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:29,080
Don't worry.

2133
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,340
It won't sink easily.

2134
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,800
Let's hop on the boat for now.

2135
01:55:33,460 --> 01:55:34,540
I've always cared, guys.

2136
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:35,560
I've always cared.

2137
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:36,640
I see.

2138
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,140
By the way, you fought while piling that massive...

2139
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,660
Whoa, money.

2140
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:47,260
That's incredible.

2141
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,440
Someone get her a towel!

2142
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:53,860
She has been wet this entire story.

2143
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:56,220
Okay, come help us next time.

2144
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,920
Oh my God, someone please get her a towel before she gets a cold.

2145
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,220
Is there something wrong?

2146
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:04,800
Thanks.

2147
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,380
What are you talking about?

2148
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:09,980
You're the one who did all the heavy lifting.

2149
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,960
Yeah, but we helped each other.

2150
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:19,380
She's the anchor.

2151
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,540
What does that mean?

2152
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,360
Do they just throw her off the ship when they need an anchor?

2153
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,540
It's been ages since I've been here.

2154
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:34,080
It seems like something really huge just happened.

2155
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:39,680
Watching the world of those cute Nikkis get destroyed like this, I can't just stand by and do nothing.

2156
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:40,940
Wait, what?

2157
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:41,740
Really?

2158
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:43,760
What?

2159
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:51,040
Wait, did they actually just throw her off the fucking boat if they need an anchor?

2160
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,340
That's crazy.

2161
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:56,400
That's actually crazy.

2162
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:00,820
Wait, can I actually play the minigame now?

2163
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:13,360
Can we get back to the part where we got stepped on?

2164
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:14,240
No.

2165
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:20,680
If you want to see it out of context, you can easily

2166
01:57:23,780 --> 01:57:29,060
download the game yourself and get to that area.

2167
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:33,440
Okay, I want to upgrade extra weapon, armor part.

2168
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,140
Wait, can I even upgrade anything?

2169
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,400
I don't even think I can.

2170
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:38,780
I'm broke as hell.

2171
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:39,540
Oh wait, I can.

2172
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:40,600
Nice.

2173
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:42,760
Alright.

2174
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,060
What is this?

2175
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:47,380
Okay, let's actually start the real minigame then.

2176
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:52,480
Alright, let's do another level and then we will call it here.

2177
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,060
This is so easy though.

2178
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:58,000
I didn't even have to use my armor thing.

2179
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:03,360
I think I'm just a naturally god gamer.

2180
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,240
What can I say?

2181
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:10,300
I'm just that good.

2182
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,380
Look at that.

2183
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:13,340
I just shoot everywhere now.

2184
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:16,280
Nice.

2185
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:19,500
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

2186
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,720
Oh wait, what happened to my thing?

2187
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:22,060
Okay.

2188
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,700
I shouldn't move too fast.

2189
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:26,620
Okay, nice.

2190
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:28,320
Got more bullets.

2191
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,640
Some little bit more bullets.

2192
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:35,460
Right here.

2193
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:37,260
Nice.

2194
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:39,800
Then we gotta get rid of him.

2195
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:43,260
Oh my god, he is so strong.

2196
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:44,580
How do I...

2197
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:46,100
Oh no, that's not what I wanted!

2198
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,080
Press space!

2199
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:49,660
God damn it.

2200
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:52,060
I didn't want to press space there.

2201
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:55,840
Alright.

2202
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:56,820
Yay!

2203
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:02,960
I did it.

2204
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:07,520
Oh nice, I have a new weapon too.

2205
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:10,440
Alright, I think that...

2206
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,660
I think I looked through everything.

2207
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,200
Yeah!

2208
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,400
Oh my god.

2209
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,880
That was fun though.

2210
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,640
That was really fun.

2211
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,500
I can't believe I spent money on my first gacha game.

2212
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,340
On EK.

2213
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:26,260
I can't believe it.

2214
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:31,280
I can't believe I spent money on my first gacha game.

2215
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:38,700
The very first time I've ever spent money.

2216
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:41,580
That's actually crazy for me.

2217
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:44,120
I can't even get you.

2218
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:46,120
I don't even have money.

2219
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:48,260
I need 200.

2220
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,360
Oh my god.

2221
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:54,040
Do I have anything that I can claim that will give me 270?

2222
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,340
Guys, is there anything else I can claim?

2223
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:01,300
Do I have any more free stuff?

2224
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:02,500
I must have.

2225
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:03,180
Wait.

2226
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:05,020
Wait, I have one more pull.

2227
02:00:05,620 --> 02:00:06,240
Wait, guys.

2228
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:07,960
Guys, I have one more pull.

2229
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:11,540
Guys, I have one more pull.

2230
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,340
Oh my god.

2231
02:00:19,860 --> 02:00:21,160
This could be it.

2232
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,360
This was not it.

2233
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:26,200
This was not it.

2234
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,560
It's alright.

2235
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:42,080
It was so...

2236
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:46,990
It was fun.

2237
02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:49,390
Thank you again, Nikkei, for...

2238
02:00:51,050 --> 02:00:55,890
Thank you, Nikkei, for sponsoring me.

2239
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:57,670
I had a great time though.

2240
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:00,750
Honestly, like, it was honestly a great time today.

2241
02:01:01,230 --> 02:01:08,230
You know, this was supposed to be an hour stream, but like, obviously, I had such a great time that it didn't turn into an hour.

2242
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:14,510
Yeah, we've been playing for a while now.

2243
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:17,150
Oh my god, we were playing for two hours.

2244
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:17,690
It's okay.

2245
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:19,610
It's like she's here.

2246
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:22,990
It's like she's here with me right now.

2247
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:25,170
It's like, oh my god.

2248
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,710
Oh my god, Willi.

2249
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:29,810
It's like you're here right now, Willi.

2250
02:01:30,330 --> 02:01:31,330
Look at that.

2251
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:34,390
It's like I'm playing you right now.

2252
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:36,670
Right now.

2253
02:01:36,670 --> 02:01:38,510
Oh, she's so cute.

2254
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:39,510
Look at her.

2255
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:41,810
Looks like she's about to murder you.

2256
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:45,350
It's like I'm playing her right now.

2257
02:01:45,570 --> 02:01:47,430
Good on me, Gabe.

2258
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:48,810
Look at that.

2259
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:54,620
Worst met you while standing.

2260
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,020
Wait, what?

2261
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:57,720
Oh.

2262
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:01,400
It's like, oh, they're like Japanese voice acting.

2263
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,140
Oh, I guess.

2264
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:05,700
Well, I can't even get her anyway, so it doesn't even matter.

2265
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,200
She's like normal gun.

2266
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:12,820
What about...

2267
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:13,240
Okay.

2268
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,700
Asuka, Marie, but like nobody.

2269
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:19,420
It's so funny.

2270
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:23,640
It's so funny that um...

2271
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:27,660
that like we went straight to like Sakura.

2272
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:30,980
But yeah, it was fun though.

2273
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:32,100
I had a great time.

2274
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:35,260
I can't believe I got Asuka like four times, guys.

2275
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:35,620
See?

2276
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:39,940
Asuka one, Asuka two, Asuka three.

2277
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:43,380
Where's my fourth Asuka?

2278
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:45,260
I know I got a fourth one.

2279
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,580
Asuka four, Asuka five.

2280
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:50,320
Wow, so many.

2281
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:51,990
So many Asukas.

2282
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:54,120
Alright, oh my god.

2283
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:57,200
What do I do to deserve all of you?

2284
02:02:58,060 --> 02:02:59,500
Oh my god.

2285
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,600
Oh my god.

2286
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,540
You were all here.

2287
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:08,420
Oh, so many of you were here.

2288
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:09,940
Wait, how do I...

2289
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:12,400
How do I change my...

2290
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,280
How do I change her?

2291
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:16,440
I have a new girl.

2292
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:17,640
How do I change her?

2293
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,240
I don't want her.

2294
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,820
That sounds so sad.

2295
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:25,620
Guys, how do I change her?

2296
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:27,280
Top right.

2297
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:31,260
Liar.

2298
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,220
Top right.

2299
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:36,120
Lobby.

2300
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:38,520
Oh, okay.

2301
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:41,360
Okay, get out.

2302
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:43,120
Sorry, wait.

2303
02:03:43,620 --> 02:03:45,780
How do I get you out of here?

2304
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:46,700
Okay, there you go.

2305
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:50,060
Nope.

2306
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:54,000
Cinderella, Moderna, Cinderella.

2307
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:56,340
Where's my Asuka army?

2308
02:03:57,260 --> 02:04:00,880
Asuka, Asuka, Asuka.

2309
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:01,600
Hahaha.

2310
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:06,080
My family of Asuka.

2311
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:08,640
Whoa, okay.

2312
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:14,660
Oh my god, okay.

2313
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:16,700
And then Asuka number two.

2314
02:04:17,860 --> 02:04:18,840
Oh, Boo Crow?

2315
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:20,280
You're right, you're right.

2316
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:23,620
Let me replace Crow with Asuka number...

2317
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:24,360
Where's my other Asuka?

2318
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:26,420
Don't worry, I have plenty of Asuka.

2319
02:04:26,620 --> 02:04:27,280
There you go.

2320
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:30,140
There's my other Asuka right there.

2321
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:35,280
And then Asuka number three.

2322
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,040
And then Asuka number four.

2323
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,200
Don't worry, sorry guys, sorry.

2324
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,940
I forgot one important thing.

2325
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:45,920
Asuka number four.

2326
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:47,620
Hahaha.

2327
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:47,920
Hahaha.

2328
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:50,120
Hahaha.

2329
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:53,840
Asuka number five.

2330
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,020
Hahaha.

2331
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:57,840
Oh my god.

2332
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,820
Asuka, I'm so happy.

2333
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:06,000
Oh my god, look at all my Asukas.

2334
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:08,520
Oh my god.

2335
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:12,060
You're all so beautiful, Asuka.

2336
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,340
You're all so beautiful.

2337
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:19,500
Oh my god.

2338
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:20,620
Hahaha.

2339
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,960
I'm so blessed.

2340
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:25,500
Anyway guys, oh shit, whoops.

2341
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:27,740
Thank you all for coming, everybody.
