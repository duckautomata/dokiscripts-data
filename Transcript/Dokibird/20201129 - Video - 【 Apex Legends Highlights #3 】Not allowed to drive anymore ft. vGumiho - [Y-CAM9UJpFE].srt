1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,700
I need a call.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,880
I need to join Gumi's discord.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,200
Creepy.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,020
Alright, I'm in.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,680
I need to wait for Gumi to get here.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Should I... Hello?

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,620
Hello?

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,820
Hello, Gumi?

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,180
What's up, stupid?

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,160
What's up, bitch?

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,260
Can you join my club?

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,520
I'm gonna create a club right now.

13
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:24,720
I made my own.

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:24,880
Oh.

15
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,580
Okay.

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,460
I made my own already.

17
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,980
What the fuck, Gumi?

18
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,740
Can I join your club?

19
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,040
Yeah.

20
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,040
What's your club called?

21
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,840
Guess.

22
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,840
Pick a guess.

23
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,860
Um... Spin my mouth?

24
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm not gonna do that.

25
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,880
What the fuck?

26
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,500
Right?

27
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,380
What the... This is like...

28
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,920
Like Hunger Games, you know?

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,780
This trick.

30
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean it's...

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,780
What the fuck is that?

32
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,060
What is that old key?

33
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,660
Ew.

34
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,160
Ew.

35
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,720
Gross.

36
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,500
How do you loot this?

37
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,280
Wait, where's the loot?

38
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,380
Oh shit, there's so much loot in the middle.

39
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,900
Oh shit!

40
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,660
My loot now.

41
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,320
This map is so pretty.

42
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,020
Wait, is he fighting someone?

43
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,660
Fuck if I know.

44
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,500
I don't know what's going on.

45
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,800
Where are you, Gumi?

46
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,280
Where am I?

47
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm heading towards the circle.

48
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,480
What the fuck are these people?

49
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,520
Are those my teammates?

50
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,220
Are those my teammates?

51
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm not gonna let you go.

52
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,420
So there's no enemies in this mode, is that what you're telling me?

53
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Like who is this?

54
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:33,800
Hey.

55
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,660
Oh, I have teammates!

56
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,120
Wait, let me see.

57
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,800
Yeah!

58
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,140
I have teammates!

59
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,360
Like you'll see like teammate shadows and stuff.

60
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,500
Like you see the...

61
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,140
Yeah, see look.

62
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,040
This guy.

63
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,260
Hey.

64
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,820
He thinks he can shoot me.

65
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,520
His name is Chingu.

66
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,380
Aww.

67
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
That means run.

68
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,580
Oh!

69
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,980
It's preview.

70
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,780
Preview mode is to explore the map.

71
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,880
There's no fighting.

72
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,620
Buttholes, buttholes.

73
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,360
Get in the butthole.

74
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,720
I am.

75
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,380
What the fuck.

76
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
This is a long ass butthole.

77
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,600
Oh no, Chingu.

78
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,940
He's dead.

79
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,900
Chingu?

80
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,240
How is he dead?

81
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,900
He fell.

82
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,840
He fucking fell.

83
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh my god.

84
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,380
Wait, is that a car?

85
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,220
Wait, that's a car!

86
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,140
That guy got a car.

87
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,640
Wait, are you fighting them?

88
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,600
He's popping off.

89
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,060
Are you actually?

90
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,220
They're right here.

91
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,680
Wait, watch this.

92
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,300
Just stand here my gas.

93
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,960
Stand here my gas.

94
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,940
I cracked him.

95
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,720
He's flush.

96
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,660
Hey, I'm one.

97
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm kind of one.

98
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,220
He's one too.

99
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,780
He's leaving.

100
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Alright.

101
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,940
He can't see me.

102
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh!

103
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,640
He sees me!

104
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh my god.

105
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,340
I can't see.

106
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,620
He's going.

107
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,460
You can climb up here, stupid!

108
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,460
Now I'm just in the open.

109
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,560
You can climb up.

110
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,640
You should have climbed up.

111
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,780
I got one.

112
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,740
Wait, Pathfinder's up.

113
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,240
Bloodhound's one.

114
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:13,680
Bloodhound's one.

115
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm not standing.

116
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,250
Hey, I need help, Gumi.

117
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,050
This guy.

118
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,410
This one guy.

119
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:28,910
Just shoot him.

120
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,010
Don't let him...

121
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:30,790
I'm not standing.

122
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,230
He's cracked.

123
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,610
He doesn't have a gun.

124
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,510
You stupid...

125
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,190
Gumi, are you okay?

126
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,450
Are you okay, Gumi?

127
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:37,970
What do you mean, I'm okay?

128
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,970
What do you mean, I'm okay?

129
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,950
Bye, Gumi.

130
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,410
No, no, no.

131
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,950
Watch this.

132
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,390
Watch this.

133
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:45,930
Watch this.

134
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,650
Thanks for the blue.

135
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,990
Donkey, come back here and gas me then heal me.

136
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,530
Why am I crawling so fast?

137
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,950
Donkey.

138
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,530
He can't shoot me.

139
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,790
Wait.

140
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,930
Wait a minute, guys.

141
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,830
Gumi, I think they're coming over.

142
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,890
Why do you guys have to shoot it though?

143
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,030
Because, oh my god, look at my...

144
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,230
Look at this monster right here.

145
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,210
Alright, get in here.

146
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,130
Get in here, boys.

147
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,610
Oh my god, look at this.

148
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,430
Look at this.

149
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,390
Wait, can I fit there?

150
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,570
Look at this.

151
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,030
Oh my god, what the fuck?

152
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,460
Wait, where are they?

153
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,880
Wait, oh no, I don't know where...

154
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,720
I think the gas cans are lagging the car.

155
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,720
Oh shit.

156
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,260
Wait.

157
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,340
Look at that.

158
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm sorry.

159
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,830
I didn't know.

160
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,590
I didn't know.

161
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,670
I thought I would make it.

162
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,630
I thought I would make it.

163
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,130
I'm sorry.

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Me.

165
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay.

166
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Um.

167
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,120
I don't think I should drive, guys.

168
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm sorry.

169
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,520
I'm sorry.

170
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,980
It's a one by one car.

171
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,100
I have so much to cook.

172
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,550
I have some help here.

173
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,310
Yeah.

174
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,510
Where are they?

175
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,430
Where?

176
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,430
No, please.

177
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,090
Please.

178
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,590
What do you mean?

179
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,630
There's two?

180
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,290
Yes, I'm fucking...

181
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:01,730
Sento!

182
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,310
Please!

183
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,030
Sento!

184
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,820
Hey, can someone shoot at this man that is shooting at me?

185
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,560
Okay.

186
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,000
I did and I missed every shot.

187
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,240
I just want you to know.

188
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,740
And I have this.

189
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,120
I did and I missed every shot.

190
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm so sorry.

191
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,900
Who the fuck told me to play Caustic?

192
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,760
Who's wrong with you guys?

193
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,120
You.

194
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,700
Me too.

195
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,980
Wait, what the fuck?

196
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,340
Yo!

197
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,780
I can walk up top.

198
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,640
Hey, Kumi.

199
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm taking your shit above you.

200
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,880
Please.

201
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,280
Please.

202
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,620
It's just an armor.

203
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,060
Don't worry.

204
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,700
Please.

205
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,100
All you have been doing is bringing me pain.

206
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,140
Pain and suffering.

207
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,520
And love.

208
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
You love me, right?

209
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
I love you.

210
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,680
Alright, who wants to get in?

211
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,240
Alright, guys.

212
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:01,860
Get in.

213
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,520
Get in, Kumi.

214
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:04,980
Please!

215
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,720
Kumi,

216
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,360
get in.

217
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,420
Oh, wait.

218
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,980
Kumi, get in.

219
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,420
Hey, Sento, get in.

220
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:14,900
See?

221
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,880
Sento trusted me.

222
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,540
She's gonna run me over.

223
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,240
I can't run you over like that.
