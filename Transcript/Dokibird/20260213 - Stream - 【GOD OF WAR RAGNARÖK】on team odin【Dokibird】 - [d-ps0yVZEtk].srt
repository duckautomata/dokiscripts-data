time but i really really want to make progress on god of war

2
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:59,400

know, this God of War 2 and God of War, well, it's really

4
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,040
hard to see what the number of it, because it's not
technically God of War 5, it's like God of War Ragnarok is

5
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,840
longer than the last God of War, so we gotta make as much
progress as we can.

6
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,980
I might do a long stream today.

7
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,680
I don't know, I'm not sure.

8
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,040
I mean, tomorrow I don't have a stream tomorrow.

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,900
No more special surprises or special events or anything.

23
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,080
It's just normal streams for a while.

24
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,860

they're doing is really good so far especially when we're

when we did that preview stream a couple of days ago It was

saying how Jetpack Cat has been banned almost every rank

touch him like

73
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:37,700

him up um but yeah apparently he's been like uh he's been

That, oh yeah, that's, is that, oh, that's the alt.

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,660
That's, I'm sorry, I've been hearing everyone saying the,
like, the English way of saying it that I forgot the Chinese

89
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,300
way.

90
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,420
Any, yeah, that's the alt.

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,880
You know, everyone always call it a cheaper town hall.

92
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,840
Like, that's how I associate the alt now because that's what
everyone says.

93
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm like, oh, shit, that's the official, that's the official
way.

94
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:32,780
It's been so long since I heard this uh they call it they
call it cheap uh cheaper town hall um whenever like any rank

95
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:40,800
player or pro player use iron fist all they um they always
shout out cheaper town hall and it's now so ingrained in my

96
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,100
head that i legitimately forgot what the official what the
official alt line is uh

97
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,020
a war time let's go oh my gosh also i just found out you
know how it's actually crazy that they announced a remaster

98
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:09,240
uh or like not remastered the remakes actually uh the
remakes of god the original god of war trilogy i thought it

99
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,280
was really funny that after they announced that they
announced the prequel of uh god of war and then the voice

100
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,700
actor is kid itchorus

101
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,120
What's the word?

102
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,700
It's just like, oh, man, like a huge, like a little, like,
what the fuck?

103
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,280
Why is Kid Icarus created?

104
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,840
Kid Icarus before his family got killed.

105
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,340
Yeah, it was such a whiplash.

106
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,320
I was like, wait a minute.

107
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Is that, is that Pitt?

108
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:52,380
Before, before like, you know, he was, he had, he's still at
hope and whimsy in his heart before the gods killed his

109
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,940
family.

110
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,220
Anyway, let's go play God of War.

111
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,120
Let's see if I can remember the controls.

112
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,360
It's a little fun game.

113
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
Will Doki Bird remember the controls?

114
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,500
Or will it take her five hours to figure everything out
again?

115
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,260
What a fun game.

116
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,420
Alright, 6.5.

117
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,820
What is that?

118
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
Is that the God of War?

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,620
Yeah, that is.

120
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,100
6.5.

121
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,450
Alright.

122
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,690
And then.

123
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,650
Here's my God of War stream.

124
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,010
Hello.

125
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,170
This is running.

126
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,850
Am I God of War?

127
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,770
Come on.

128
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,210
Azura, thank you for the super chat.

129
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:44,430
Thank you.

130
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:44,950
Thank you.

131
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,490
Any plans on the upcoming Lunar New Year?

132
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,150
I really want to go to.

133
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,950
I want to go to.

134
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,270
I really want to go to like.

135
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,410
There's usually like Lunar New Year markets around town and
stuff.

136
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,350
I really want to go to one.

137
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,710
I want to see a lion dance.

138
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,330
It's been so long since I saw a lion dance live.

139
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,270
And I definitely want to go to one again.

140
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,210
I want to see the lions eat a cabbage.

141
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,230
I love it when you feed a cabbage to the lions.

142
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,450
And they go, I'm yum, yum, yum, yum.

143
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,750
It's one of my favorite parts.

144
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,970
And also like the...

145
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:29,990
when they do the little acrobat's and oh yes moon cakes I
love the ice cream moon cakes the most oh and they're like

146
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:38,230
they're my go-to I'm not a huge fan of the egg yolk ones but
I love the uh yeah they absolutely destroy that cabbage like

147
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,930
a cookie like cookie monster with cookies they're like yum
yum yum cabbage

148
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:55,850
um but my favorite I I personally I'm not because I'm not a
fan of egg yolk like um um in general uh so like even like

149
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,890
even like if it's just the yolk itself whenever i eat hard
boiled eggs i just eat the egg whites i literally just like

150
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:07,130
not even even if it's like that's why i only eat scrambled
eggs i don't even like sunny side up or anything because i

151
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:15,330
just hate the taste of yolk in general even if it's cooked
or like fully cooked or like semi-raw um i'm just not a huge

152
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:23,090
fan of the yolk itself so like i'm not so i would just every
time i eat like hard boiled egg Parents forced me to eat

153
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,910
hard-boiled egg.

154
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:31,030
I just, like, eat the egg whites on the outside and then
just, like, gave my mom, like, egg yolk, the yolk itself.

155
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,470
And also, like, so, like, for mooncakes, that's why I'm not
a huge fan of the egg yolk in the mooncake itself.

156
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,550
So every time, like, I get mooncakes, I always get the ice
cream version of them because they're so good.

157
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,690
Or, like, the mochi version.

158
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,190
Anyway.

159
00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:01,190
more god of war time but uh but that's my like personal

rivals recently released a new update for uh they uh they

town square town square and also um like traditional lunar

166
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:11,340
new year music you hear about discord i heard people are uh
pulling up vr chat to pretend to do the identification of

167
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:21,280
discord it just could be like yes that is a real person like
Do you guys see that?

168
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,160
Or, gee, my brother, do you...

169
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,180
Yes, they're like, yes, this is a real person.

170
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,660
You pass.

171
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,800
Yes, you can do that.

172
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,420
You can pull up, like, a 3D model and just, like, and then
use it as the verification.

173
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,940
Like, it's like, what's the point?

174
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,680
Yo, yo, yeah, apparently someone used to have stranding.

175
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,060
Quiet.

176
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,800
She is a friend.

177
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,860
Better they get this from you.

178
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Watch this.

179
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,800
Once the wolves have the scent of the norns, we'll just need
to follow their lead.

180
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,130
I will open the gate.

181
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,080
Oh, why are you whining?

182
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,180
Their fur is matted.

183
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,760
When did you last brush them?

184
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,960
They are wolves.

185
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
They don't need...

186
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,980
They don't need brushes.

187
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,000
They're woes.

188
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
They're not domesticated yet.

189
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,980
How the fuck were they able to clean their fur before I was
here, huh?

190
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,160
You don't need my help.

191
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,780
They're strong independent woes.

192
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,380
They are dogs.

193
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,180
That takes us hundreds of years.

194
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,680
Domestication is not that fast.

195
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,840
Also, do you guys hear people are slowly domesticating
raccoons?

196
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,700
Apparently, like, raccoons are showing...

197
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:59,540
signs of domestication how i may find my son i don't exactly
remember like what the traits were but like apparently uh

198
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,520
scientists are like yeah raccoons are now showing signs of
domestication demise you didn't tell me you had a death

199
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:16,520
prophecy when atreus and i reached yodenheim we found a
hidden mural the giants pay herself had foreseen our entire

200
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,560
journey long ago yeah what were the signs do you guys
remember i don't remember i just remember it on twitter

201
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:31,020
because that's how i get all my news now that image was from
a time yet to come i see you've never struck me as someone

202
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:40,240
who fears death that's not the problem is it no oh short and
snow oh yeah short and snow i don't understand what the

203
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:52,120
benefits are what's the what are the benefits for like the
snow to be shorter and you're still not sure why speak of

204
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,600
this no further is it because they look cuter so it makes
people want to take care of them more yeah i was gonna say

205
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,700
it i knew it i was like is it because like they're trying to
make themselves look cuter so people would give them more

206
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:12,160
food that makes so much it's like cats you know cats meow
just for humans right they don't actually use meows to

207
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:23,080
communicate in um to other cats meowing is just to make to
benefit the uh when there's barking and some increases when

208
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:32,440
nearing the source oh what is this yeah so they meow only
because uh only to make us like care for them more what is

209
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,400
this how do i do this again we don't have the equipment for
this oh

210
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:46,200
yeah it was for it's literally capped care baiting yeah they
only meow to us and make sure we take care of them or defeat

211
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:53,700
them they does have made themselves quite at home yeah
they'll leave me out at us so they could get fed by us she

212
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:01,200
speaks highly of that fight as well you know of that she
told me all about it when she found me out take care of me

213
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:14,140
I'm a cute cat and it works every time I'm the Valkyrie
Queen as Segrin was stubbornly determined to remind me I

214
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,780
don't fucking know where to go.

215
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,240
My dog is not barking excitedly.

216
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,080
He's so loyal.

217
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:20,900
Why?

218
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,000
Why?

219
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,980
Oh, what's that over there?

220
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,480
Mm-hmm.

221
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,520
Doesn't take a love goddess to see where you're coming from.

222
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
Oh, that's the portal.

223
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,820
The spread of fate we are tracing.

224
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,800
It's not somebody's life if that's what you mean.

225
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,940
The Norns use it to mark their way when they're outside of
the well.

226
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,660
The Norns live in a well.

227
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:43,700
No.

228
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:53,760
the well of earth their home is i don't know where to go
where's the compass it's in no fixed place entrances come oh

229
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:02,260
gosh a place holy under their influence that's over here
where the intangible becomes tangible bless me being inside

230
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:09,180
your own mind hold that thought i think it's about to get
violent oh my god i do not remember how to play this game

231
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,380
Okay, it's fine.

232
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,720
It's fine!

233
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,940
JK, I do remember!

234
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,360
Get out of here!

235
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Oh shit, I did not mean to be...

236
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,680
Okay, alright, rage attack.

237
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,680
I did not mean to go full rage mode, okay.

238
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,780
We'll stop here.

239
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,320
Nice.

240
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,520
Is he okay?

241
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,740
Oh, he is not okay.

242
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,900
Oh, shit.

243
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Hey.

244
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,100
What the fuck?

245
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,180
He's like, I'll take you down with me.

246
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,360
And then I just walked five steps back.

247
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,020
These were coal raiders.

248
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,920
Infamous for you.

249
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Eating wolves.

250
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,980
Atreus and I rescued ours from such an encampment.

251
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:03,820
Oh.

252
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,040
Kind of you.

253
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,680
The coal raiders have been a plight on this land.

254
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,820
The way they've abused its creatures.

255
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,520
Oh, that's fucked.

256
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:22,660
something about that psychopathic behavior up to you brother
if the norms know the future we'll expect us to show up a

257
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:29,520
bit later oh my god wait did they think oh no my dog they're
just like remember to go back to where your dogs are okay

258
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:38,100
but where the fuck are the fates all right limited one okay
all right i got one of the cabs the norms domain is like

259
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:46,580
being inside your mind maybe here like the sound of that Is
this where I came from?

260
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,800
I don't know!

261
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,020
I'm looking at their ways of discouraging visitation.

262
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,060
I'm looking at their heads!

263
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,720
I wouldn't talk about what he found.

264
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,760
Alright, where is your head?

265
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Okay.

266
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,840
Left!

267
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,420
Okay.

268
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,040
Where is it?

269
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,700
Where is it, boy?

270
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,640
Right!

271
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,080
Alright.

272
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,740
Oh my god, the heads are compass, guys.

273
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,280
The head is compass!

274
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,720
Like waking up from a dream.

275
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,300
Forward.

276
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,700
Mainly, I remember that nothing could be done to change my
son's fate.

277
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,700
Which only made me more determined to try.

278
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,260
Okay forward.

279
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,060
Okay, but what's over here though?

280
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,520
Ooh.

281
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,300
What of your story?

282
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,060
Luke.

283
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,760
You face the fates of your homeland, yes?

284
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,420
Oh.

285
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,000
It's okay.

286
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,260
Oh, that's not okay.

287
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,660
It's okay.

288
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,660
I saved it for this!

289
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,960
Bam!

290
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,200
Okay, um, that's awkward.

291
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,440
I need you to be a little closer.

292
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,040
He's being a little closer so I can punch you

293
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,840
Okay, that's good

294
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,340
It's fine Oh fuck, I forgot you can't dodge that Oh fuck, I

297
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,730

She just watched me get my shit kicked in!

299
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,570
Ma'am!

300
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,210
That's fucked up.

301
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,190
You all saw that.

302
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,650
She literally just watched me get myself beat up.

303
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,490
Like, I thought she was supposed to be an ally.

304
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,330
Come on, that's not fair.

305
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,630
Okay.

306
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,290
Oh, that's fine.

307
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,110
That's fine.

308
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,050
That's fine.

309
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,630
That's fine.

310
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,550
I'm slowly trying to remember.

311
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,330
Lock in, please!

312
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,210
There you go.

313
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,530
What?

314
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,690
How did I hit me?

315
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,170
Okay.

316
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,530
Okay, that's not fair.

317
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,850
That is actually not fair.

318
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,670
Please, ma'am.

319
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,530
Guys, I don't think I...

320
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,370
Okay, there you go.

321
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,490
There you go.

322
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,630
Oh, my God.

323
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,330
It's fine.

324
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,230
Come on.

325
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,910
How did you unlock yourself?

326
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,530
No!

327
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,420
Holy shit.

328
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,660
Okay, this guy is hard.

329
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,620
I swear to God, if this loot isn't worth it, I swear to
fucking God, I'm going to be so sad.

330
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm going to save it, actually.

331
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,360
I'm just going to save it.

332
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,010
Fuck it.

333
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,620

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,460
lock itself again.

340
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,740

341
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,140
It's okay.

342
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,480
It's okay.

343
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:29,840
I have rage.

344
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,200
I have rage.

345
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
I can get my HP back with this.

346
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,280
Okay, it's okay.

347
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,280
Kept my rage for the HP.

348
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,820
It's worth it.

349
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,500
There you go.

350
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,440

351
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,160

Okay, we did it.

377
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,960
Reminds me of tales of a cruel empress.

378
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,540
Oh, that was close.

379
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,600

381
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,600
You weren't supposed to do that.

382
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,860
You weren't supposed to blow up.

383
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,020
Like, six to a story is true form.

384
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:07,840
Oh, my God.

385
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,060
I don't think I'm going to be able to collect.

386
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,460
Wait, what?

387
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,560

388
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,300
That's not where I left the dog.

389
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
Or is that the...

390
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,160
Ah.

391
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,960
Just a little pesky guys.

00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,760
Now, brother.

393
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,560
What about when you face the fates of Greece?

394
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,640
The legends I heard about the ghost of Sparta were...

395
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,040
What the fuck is the angle on this?

396
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,980

397
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,760
Oh, oh my god, that's nice.

398
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,400
It's like an Uber.

399
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:49,540
once lost it's strange stability obviously i mean a rumor
about thor knocking the world itself back in history from

400
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:57,120
ragnarok is one thing it is the truth the threads of fate
span all life and time like my uber wolves seems a fate

401
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,540
abused their power when i challenged them they threatened to
undo my existence so i killed them and turned their power on

402
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:13,520
zeus that's the most dangerous and irresponsible thing i've
ever heard these noons have no such magic Nor does anyone in

403
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,280
these realms that I've ever seen.

404

Why is the fire rainbow?

411
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,100
An abandoned kin.

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,580
Whoever was here left long ago.

413
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,200

It was level one.

438
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,780
It's awkward.

439
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,400
Oops.

I'm frozen right now.

460
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,050
Fires is strong against ice now.

461
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,910
That's what they told me.

462
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,070
Oh, shit.

463
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,290
Oh, my God.

464
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,630
He's just, like, tanking it.

465
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,270
He doesn't care.

466
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,310
Holy shit, he does not care.

467
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,970
Okay, there's five.

468
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,410
It's five.

469
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:13,870
That's okay.

470
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,370
That's good.

471
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,170
That is good.

472
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,810
That's why I didn't kill them first.

473
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,990
Alright.

474
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,570
Where's the last guy?

475
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,950
See, I know my type advantage, guys.

476
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,050
Anyway, I really need heals.

477
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,350
Oh, God.

478
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,890
Splat.

479
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,490
Explode!

480
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,780
There you go.

481
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,420
See?

482
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,920
Fires put against.

483
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,520
Ice.

484
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,400
The way forward is magically sealed.

485
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,060
Something in here is giving it power.

486
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,320
Maybe this?

487
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,640
The hilt of a sword.

488
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,740
Brother, I know that sword hilt.

489
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,360
Tread carefully.

490
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,240
You of all people know how weapons can carry ghosts.

491
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,480
Oh.

492
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh, we did it.

493
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,660
If it does not help us find the sword hilt of King Raki, is
a man worn as once contained great power.

494
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:19,900
Oh!

495
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,200
Hey, free stuff.

496
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,540
I feel a trace of their illusions here.

497
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,940
I can try to dismantle it.

498
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,460
Alright, nice.

499
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,020
Alright, greed, woman.

500
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,180
Wait, what's over here?

501
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,440
Okay, we gotta make the shortcut.

502
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,320
Okay, nice.

503
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,100
There's also a little portal too.

504
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,760
We'll have to see what else the wolves can find.

505
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,340
Typical Nornish mischief.

506
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,100
They know we're searching.

507
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,140
I warned you they wouldn't make it easy.

508
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,900
Oh, there's nothing here.

509
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,800
And what's the health of a cursed king?

510
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,420
I asked her to read because I'm illiterate and she's smarter
than me because she's a woman that can read.

511
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,440
I suppose they'd say we were fair.

512
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,800
And I'm man that go ungabunga.

513
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,040
My son didn't teach me how to read.

514
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:30,140
wait what do you guys think I said I said read woman so to
be clear finding the norms is not about altering events yeah

515
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:38,060
I only want information yeah what did you guys hear it's

516
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:51,230
this way the Vikings thought matters Half was woman's work.

517
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,980
Numbers hard.

518
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,040
Tell me more of your homeland.

519
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,740
It was violent and cruel.

520
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,220
Sounds no different from these lands.

521
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,300
It was warmer when mines.

522
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,280
Read disembodied head.

523
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,160
How come everyone knows how to read but me?

524
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:17,680
Too bad.

525
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,220
Tear has no interest in doing either these days.

526
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:31,350
that's crazy that's such a crazy statement what do the
vikings what what did the vikings know

527
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,960
all right we go this way

528
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:57,680

to go to this path And then their heads returning to the

534
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:35,720

something in this direction feel what exactly another

541
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,560
I'd be like, who the fuck was that?

542
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,520
It's like when you're at a haunted house and you have to
sign like a little weaver to be like, please, um, you know,

543
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,340
this search will only get more dangerous.

544
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:20,460
Whereas like, uh, you're not- We're like, if you
accidentally get the jump-scared actors, but can you try to

545
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,380
scare you and punch one of the actors?

546
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,260
And you're like, you're liable if you punch one of the
actors.

547
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,600
What is up here?

548
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,260
I don't feel anything.

549
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,360
It's not related to the Norns.

550
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,020
Could be interesting enough in its own right.

551
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,840
What's that outpost?

552
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,060
Oh, another hidden region.

553
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,560
Oh, hey!

554
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,660
At your service.

555
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,840
Was there anything good?

556
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,860
Not really.

557
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,600
I feel like I have all the good shit already.

558
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,760
Yeah.

559
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,840
Anything for Freya?

560
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,640
Uh...

561
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,220
I'll disinfect my tools.

562
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,160
I don't have any materials, too.

563
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,880
I'm broke.

564
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,100
I'm actually broke.

565
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,420
No, I looked.

566
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,420
I can't upgrade anything.

567
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,020
I'm sorry, but you'd have to ask Odin.

568
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,340
He's got control of every path.

569
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,720
I know how highly you esteem our expertise on such things,
so I'm sure that's disappointing.

570
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,620
He's just been one step ahead of us.

571
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,300
Okay, that's how you swap weapons.

572
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,240
Okay, I was trying to remember how to swap weapons.

573
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,480
I was like, I was like, anyways, I was smashing every button
except for, like, swap weapons.

574
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,340
I don't believe it, Namir.

575
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,200
This crest belongs to Fjotorloom.

576
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,460
Fjotorloom?

577
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:49,840
You see?

578
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,920
Now that's where Sikron was from.

579
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,220
What the loom?

580
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,180
Another crane.

581
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,960
Go!

582
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,020
Oh, we go this way.

583
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,700
Seems it only rotates in the other direction.

584
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,200
That's fine.

585
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,540
I made it to the other side.

586
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,120
What's this?

587
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,300
Oh, wait, this way.

588
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,140
Oh?

589
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,100
Wait, how do I kill this?

590
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,120
Oh, I just...

591
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,800
Bro...

592
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,820
That's how.

593
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,700
Dude, let me chuck my axe at it.

594
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,620
Wait, what the fuck?

595
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,220
Oh.

596
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,720
Oh, yeah, I need your arrows.

597
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,560
I thought it was all me.

598
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,100
I'm sorry.

599
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,700
I was like, damn, all me.

600
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,950
Alright, nice.

601
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,030
Alright, read.

602
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,290
Another sleeping troll, courtesy of the dwarves.

603
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,240
Alright.

604
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,580
They have free XP, though.

605
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,900
Is there anything over here?

606
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,100
Oh, no.

607
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,860
There has to be a shortcut for this.

608
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,400
Alright.

609
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,920
Then we go this way.

610
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,280
Yay!

611
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:05,980
Oh, loot!

612
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,840
So this outpost is what's left of Fjordland.

613
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,120
Seagrin spoke of growing up with these people before she
joined the Valkyries.

614
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,200
Oh, more loot.

615
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,540
Wait, how do I...

616
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,740
I have to move this here.

617
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,720
Yay, loot!

618
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,540
Okay, more crafting material.

619
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,520
I didn't need that.

620
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,620
Oh, how do I get over there?

621
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,120
Oh my god, I'm like in a side quest of a side quest right
now.

622
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,880
What the fuck?

623
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,400
Oh, what the fuck?

624
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,300
I was just watching!

625
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,900
What the fuck?

626
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,300
What the fuck am I not allowed to watch?

627
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,820
That's fucked up.

628
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,700
I was like, are you okay, lady?

629
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,440
Like...

630
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,600
I was just very concerned.

631
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,500
She was...

632
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,920
Wait, I was like, is there a doctor in here?

633
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,100
And then she exploded.

634
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,710
Okay, it's this way.

635
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,470
No, I can't already use it from here.

636
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,970
No, I have to push all the way up.

637
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,130
Yeah, I was trying to help, but now...

638
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,430
Now I guess you die.

639
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,170
See, guys, there's no benefits to helping people.

640
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:44,670
Look at that.

641
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:47,690
What was the point of helping, guys?

642
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,770
That's why I should never help.

643
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,780
What the fuck?

644
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,860
They shoot him!

645
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,180
Oh, he's gone.

646
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,700
Oh, wait.

647
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,240
No, never mind.

648
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,360
Oh, that's a lot of enemies.

649
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,200
Whoa, shit!

650
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,800
Okay, I did not expect that.

651
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,800
Alright, that's good.

652
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,420
Not me, though.

653
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:15,960
Not me.

654
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,220
Not me.

655
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,440
As long as it's not me.

656
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,260
Alright.

657
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,260
Nice.

658
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,220
Alright, everything's okay.

659
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,760
Oh shit, that's a dead body.

660
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,390
Bro, you're tanking.

661
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,490
Finally, she's doing her job.

662
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:46,950
Is there anything back here?

663
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,450
I knew it.

664
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:48,690
Ah!

665
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:51,070
God, fucking, damn it.

666
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,910
God, damn, I hate it.

667
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,110
They're like fucking costumes.

668
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,990
Now I can't even trust dead bodies no more.

669
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,110
I can't trust nobody.

670
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,430
This is how you get trust issues.

671
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:11,050
Good, that's the way.

672
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,790
I mean, that's fine.

673
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,510
Oops, not that, though.

674
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,050
Okay, but...

675
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:27,410
Hey, wait.

676
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,010
No.

677
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:29,790
Where?

678
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:35,930
You know, brother, Seekran told me her kingdom housed a
great treasury filled with the spoils of her family's

679
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,510
conquests.

680
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,410
Perhaps this uncle was told some of that treasure.

681
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,750
Is that all she told you, Mamir?

682
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,270
Did she say where?

683
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,650
No, just that they kept it hidden.

684
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,130
All right.

685
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,330
What?

686
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:57,410
You can't do it here or here.

687
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,430
Oh, maybe I can, oh, okay, there you go.

688
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:05,530
That's right.

689
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,510
All on purpose, too.

690
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,870
I planned.

691
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,830
100% planned.

692
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,030
Okay, I have to raise this then.

693
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:15,830
I lower it.

694
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,330
Lower it?

695
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:19,710
I do.

696
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,430
Okay, if I lower it and then I go...

697
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,650
Where is that too low?

698
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,390
Huh.

699
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:30,850
Not too low.

700
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,610
I'm about to find out.

701
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:33,870
Oh.

702
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,290
Oh, there we go.

703
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,030
Wait, can I use this?

704
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:41,410
No.

705
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:41,910
Okay.

706
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,380
It should be enough, right?

707
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah.

708
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,600
Well done.

00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,890
Oh, please read as many as you can.

717
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,070
So the sword is on.

What the fuck?

719
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,410
Why was he so surprised?

720
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,890
It's just like, what?

721
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,890
A key to what?

722
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,520
Wonder what lock that key belongs to.

723
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,620
Oh my God, it's a side quest within a side quest.

724
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,740
Within a side quest.

725
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:32,180
end when does it end what do you mean I did all that it
never ends okay

726
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:45,670

stuck in a side quest of a side quest of a side quest oh my

00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,110
God and What's the point?

728
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,870
I did all that.

729
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,130
What the fuck?

730
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,430
What is he doing here?

731
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:58,010
Oh my god.

732

Oopsie.

733
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:00,730
That's not fair.

734
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,250
Wait, that's not fair.

735
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:06,690
Oh no, fair guys.

736
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:07,890
Help me!

737
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,650
Oh my god, he just disappeared.

00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:15,990
Oh my god.

00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:16,930
Wait, that's not fair.

740
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,510
Oh my god, this is not fair.

741
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:23,850
He's not expecting this.

742
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:29,650
Oh, God.

743
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,430
I'm not okay.

744
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,030
I am not okay.

745
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,230
Okay.

746
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,370
I have the power of fire.

747
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,270
Oh, God.

748
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:40,930
Oh, God.

749
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:41,670
Oh, God.

750
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:42,530
Okay, it's okay.

751
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,750
Okay, it's fine.

752
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,210
Last one.

753
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:52,730
Okay.

754
00:50:52,850 --> 00:51:05,450

nobody dropped heels that's cool I didn't want heels anyway

755
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:20,200

named Helgi seems they were madly in love oh no wouldn't let

756
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:30,900

first love did you i suppose i did guys this is a little

757
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:46,080
awkward but i thought i could be like pretend to be like oh
yeah but i might have forgot who she is um this i didn't

758
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:54,300
want to say anything at first but apparently she was an
important person in the story so um who was she again

759
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:11,200
who was who was her what was she oh the valkyrie queen wait
but i thought she was the valkyrie queen there was another

760
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:21,880
oh i never yeah i never met her i was just like they talk
about her like she was very important but like who was she

761
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:34,780
quest oh yeah pasto he was not was not up for that the
wolves have picked up another trail keep following their

762
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:42,680
heads oh prayer was the first queen oh okay that makes she
was the first queen and then so you're gonna replace her and

763
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:51,480
now i guess there's there's another valkyrie oh my gosh all
right wolves tell me where to go this way oh

764
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:04,790
I was secret when you saw last she's still incorporeal ever
since Kratos set her free of her corrupted form but she

765
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:13,270
hasn't let that stop her from helping any way she can hear
voices truth is I owe her more than I can repay I don't see

766
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:20,510
yeah when we freed her she could speak of little else but
her reverence for you seeing you yourself again would surely

767
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,230
be payment enough

768
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,290
But I do wonder though.

769
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,190
Oh my god.

770
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:29,810
Okay, guys.

773
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,270
She's tanking.

774
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,210
There we go.

775
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,350
I did it.

776
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:03,730
Yeah!

777
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:05,630
Where's the others?

778
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:08,090
Oh, shit.

779
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:08,990
What the fuck?

780
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,390
Where did she...

781
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,030
It's alright.

782
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,410
What is he gonna do now?

783
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,410
I'm at the edge.

784
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:16,010
That's right.

785
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,390
What are you looking at, huh?

786
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,030
Ah, cheese.

787
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:21,830
My beloved.

788
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,550
They're like, oh no.

789
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,090
She's off.

790
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,670
She's on the other side of the border.

791
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,370
What can I do now?

792
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,690
Stop hitting yourself.

793
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,250
There you go.

794
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,630
I actually needed this too.

795
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,230
Oh my god, there's more.

796
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,770
That's fine.

797
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:53,490
Like what are they gonna do hitting me?

798
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:54,370
Oh shit.

799
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,250
Okay, it's fine.

800
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:56,770
I made it.

801
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,850
There, I can literally just stay there.

802
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:03,950
His arm is not that strong.

803
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:10,390
Oh my god, he fucking carried my axe.

804
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:11,810
You can do that?

805
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,510
Okay, that's fine.

806
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,040
She just dodged it.

807
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,780
How did she do that?

808
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,480
Alright.

809
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,020
Alright.

810
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,800
All right, last guy.

811
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,580
All your friends are dead.

812
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,040
Boop.

813
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,100
Yeah.

814
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,960
Now I can open the loot box.

815
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,460
Is there any actual HP?

816
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,360
Okay.

817
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,480
At least I'm half HP again.

818
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,220
Oh, man.

819
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,040
If only all my fights are like that.

820
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,220
I have only...

821
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,120
Alright.

822
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,820
I was...

823
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,620
Poor things.

824
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,460
They can smell more danger.

825
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,580
They this way.

826
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,340
The horrors of our past can be inextricable from the
present.

827
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,980
You have to understand that.

828
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,920
Have I not been here already?

829
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,460
Wait, that's...

830
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,260
Wait, is that my...

831
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,000
Oh, he's here, too?

832
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,640
What the fuck?

833
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,840
Okay, it's this way.

834
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,200
Alright.

835
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,780
I figured it out.

836
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,000
This has to be the last place.

837
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,520
I must say, I think we make a good team.

838
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,980
With my brains, Kratos is drawn, and my lady's...

839
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,220
Wisdom.

840
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,520
Magic?

841
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,320
Yeah, how's he gonna say, magic?

842
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,620
For long periods of time?

843
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,560
I was going to say brutality.

844
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,800
That works.

845
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,720
What's over here?

846
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh, yeah.

847
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,800
It was just a nice little hole.

848
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,880
It was a very pretty hole, though.

849
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,060
Very well carved.

850
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,120
Oh?

851
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,520
We need to work our way up.

852
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,440
This way.

853
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,580
I light that up.

854
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,420
For me?

855
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,600
Oh, there's two more.

856
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,280
What would the other two be?

857
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,620
Guess up top?

858
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,520
Yeah, oh, there it is.

859
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,180
Wait, how do I get over there?

860
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,740
Wait, but there's a chest over there.

861
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,200
How do I get over there?

862
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:55,500
Yeah?

863
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,040
I want to go there, though.

864
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,420
What the fuck?

865
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,200
How do I get over there?

866
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,400
I'm so confused.

867
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:16,780
use.

868
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,160
Can you cut away through the ice?

869
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:22,520
Oh, are the non-flaping magical ice walls now?

870
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,660
Oh, I see it.

871
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,800
I think the water just froze.

872
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,220
Right here.

873
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,300
Oh, there you go.

874
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,460
I see it.

875
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,320
A little stick.

876
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:42,180
Okay, now I need to find the last last pot.

877
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,120
I don't see any more pots, though.

878
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:55,480
Unless is all the way up there maybe gotta fucking climb
back up oh no it dropped down oh i have to drop oh my god i

879
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:06,380
have to do this all over again all right what would the last
pot be

880
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,360
i don't understand oh it's right here nice

881
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,680
drop down again.

882
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,500
I gotta grab my loot.

883
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,800
Alright.

884
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:24,860
Nice.

885
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,180
Yay!

886
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,340
Alright.

887
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,200
Loot required.

888
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,040
Alright, bye go.

889
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:39,200
Oop.

890
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,240
Oop.

891
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,520
Go this way.

892
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,180
And then...

893
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,620
How do I freeze this?

894
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,340
Oh, this is how.

895
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,480
Or like, chop it, I guess.

896
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,580
I'm gonna say, I don't unfreeze it.

897
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,020
I mean, I have a fireblade.

898
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,780
I feel like I would use a fireblade instead.

899
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,020
But, I mean, that works, right?

900
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,360
Oh, fuck it.

901
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,260
Oh, no, I have to run to him!

902
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,060
No, I wasted all my fucking rage because I have to run to
him!

903
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,240
Oh, my God.

904
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:19,860
What a waste.

905
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,380
Let's hope there's no boss here.

906
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,780
That would be so awkward.

907
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,000
Alright, it would be very awkward if after this I have a
boss fight.

908
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,380
But...

909
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,580
Not that they have any idea.

910
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,480
That's what they're doing.

911
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,220
Oh, nice.

912
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,300
I actually need more heal.

913
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,760
Oh, I don't need more heals.

914
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,800
I'm actually full HP.

915
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,940
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

916
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,580
Thank you.

Thank you.

918
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:46,500
Boy.

919
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,640
Well, his son ditched him for a cool.

920
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:58,420
dad because he didn't because Kratos didn't buy him the new
iPhone and then Odin was like wow that's such a shitty dad I

921
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:12,520
would buy you that new iPhone and now my son ditched me and
valued possessions over thank you over honor just trying to

Boiled by fucked up.

924
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,980
He wanted, all he wanted was the newest aqua.

925
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,980
He didn't care.

926
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,340
And the flying sword.

927
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,400
Oh yeah, and the flying talking sword.

928
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,840
Okay.

929
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,780

voices say hearing that creepy was i knew i wasn't crazy in

01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,250
Alright, there you go.

950
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:39,870
Heavy attack.

951
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,350
Oh my god, you're so fucking weak!

952
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:49,530
This place almost looks familiar.

953
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:51,110
But different.

954
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:53,110
Alright, nice.

955
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,430
I'm gonna save my rage in case there's...

956
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:57,350
I'm gonna try to save my rage.

957
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:59,110
I feel like there might be a boss fight soon.

958
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:06,650
So you're allowed to hear voices and talk about, but what I
do have to be put on meds and go to therapy Archer is

959
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,610
thinking of a super chat.

960
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:07,990
Thank you.

961
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:08,730
Thank you.

962
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:15,030
I think Kratos is already going through a lot right now

963
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,080
I think he's at the stage where he needs more than just
therapy and meds

964
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,840
What the fuck okay?

965
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:42,180
I don't know if you saw that, but he punched the cat.

966
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:55,140
Wait, she healed himself.

967
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:56,480
That's an ego.

968
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,170
All right, get out of here.

969
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:04,870
No more res is for you.

970
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,420
her and that cat.

971
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,020
They had history.

972
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,020
I literally saw her punch the cat.

973
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,380
She didn't even use magic.

974
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,180
I was just like, holy shit.

975
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,720
That's crazy.

976
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,560
I actually don't need to get close to them.

977
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,940
Get out of here.

978
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,320
Oh my god.

979
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,440
Freya's actually tanking for me for once.

980
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,460
I'm literally the DPS and she's the tank.

981
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,680
Alright, oh, actually over here.

982
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,040
How do I get there?

983
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,140
Alright, I want to get to that loot.

984
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,020
Alright, take for me!

985
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,520
Oh no, not the fucking magic.

986
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,040
Here we go.

987
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,900
Counselor to Kings.

988
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,720
Mary Wanderer of the Woods.

989
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,320
Robin of the Goodfellows.

990
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,320
Let me guess.

991
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:12,880
I'm a long-winded noot.

992
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,800

996
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:55,940
I thought we had an agreement.

997
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,100
Toxic.

998
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,060
Hey, I got shot at.

999
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,940
She didn't do her job as being a tank.

1000
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,700
At least we won't have to introduce ourselves.

1001
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,020
Don't credit your reputation, Mimir.

1002
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,120
They see the whole lives of any who approach them.

Okay, that makes sense.

Nice.

1016
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,300
She's taking it?

1017
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,580
I'm glad she's taking it for me.

1018
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,560
I really appreciate it.

1019
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:39,270
Oh my god.

1020
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,410
I'm trying!

1021
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,970
Wait, you're so far!

1022
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,170
Wait, where did she go?

1023
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:52,790
Okay, I missed.

1024
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:53,770
We missed.

1025
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:56,410
Oh, shit!

1026
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,270
You're alright, brother.

1027
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:00,730
Oh, nice.

1028
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,390
There you go.

1029
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,450
Okay, nice.

1030
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,190
We gotta go to the shrine.

1031
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,850
It's so far!

1032
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,370
Is that like fair?

1033
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,370
It was like 20 miles away.

1034
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,250
Oh, finish it off, man!

1035
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:22,230
Alright, nice.

1036
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:24,370
Okay, this boss fight was easy.

1037
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:29,190
They literally put the stride on the other side of the map.

1038
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:33,810
Well, yet another gift of Fimblewinter, I suppose.

1039
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:34,610
Yeah!

1040
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,790
Okay, that was the easiest boss out of all of them.

1041
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:41,350
Holy shit, he gave so much fucking loot.

1042
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:51,740
Literally had like, like kindergarten attack pattern.

1043
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,380
I guess you could say the phantom felt phantom pain.

1044
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,440
But I'm...

1045
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,220
Thank you.

1046
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,200
Thank you for the super chat.

1047
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:01,520
Thank you.

1048
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:02,180
Thank you.

1049
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:02,780
This way.

1050
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,880
Yeah, his entire body was just loot.

1051
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,200
It was like a little pinata.

1052
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,700
Pinata.

1053
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,320
Oh, I'm going to keep that.

1054
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,020
I don't need heals right now for once.

1055
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,420
I'm actually...

1056
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,600
I'm actually so healthy.

1057
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,240
Okay.

1058
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,640
Kratos does not need health insurance.

1059
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:33,540
He's a man of health.

1060
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,180
He's that healthy.

1061
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,860
He's the symbol.

1062
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,080
The symbol of fitness.

1063
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,300
There's that itchy sound again.

1064
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,200
Normally, I don't mind ladies whispering in my ear.

1065
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,380
But this is positively arson.

1066
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,440
Anyone ever tell you that you babble when you're terrified?

1067
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,320
Terrified?

1068
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,820
Ooh, it's pretty dark.

1069
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,600
I'll have you know I'm the very most deeply apprehensive.

1070
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,320
Making tension with humor is the sacred duty of a traveling
companion.

1071
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,980
How very dare you, babbling.

1072
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:15,200
Trying to distract himself from being from being a pussy
right now.

1073
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,320
A door.

1074
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,660
Oh, a door.

1075
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:18,740
That looks official.

1076
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,500
Where does this door lead me to?

1077
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,440
I guess the phantom wasn't really a menace, but I'm...

1078
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,200
Mr. Broken Bond!

1079
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:32,660
Whoa!

1080
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1081
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:36,640
Thank you.

1082
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:36,880
Thank you.

1083
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:38,340
Thank you.

1084
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:38,380
Stop.

1085
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,720
Why did you bring him here?

1086
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,060
You are not welcome here.

1087
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:43,740
Wait.

1088
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,040
Vulture come back.

1089
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,140
Oh, shit.

1090
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,840
They're not real.

1091
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,700
Freya, wake up.

1092
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,660
They're not real.

1093
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,020
He's dead.

1094
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,080
Oh god,

1095
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,690

1096
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,720
Holy shit, I'm so confused

1097
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,430
It's only illusion, Freya, wake up

1098
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:37,550

01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:48,240
remember it would be really helpful if you help out you know
It's true all of it, but for love of you.

1104
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:53,020
I became a better man a counselor for peace and ally to all
those who

1105
01:15:57,060 --> 01:16:04,780
Maybe they'll be really helpful if you help out, you know,
you know, at least At least Freya actually shot him for me

1106
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,880
Watch out.

1107
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:07,520
Thank you.

1108
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,880
Okay, which one?

1109
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:10,840
Be rare which one?

1110
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:16,100
Oh, no, that means I'm next Oh my god.

1111
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:16,800
Okay, that's fine.

1112
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,160
That's fine.

1113
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:17,780
That's a cutscene.

1114
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,700
I'll get my HP back.

1115
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:22,620
It is

1116
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,910
not her.

1117
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,950
No, of course.

1118
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:33,410
He can attack is in a tree.

1119
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:39,750
Oh, shit.

1120
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,290
Oh, my turn.

1121
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:45,450
It's my turn for trauma.

1122
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:45,910
Let's go.

1123
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:46,590
Oh, fuck.

1124
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:50,970
turn for trauma, guys.

1125
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:59,750
I wonder if I just have to, like, survive long enough.

1126
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,180
Nice.

1127
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,060
Alright, nice.

1128
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,220
But that's too damn bad!

1129
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,500
It's part of your prophecy!

1130
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,780
Nice.

1131
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:37,440
all he had to do was buy him an apple oh no why won't you
get me my newest apple are you fucking kidding me i fucking

1132
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,480

1133
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:52,200
oh i think i killed him too fast oh oh no it's over here oh
i to go inside the door.

1134
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:52,800
Oh, brother!

1135
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,400
Help me!

1136
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,260
He's a murderer!

1137
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:55,120
Oh!

1138
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,960
He didn't guess we the newest off-board.

1139
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,000
I think it's over.

1140
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,160
Did we pass the test?

1141
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:04,840
Did we do it?

1142
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,420
Didn't feel much like succeeding.

1143
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,720
I see the door has disappeared.

1144
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,560
Or it was never there.

1145
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,180
They toy with us still.

1146
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,040
Is this what the door led to?

1147
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,060
What is that?

1148
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,620
Yay!

1149
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:23,560
Psychological damage.

1150
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,860
She must be theirs.

1151
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,520
Will she take us to them?

1152
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:28,860
I'll ask her.

1153
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:29,700
Nice.

1154
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:30,660
Horse!

1155
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,080
Easy, girl.

1156
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:32,560
Easy.

1157
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,300
That's right.

1158
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:35,900
Good.

1159
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:38,700
Nice.

1160
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,260
Am I allowed to be on top of this horse, too?

1161
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:43,540
No.

1162
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,820
Am I worthy enough to sit on the horse?

1163
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,460
Whoa!

1164
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,000
Behind her!

1165
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,500
Oh, let's go.

1166
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,600
Wait, how do I...

1167
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,600
Oh, where's my prompt?

1168
01:18:58,740 --> 01:18:59,700
That's a good last.

1169
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,740
Oh my god.

1170
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,420
Temperamental by reputation.

1171
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,000
In my land, they...

1172
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,720
Yeah, those are the water horses, right?

1173
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,780
They can run on water.

1174
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,920
Of course, no Kelpie I know would do such a thing.

1175
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,860
Unless it was disrespected.

1176
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,020
It walks on water.

1177
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,960
Yeah, that's what Kelpies are.

1178
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,880
No mystical water steeds to speak of in Greece, brother.

1179
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,680
There were the hippocamps.

1180
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,660
They served the seaguard.

1181
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,980
I battled one upon a titan.

1182
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,320
Oh, yeah, the one that drowns people, yeah.

1183
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:31,120
Yeah,

1184
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,670
I know these horses from Frozen 2.

1185
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:46,110
They're like little mermaid horses.

1186
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:48,390
Oh, that's cool.

1187
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:51,190
I love the little seaweed design for the tail.

1188
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:53,270
Yeah.

1189
01:19:54,090 --> 01:20:02,350
You know, that scene in Frozen 2 where Elsa rode a water
horse and then like and it took her to like the heart of the

1190
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:12,510
forest or whatever the fuck yeah i watched frozen too on the
plane not in the theater still i didn't give disney money

1191
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,770
technically i watched it on the

1192
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:37,810
plane like good kratos freya and mamir's head enter the home
of the normans tentatively Oh.

1193
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,990
They have finally reached their destination.

1194
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,230
I did it.

1195
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,390
Isn't there supposed to be like three fakes?

1196
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:50,690
I seek my son.

1197
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,190
You know the child is an Asgard.

1198
01:20:57,950 --> 01:20:59,670
No, you seek.

1199
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:02,850
What all who search for us seek.

1200
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:15,590
the ending to your story oh i guess they're safe odin didn't
get to them the ghost of sparta furrows his brow menacingly

1201
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:30,370
he resists the urge to grunt oh he fails god that is so
annoying like i seeking freedom from your scripts as if

1202
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:40,570
knowing your lines would grant you the power god they're so
annoying they're so annoying the sisters of rage fading yeah

1203
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:54,600
but you caught him the destroyer of fate there must be a way
to survive destiny is she making fun of us destiny park the

1204
01:21:54,600 --> 01:22:05,380
protagonists are speechless they do not understand there is
no grand design no script only the choices you make let your

1205
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:17,060
choice are so predictable merely make us seem prescient when
my son was born shut up holy this is why they have no

1206
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:26,640
friends and have to be isolated from society a needless
death and he did because you could not let him go because he

1207
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:36,060
thirst this is why society doesn't want anything to do with
you you kill gods you're annoying but what kratos did was

1208
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:46,940
not out of hate oh should i bring him a crown then he still
slays gods but now he's sad about it you are the sum of your

1209
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:54,000
choices nothing more and because your choices never change
you will learn that heimdall intends to kill your son and

1210
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:03,000
asgard what you will do what you do best well i didn't know
that the skies burn the curtains fall

1211
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:16,900
again he misses the point yeah i'm like i you knew ham does
gonna kill him he's like i knew ham does gonna kill we are

1212
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,880
leaving he

1213
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:35,000
stomps away followed closely by freya i enjoyed your story
kratos pity it has to end so soon

1214
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:53,880
So we came all the way here Just for them to be like I told
you so So we can't even do anything Really came all the way

1215
01:23:53,880 --> 01:24:01,980
here And then they're like We're like we told I told you so
There's nothing you can do You can't change the past Can't

1216
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:13,040
change the future Oh I learned about Hamdell I did I did I
like how the The fates were like Um, then you find out, then

1217
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,700
you learn that Hamda's about to kill your son.

1218
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:20,000
And then I'm like, and then Kratos like, Hamda's about to
kill who now?

1219
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,660
He's like, oh, wait, you didn't know that.

1220
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,660
Well, guess you know now.

1221
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:30,380
Yeah, technically they did give me, they did give me one
answer.

1222
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:45,290
That's better.

1223
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,730
I can feel things getting more normal.

1224
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,070
He's like, oops, spoilers.

1225
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:50,550
Wait.

1226
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:52,650
That tree.

1227
01:24:53,090 --> 01:25:02,890
well isn't that interesting what is this yeah that's the
noose brother the one odin hanged himself with as part of

1228
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:10,790
his endless mad quest for secrets of life and death and what
have you what are you doing it's a charged object

1229
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:18,450
significant to odin perhaps i'll find a use for it that's
crazy the face where like he's gonna die and needless death

1230
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:24,510
and then later on it's like um oh yeah sorry I forgot to
tell you because we told you that you're the one that caused

1231
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:30,690
your son's death like that's fucked up Of course we bloody
won't the question is how that's fucked up.

1232
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:36,950
They're like oops, sorry I guess I meant you were the one
that caused your son's death because you got super paranoid

1233
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:41,930
after we told you that your son was going to die You know
Heimdall.

1234
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:44,050
I grant you that he's a spiteful vicious.

1235
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:51,850
I'm so loyal Odin entrusted him with Gala horn If we have
the chance to eliminate him before Ragnarok rock we

1236
01:25:51,850 --> 01:26:03,990
shouldn't hesitate considering his powers of foresight alone
that is an if of mountainous size all right we'll go this

1237
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:15,730
way we never oh wait we did nevermind I thought I was
thinking about like it was her puzzle I forgot it was a

1238
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:27,250
self-fulfilling prophecy I think it was a bitchy move for
them to tell her about the the prophecy this

1239
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:50,550
is why society isolate that's why they don't have friends
your only friend is each other she did ask yeah and they had

1240
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:59,010
a choice to not say anything even supposing we're all
perfectly comfortable plotting an assassination and I for

1241
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:05,950
one am a might rusty at that measure yeah we've got no way
to reach hindal and no way to kill him if we did i have

1242
01:27:05,950 --> 01:27:14,790
killed god greater than him that's true i don't doubt that
brother but it's hardly my point but it wouldn't be funny

1243
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:18,450
that is also true how do i get that

1244
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,470
but he can't just do this to me

1245
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:33,670
they're like oh it's gonna be scat sisters it's gonna be so
funny She doesn't know.

1246
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,570
We're about to tell her that her son's about to die.

1247
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:41,410
And oh my god, it's gonna be so fucking funny when she
doesn't even know that it's because of her.

1248
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:47,810
Ha ha, wait until she finds out that she was the one that
causes his own son's death.

1249
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:50,110
Kratos, I see something.

1250
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:53,830
What do you see?

1251
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:56,630
Oh.

1252
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:59,370
Oh, shit, nice.

1253
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,120
Fuck.

1254
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,400
Have I been here?

1255
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,280
I'm just like...

1256
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,350
I mean, there's...

1257
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:15,330
Yeah, but then there might be...

1258
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:16,860
Oh, shit.

1259
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,920
Wait, have I...

1260
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,520
Oh, I've been here.

1261
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,060
Oopsie.

1262
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,240
Yeah, the ultimate prank.

1263
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,120
It's this way.

1264
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,120
Sorry, all the rocks blurred together.

1265
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:39,000
better for me.

1266
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,100
I think we're missing the no one's message here.

1267
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:47,400
We've all got our tendencies and yours is to run headlong
into danger to protect the ones you love.

1268
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,140
I do not intend to change.

1269
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,900
Not about that.

1270
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,200
Why should you?

1271
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,820
Apparently my tendency is to kill the ones I love.

1272
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,300
Yeah, like get punked.

1273
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,500
I don't need you to come.

1274
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,120
Oh, fuck this girl in particular.

1275
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,920
Four out of 48.

1276
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,380
It's gonna be a while.

1277
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:08,920
No.

1278
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:11,920
But Baldur's fate had many causes.

1279
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:13,820
Prophecy among them.

1280
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,140
How do you mean, brother?

1281
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:21,240
There are many tales in my homeland of those who fulfilled
prophecy by attempting to avoid it.

1282
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:28,340
So it was when Freya tried to protect Baldur, and so it was
when I accused my son of going to Asgard.

1283
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:29,720
Then we agree.

1284
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,000
It'd be foolish to go after Heimdall.

1285
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:32,560
No.

1286
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:38,120
If Heimdall must die for Atreus to live, then Heimdall must
die.

1287
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:47,780
how can you say that knowing what you know because if
hindall is a threat to my son i must act it is your nature

1288
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:59,280
well played i mean he is right because he has his son is his
future so like he's already lived through so much you know

1289
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:11,100
he's already lived through so much pain and grief he must
he's like i want my son to go through the same thing like he

1290
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:20,100
knows he's gonna die by killing Heimdell but like as long as
his son gets to live on his future live on his life and his

1291
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:30,520
legacy that's all that matters to him yeah i can't really
blame a dad for that return home consider our plans because

1292
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,440
like he doesn't want to lose his son like he lost his
daughter wait is he still where yeah he i mean technically

1293
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:42,740
he's still wearing his like the red paint right i'm sure
there was some loose end we meant to circle back to give

1294
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:49,860
your mind a little time to process everything he just
doesn't want to go through that again at the late i'm

1295
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:57,500
certainly happy to spend time somewhere other than your god
it's your choice brother or is it the ashes i can't tell if

1296
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:08,260
it's the red or the or the white the white paint yeah like
does he still have that on i can't tell if it's to snow or

1297
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:20,260
like his skin uh i can't tell if he still has it on it's
snowing right now like the real reason kratos wants to kill

1298
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:29,120
hymed up is because the game needs another boss fight but
now i think of the super chat thank you thank you all right

1299
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,860
let's see if we oh armor do i need a stronger armor

1300
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,300
Should we free the nipple?

1301
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,740
Always free the nipple, guys.

1302
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,580
That's where his power level is.

1303
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,830
We can't restrict his power level.

1304
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:52,770
Wait, can I level up any of this yet?

1305
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:55,270
I disable it.

1306
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,950
Why the fuck would I disable it?

1307
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:00,690
Hold triangle while sprinting to activate.

1308
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,210
Oh, wait, I like that.

1309
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:06,590
Like, L1, R2 to quickly recall and perform a power weapon as
well.

1310
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:08,770
I might as well upgrade all this.

1311
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,310
And so I have enough XP.

1312
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,120
Alright, just two more left.

1313
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,300
Okay, I'll upgrade the blades.

1314
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,380
I didn't check.

1315
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,860
Norns have any good news for you?

1316
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:28,540
No.

1317
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:29,420
Ah.

1318
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,620
Maybe buying something expensive to take your mind off it?

1319
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,220
Always a joy to work on these.

1320
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,880
Yay, retail therapy.

1321
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,480
Yippee.

1322
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,180
We love retail therapy.

1323
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,560
Griffin, thank you for the raid.

1324
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,400
Thank you, thank you.

Thank you.

I hope you had a great stream.

1327
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,720
Okay, can I upgrade anything else?

1328
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:52,360
Nah.

1329
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:55,340
What's the sword?

1330
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,560
And for the Valkyrie Queen?

1331
01:32:57,980 --> 01:32:58,320
Nothing.

1332
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,440
What about the nothing?

1333
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,240
This increases the damage cost by extinguishing... Oh!

1334
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:13,980
Hmm...

1335
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:24,060

1338
01:33:53,390 --> 01:34:11,070

decrease the luck by a lot whatever okay I'll craft this

1339
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:16,250
it's higher which means it's better right that's how it goes

1340
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,240

runes I need to equip.

1344
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:01,770
Was it a relic?

1345
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:03,010
No.

1346
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,190
It was...

1347
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:07,910
Wait, do I have a heavy attack?

1348
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,450
No, I don't.

1349
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:08,950
Not yet.

1350
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:11,130
Nah.

1351
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:13,150
What was it?

1352
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,070
There was like...

1353
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:14,950
Oh, no.

1354
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:15,870
Oh, wait, that's free.

1355
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:16,290
Oh, there you go.

1356
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:16,770
Amulet.

1357
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:17,370
There you go.

1358
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:20,530
Set a...

1359
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:22,210
Increase...

1360
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,670
Kratos melee damage.

1361
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:25,370
Set an increase.

1362
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:26,430
Wait, seal a...

1363
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,590
Increase the damage of all death above.

1364
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:30,850
Creases based on...

1365
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,510
Ooh, wait.

1366
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:32,390
Stun.

1367
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,380
Wait, does it have...

1368
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:39,080
Requires two?

1369
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,600
I don't have two of the three of that.

1370
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,280
Yeah, I remember...

1371
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,220
I couldn't remember if it was the red or the white.

1372
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,680
That was, like, the ash of his previous family.

1373
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,560
Mack, thank you for the super chat.

1374
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,760
Mark, thank you for the super chat.

01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,600
Thank you.

1377
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,000
I'm so excited for the remaster.

1378
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,460
I hope they keep the...

1379
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,060

birds and the bees Press circle.

01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:37,800
Press circle to thrust.

1384
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,620
Any move you make, you'll have seen it coming.

1385
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,600
If you must face him, we need something else.

1386
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:44,600
An edge.

1387
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:45,760
You, Mamie?

1388
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:48,220
Very well.

1389
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,340
We will ask the dwarves.

1390
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,980
Ah, the inevitable asking of the dwarves.

1391
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,780
I mean, the dwarves know what's up.

1392
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:04,810
Say the push away daughter, quick time.

offspring have been let loose into the nine realms one of it

1395
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:29,030
unfortunately without a proper role model to supervise i
even know he abandons his good spoil there i didn't know

1396
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:36,090
there was a bad in your child quick at time event but
everyone knows about the bad one in order to avoid such a

1397
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:43,990
great i'd like you to bring the lean worms to me i believe i
can act as a satisfactory paternal figure in their

1398
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:50,410
upbringing you'll find the specimens gnawing on tears
throughout the realms oh okay this device to safely store

terrible babysitter what the by yourself they're goddamn

personalities compared to wrestling with my emotions in the

1401
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:11,910
most literal absences i dare say raising a handful of leaned
worms will be a walk in the park yeah but he doesn't know i

1402
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:17,390
killed his mom though but like but like that's his fault for
losing the children

had to do babysit and he couldn't even look after he can't

other one if she if her husband didn't abandon him and her

01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:46,270
So now you intend to kill my dumb.

1421
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:49,130
Violence cannot prevent violence, Kratos.

1422
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,930
I truly thought you understood that.

1423
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:53,570
God, what a fucking pussy.

1424
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,430
How is he ever a god of war?

1425
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:00,970
God, he must have got out from nepotism or some shit.

1426
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:03,110
What do you mean, like war?

1427
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:03,670
Yes!

1428
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:05,610
Yes, like war!

1429
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:19,010

01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,320

01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,420
oh i'm gonna miss you little one Is that Daphne?

1433
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:50,000
Daphne?

1434
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:50,760
Or Daphne?

1435
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:51,100
Oh!

1436
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,260
Oh, it replicates...

1437
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:56,800
Got it!

1438
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,020
Yeah, I was gonna say, it replicates...

1439
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:00,100
Rings.

1440
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:07,330
Yeah.

1441
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,030
It's the ring.

1442
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:13,590
You're all worried about your son, but we need...

1443
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:17,970
Heimdall's a threat, not only to Atreus, but to everyone.

1444
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:22,170
He's Odin's left hand, and he carries the horn that begins
Ragged Rock.

1445
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:24,930
If we have the chance to eliminate him, we should...

1446
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,770
And it's just as likely a trap because the bastard knows
your intentions.

1447
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:28,910
Never meet your idols, guys.

1448
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:31,370
Here's an example of that.

1449
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,490
...a finger on him.

1450
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:33,650
Not one.

1451
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,470
Well, I gathered what's fit for gathering.

1452
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,110
How long will it take?

1453
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:41,850
We'll have to go to Svartalfheim to get the rest of the
materials.

1454
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:45,170
Not to mention we'll have to visit...

1455
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:45,810
...the lady?

1456
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:47,510
The lady?

1457
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:48,630
Oh.

1458
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:51,330
Oh.

1459
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:53,410
That's a relief.

1460
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:58,770
Oh, he doesn't want to lick.

1461
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,030
Ha ha ha ha!

1462
01:43:01,630 --> 01:43:02,190
Kratos?

1463
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:03,990
Lick my ring.

1464
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:05,470
My precious.

1465
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:14,560
The lady?

1466
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,260
No idea what he's on about.

1467
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,000
Yeah, it's like that.

1468
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:17,960
The lady.

1469
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:25,890
I don't.

1470
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:29,390
I don't like who I became on our last adventure.

1471
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:32,030
I can't be around the violence.

1472
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:32,670
God!

1473
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:36,090
You're such a pussy, man.

1474
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,510
What happened to you, bro?

1475
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:42,990
Even now I'm retired and I'm still punching people.

1476
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:48,830
I bet you can't even crush an egg.

1477
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,930
God damn pussy.

1478
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:55,910
Why do we even have him here?

1479
01:43:57,130 --> 01:43:59,530
He's just a leech, man.

1480
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:00,870
He's just a mooch.

1481
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,990
He's literally squatting at her home.

1482
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:07,390
Might as well just throw him back in a prison.

1483
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,210
See you out there.

1484
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:11,230
He cooks.

1485
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:13,210
He's not even cooking.

1486
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:19,970
I bet he can't even stab someone.

1487
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:21,170
Just a freeloader.

1488
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:23,410
Hanging out in my home.

1489
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:24,290
Eating my food.

1490
01:44:24,450 --> 01:44:25,050
I'll take it from here.

1491
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:26,130
Oh no.

1492
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:28,750
This whole thing were my idea.

1493
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:30,850
I'll speak to the lady.

1494
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:31,790
Ooh.

1495
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:34,190
I never get to speak to the lady.

1496
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:35,830
There are reasons for that.

1497
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:37,210
Brock will go.

1498
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:38,210
No, no, no.

1499
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:39,190
I have to.

1500
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:40,230
You heard him.

1501
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:41,870
Quit your fretting.

1502
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,870
I ain't gonna mess nothing up.

1503
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:47,430
What the?

1504
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:48,870
Huh?

1505
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:52,710
No, you pimple shrimps.

1506
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:55,930
Think that'll keep us out?

1507
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,500
Well, think the fuck again.

1508
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:19,890
what was all that then oh just sundry trying to hog all the
glory same old not that the gate what's wrong yeah what's

1509
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:27,690
wrong with it most likely someone in neither valerian making
a fuckery of the works probably on account of all that

1510
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:37,770
incursion and you got up to but don't worry you little
dangling head old brock came prepared i got ways in and out

1511
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:47,970
from the old days don't look for on account of being stupid
we should just have brock we should just have brock kill

1512
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:57,590
hymda he only has three out of four souls he could never
predict him at that point did you did you turn the door on

1513
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:06,770
and off abandoned service tunnel direct to the forge bro at
this point so i can give brock the next brock and he's gone

1514
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:20,030
you sure he was the right pick for this He speaks plain and
yet so colorfully I trust him his head ain't right, but I

1515
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:20,870
trust him

1516
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:44,520
Oh, I should not have taken that Okay, I need you to do this
so I can do this There we keep cooperating maybe someday

1517
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:49,460
it'll be Asgard in flames that is not my goal Doesn't mean
it's not your destiny.

1518
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,560
What are you insinuating, Highness?

1519
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,980
Not a thing.

1520
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:55,460
Alright.

1521
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:56,740
Grab.

1522
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:00,840
Can't spell Brock without bro, so true.

1523
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:03,560
Why would he hide in here?

1524
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:07,000
He feared something in these tunnels more than he feared
starving.

1525
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:07,820
Oh, is this just bonus?

1526
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:09,060
It hardly seems rational.

1527
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,100
Fear seldom is.

1528
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:11,920
Oh, it was.

1529
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:14,520
Hey, bonus is it?

1530
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,080
Yeah, it really is.

1531
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:25,560
that was like not even like the initial place i supposed to
go so travel for liquor and explosives little on the nose

1532
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:34,020
for dwarven culture isn't it ridiculing a culture you helped
undermine classic ace here oh all right might have found

1533
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:47,720
that one okay let's just okay let's just stir that up oh
shit what the fuck okay i didn't think he was Towards me,

1534
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:48,380
not gonna lie.

1535
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,920
I thought he was looking at my tank.

1536
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:58,590
Well, I can see why it's an abandoned service tunnel.

1537
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,580
Yeah, there's some.

1538
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:04,800
Oh, which one?

1539
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:05,280
This?

1540
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,440
No, that's just a...

1541
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,420
That's just a barrel of wine.

1542
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,020
He's fine.

1543
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:16,880
Doesn't seem too bad.

1544
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,220
Wait, do I?

1545
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,120
Is that for...

1546
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,540
Is that ice or flames?

1547
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,700
Oh, I don't think anything matters.

1548
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,160
Oops, that's my bad.

1549
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,540
It's fine.

1550
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:33,980
Okay.

1551
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,640
Swing, swing, swing.

1552
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:43,180
Is that ice or flame?

1553
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:43,560
Yes.

1554
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:49,020
Alright, that's bonus.

1555
01:48:49,140 --> 01:49:09,960
loot so all right light blue is for flames okay not a hotel
oil spill oh i should do that oil equals fire yeah

1556
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:24,690
okay Nice.

1557
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:29,950
What the fuck?

1558
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:32,050
I did not use any shields for that.

1559
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:34,830
You know what?

1560
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:35,150
Fuck it.

1561
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:36,230
I'm low HP too.

1562
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:36,950
I might as well.

1563
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:37,570
Slap dunk!

1564
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:39,290
What the fuck?

1565
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:40,150
Who's this guy?

1566
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:46,790
Oh, there was a lot more people than I expected.

1567
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:47,130
Oops.

1568
01:49:47,630 --> 01:49:48,170
My bad.

1569
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:53,230
Okay, nice.

1570
01:49:53,490 --> 01:49:54,790
Okay, get out of here.

1571
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:58,110
That's right.

1572
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:01,270
Get yourself out of here.

1573
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:02,370
Get out of here!

1574
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:06,070
I thought monsters stronger than this.

1575
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,290
You're nothing to me.

1576
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:13,270
I don't even recognize you as real.

1577
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:14,570
Oh, hey.

1578
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:15,170
Well.

1579
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:16,850
What?

1580
01:50:17,690 --> 01:50:18,970
Who said that?

1581
01:50:19,890 --> 01:50:20,990
Who called my name?

1582
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:25,450
Wait, what are you doing here?

1583
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:27,450
Rock!

1584
01:50:32,930 --> 01:50:35,790
How do I do this?

1585
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:46,370
Whoops.

1586
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:53,170
Let's just blow...

1587
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:53,590
Oh.

1588
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:57,510
I think I messed up the puzzle, guys.

1589
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,360
Oh.

1590
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:04,700
Oh, that's awkward.

1591
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:07,760
Wait.

1592
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,800
I think I can fix it.

1593
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:15,420
Um.

1594
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,260
Oh, yeah, it's still doable.

1595
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:29,960
What the fuck?

1596
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:32,140
Alright, I give up.

1597
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,240
Please listen.

1598
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,620
You have to let me take Brock's place.

1599
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,100
Why?

1600
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:37,600
He can't talk to the lady.

1601
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:38,700
Why not?

1602
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:39,520
No.

1603
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,120
Do not ask again.

1604
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:43,100
Is it because he's three out of four?

1605
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,160
Wait, explain.

1606
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:50,440
I mean, he could give me more context.

1607
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:52,300
It's not too hard.

1608
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:57,980
It's not his fault, Atreus ran off, you know.

1609
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:01,340
Or are you just being Brock's champion?

1610
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:02,780
There is again.

1611
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,000
You're insinuating and you know it.

1612
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,000
Can't the smartest man alive put it together?

1613
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,780
The giants conceal a mysterious figure who changes the fate
of Ragnarok.

1614
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,760
Oh hey, what the fuck?

1615
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:19,200
The one who's fought a war against gods and won.

1616
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,220
I am not their champion.

1617
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:22,720
I didn't even notice this.

1618
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,420
We're each entitled to our opinion.

1619
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:27,620
What the fuck?

1620
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,260
Where there's a gear like that, there's usually a chain
somewhere.

1621
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,820
Yeah, I was gonna say, what is this doing here?

1622
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:39,700
The sigil arrows should work with ice as well.

1623
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,660
What's that got to do with ice?

1624
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:47,240
I don't see no ice anywhere.

1625
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:49,720
Oh, hey.

1626
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,340
Oh, extends the duration of ice.

1627
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:56,040
Oh.

1628
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:57,980
I see.

1629
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:00,800
Oh, okay.

1630
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,080
Oops, that's my bad.

1631
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:06,820
I did not realize I was standing in a puddle of oil.

1632
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:23,150
Alright.

1633
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:25,950
How does this work?

1634
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:29,470
These gates seem to be connected.

1635
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,110
See if you can break that farm switch thing.

1636
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:35,130
Ah, I see.

1637
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:37,850
Oops, sorry.

1638
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:43,490
Whoops, sorry.

1639
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:44,170
I see.

1640
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:45,030
I still see.

1641
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:49,050
Oh, give me a sec.

1642
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:49,850
That's awkward.

1643
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:51,070
But I see it.

1644
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,770
I see it, guys.

1645
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:56,330
Wait, there's something here.

1646
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,840
Yeah, seeing is a process.

1647
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:14,440
Oh, whoops.

1648
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:24,270
There you go.

1649
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:26,870
I'm so smart.

1650
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:28,450
Oh, shit!

1651
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,740
That's fine.

1652
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:41,020
Alright.

1653
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,460
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1654
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:49,540
What the fuck?

1655
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,200
Okay, nice dodge.

1656
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:55,760
Good job, Jokey.

1657
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:56,760
Good dodge.

1658
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,440
Okay, come on.

1659
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:59,800
I dodged that.

1660
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,100
Okay, nice.

1661
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,960
Yeah, this guy needs to brush his teeth.

1662
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:13,740
At least get...

1663
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:14,220
Or at least get...

1664
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,000
Get like a fucking air freshener.

1665
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:19,180
Yeah, bear refment.

1666
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,600
Alright, where do I go?

1667
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,280
I need to get one of those gates open.

1668
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:29,280
Think, Doki.

1669
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:29,940
Think.

1670
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,580
A puzzle to another puzzle?

1671
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:34,920
That's fucked up.

1672
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,140
There should be like a five-minute cooldown.

1673
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:45,100
Ah, we've seen these troughs before, haven't we, brother?

1674
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,280
Oh, we have!

1675
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:53,540
Okay.

1676
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:57,280
Now where'd it go?

1677
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:04,150
Wait, where'd it go?

1678
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:09,070
Oh!

1679
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:10,570
That worked.

1680
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:11,990
Shall we?

1681
01:56:12,910 --> 01:56:15,210
Wait, but how do I get here?

1682
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,640
Wait, how would it go here?

1683
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:28,620
Yeah?

1684
01:56:39,310 --> 01:56:41,090
Why water no go here?

1685
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:45,790
Water.

1686
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:48,410
Why you no go over there?

1687
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:53,990
How do I get water to go there?

1688
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:59,690
But there's so much loot here.

1689
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:02,010
Oh, first go there?

1690
01:57:02,210 --> 01:57:02,610
Okay.

1691
01:57:03,610 --> 01:57:05,910
Okay, first goes there.

1692
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:13,700
This opinion of yours, was that the reason you proposed this
alliance?

1693
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:17,020
You expect me to lead your armies at Ragnarok.

1694
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:18,980
That is Tears' job.

1695
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:20,180
Not mine.

1696
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,980
It's plain to see Tears know war god anymore.

1697
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,140
Nor am I.

1698
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:26,100
I have left that life behind.

1699
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:28,520
Yeah, I've left that life behind, but look at me.

1700
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,840
I'm still fucking badass as hell.

1701
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:31,960
Forging this weapon?

1702
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,180
Your choice.

1703
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:40,920
You know where it might lead I am only protecting I know I
know and we both know the place is protecting your child

1704
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:59,180
Can't use that excuse now I might I've retired but look at
me I'm still just as badass as I was before Outside of

1705
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:01,580
retirement I get that

1706
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,460
What the fuck?

1707
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:17,330
Okay.

1708
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:19,910
Cigil arrows won't work on this.

1709
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:25,030
Then how do I do this?

1710
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:39,390
Did it touch?

1711
01:58:40,850 --> 01:58:42,870
Cigil arrows won't work on this.

1712
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:44,410
How touch?

1713
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:50,060
Is it touching?

1714
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:12,820
oh my god come on guys why no touch i'm trying to angle this

1715
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,680
maybe a touch

1716
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:35,060
Are you fucking kidding me?

1717
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:36,320
How is that?

1718
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,200
Oh my god.

1719
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:44,900
Yay!

1720
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:48,940
Simple geometry.

1721
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:49,940
That's right.

1722
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,360
What do you mean, VOD watches?

1723
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:53,720
That's right.

1724
01:59:57,480 --> 01:59:59,380
Non-believers, Star-Aze.

1725
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:02,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1726
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:03,040
Thank you.

1727
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,580
I can't believe it.

1728
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:09,200
That's right.

1729
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,400
What the fuck?

1730
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,780
The scrimmer possessed by nightmares.

1731
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:22,120
They'll be even more dangerous until we stun them.

1732
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:23,640
Why do we stun?

1733
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,260
Wait, what the fuck?

1734
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:29,220
Oh, shit.

1735
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:30,360
Wait, he's re-genning.

1736
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:31,360
Wait, that's illegal.

1737
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:33,760
Man.

1738
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:37,320
Okay, nice.

1739
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:37,940
I took him out.

1740
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:41,820
I'm gonna say I was one stunned him.

1741
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:45,220
I just beat the shit out of him until he's stunned question
mark

1742
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:51,970
Just keep hitting him All

1743
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:03,280
right, nice more HP There anything I have to do here

1744
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:09,970
I'm about to go back here one day

1745
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:25,280
Oh Above you watch out All right, it's fine.

1746
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:28,600
He's gonna kill him first.

1747
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,500
My god, Freya, your fist is not gonna do anything.

1748
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:38,000
Like Freya, just use your magic!

1749
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:43,440
You see this?

1750
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:44,960
Okay, nice.

1751
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:49,960
All right, last one.

1752
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,120
What the fuck did I do?

1753
02:01:59,100 --> 02:01:59,560
All right, nice.

1754
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:00,740
More heals.

1755
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,800
Give me your loot.

1756
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:05,340
Atreus' mother was a giant.

1757
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:06,280
Isn't that right?

1758
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:07,800
She was one of the Yodnar.

1759
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:10,140
She was a giant woman.

1760
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:12,200
Wow, what a woman she was.

1761
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:14,320
I know not all giants are giants.

1762
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,220
No, there's anything wrong with the disparity in size.

1763
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,460
There's nothing wrong dating a giant woman.

1764
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:27,080
Freya does not judge.

1765
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,740
He's like, I will not judge.

1766
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:36,060
That's what you're into.

1767
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:40,340
Freya's just self-conscious because she's like, man.

1768
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:43,300
Would he...

1769
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:46,700
I don't know if I can live up to your ex.

1770
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:51,060
I wasn't 20 feet tall like her.

1771
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:52,560
Okay.

1772
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,540
And she's right.

1773
02:02:58,880 --> 02:02:59,140
What do you mean?

1774
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:01,300
You know what they say about multiple limbs.

1775
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:04,300
Oh, there you go.

1776
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:05,600
There.

1777
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:07,460
Now we can open the other gate.

1778
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:08,040
Yay!

1779
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:10,840
Why is it you ask?

1780
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:15,220
I was just thinking of how Odin antagonized the giants for
generations.

1781
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,880
Nearly wiped them out of existence twice.

1782
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:19,240
What do they say?

1783
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:21,900
Now you may have a role to play in stopping him once in a
while.

1784
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:23,020
You gotta watch The Little Mermaid.

1785
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:32,360
do not presume to know not that little mermaid i'm not
saying anything you haven't thought her secrets haunt every

1786
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:39,040
step of your path wasn't it maybe if you talked about your
doubts they wouldn't explode when you talk to your son i do

1787
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:48,180
not doubt she knows what i left behind she would never have
asked out of me why would she need to ask she saw your fate

1788
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:55,320
three of odin's kin dead because of the path she put you on
you don't think she knew exactly what it meant Sending you

1789
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:55,940
to Jotunheim?

1790
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:59,840
This is mere conjecture, and probably quite enough of it,
Highness.

1791
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:04,560
We're all making an effort to cooperate here, after all.

1792
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:07,280
Oh.

1793
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:10,280
It's not for me to say.

1794
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:13,160
All right.

1795
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,020
Let's get that wheel turning.

1796
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:16,620
Yeah.

1797
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:20,460
I think it was the wrong time of her giving me...

1798
02:04:20,460 --> 02:04:21,420
Guys, what did she say?

1799
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:24,100
I was using my entire...

1800
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:26,960
all three brain cells trying to figure out how to do that.

1801
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:33,360
It was actually, guys, I actually did not pay attention on
whatever the fuck the lore drop was.

1802
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:36,340
I was trying to figure out the puzzle.

1803
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:40,760
Guys, can anyone give me a quick spark note?

1804
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:43,700
Let's try and figure out the puzzle, guys.

1805
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,640
Holy shit, he has so much HP.

1806
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:51,960
Freya, any moment now.

1807
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:53,600
Oh my god.

1808
02:04:58,300 --> 02:04:59,260
Behind you!

1809
02:04:59,420 --> 02:04:59,920
He's coming!

1810
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:00,560
That.

1811
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:05,040
Nice.

1812
02:05:09,430 --> 02:05:10,070
She said dead.

1813
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:12,290
There's no way my wife would not plan all of this.

1814
02:05:12,650 --> 02:05:13,310
She loves me!

1815
02:05:15,910 --> 02:05:16,430
Oh,

1816
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:21,390
fucking hell.

1817
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:24,750
Alright.

1818
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:27,190
Shit, they're so tanky.

1819
02:05:27,390 --> 02:05:28,990
These guys are tanky as hell.

1820
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:34,810
There's no way she would do that.

1821
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:37,350
Well, who's ready for some fresh air after that?

1822
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:38,230
Everyone.

1823
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:39,370
Thought so.

1824
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:40,750
It is close.

1825
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:41,950
I can feel it.

1826
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:44,250
She let me get a home run.

1827
02:05:44,390 --> 02:05:45,230
There's no way.

1828
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:47,430
None of that meant anything to her.

1829
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:50,890
Wait, what the fuck is that?

1830
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:52,110
I'm going to touch it.

1831
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,750
Oh.

1832
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:54,250
Oh.

1833
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:56,570
Nice.

1834
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:59,270
Always touch mysterious holes.

1835
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:02,550
You might get something nice out of it.

1836
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,280
There's no way.

1837
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:15,420
There's no way she banged me because of ulterior motives.

1838
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,440
She said she liked my eyes.

1839
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:20,240
Banana, thank you for the super chat.

1840
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:21,260
Thank you, thank you.

1841
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:26,500
Rao really wanted to create a spider side and use his dead
wife's last wish to say it was destiny for them to be

1842
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:27,620
together in war.

1843
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,580
Thank you for the super chat, banana.

1844
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:30,720
Thank you, thank you.

1845
02:06:35,050 --> 02:06:37,150
We have a son together!

1846
02:06:37,970 --> 02:06:39,730
Does that not mean anything to her?

1847
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:43,730
It just seems to me your thoughts...

1848
02:06:43,730 --> 02:06:46,070
Oh my gosh, she's fucking trying to gaslight me right now.

1849
02:06:46,890 --> 02:06:47,750
She's jealous.

1850
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:51,910
She's nagging me.

1851
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:55,310
And try to make me depend on her.

1852
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:03,570
Both can be true.

1853
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,510
When we get out of here, I'll give you some space.

1854
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:11,910
Let you think carefully about whether you're ready for what
it means to make this weapon and to use it

1855
02:07:16,310 --> 02:07:17,550
all right this way

1856
02:07:22,340 --> 02:07:34,320
and it's working meanwhile i'll see what else i can learn
while we're here i'm very lonely for you oh hey there there

1857
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:42,980
he is hey you made this bra i got everything all set here
Now we just gotta push on up to the forge.

1858
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:46,400
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

1859
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,080
Wait, why did she go this way?

1860
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:51,160
Wait, why is she going this way?

1861
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:54,820
She just flew away.

1862
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:58,760
She's not gonna join us, Brock?

1863
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:02,000
Why did she fly away?

1864
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:07,100
I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but could we just
come back to this one?

1865
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:08,440
Oh, trust me.

1866
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:20,460
why did she she just said why doki i wasn't listening to her
you know you know when when you disassociate a little bit

1867
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:22,440
when they talk a little too long

1868
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:35,460
she was literally she was literally trying to gaslight me
about my wife my dead wife might i add so like can you

1869
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:46,240
really blame me for disassociating after she tried to say my
never loved me like she literally implied my dead wife never

1870
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:54,750
loved me sorry my second dead wife

1871
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:08,950
she never said that it was in her heart that's how i felt
when she said that my second dead wife used me and i was

1872
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:15,030
like no no She implied it.

1873
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:26,250
Wait, I've been here before.

1874
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:31,710
Wait,

1875
02:09:34,830 --> 02:09:36,230
is she giving me space?

1876
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:40,210
Because I refuse to listen to her and give her a new son?

1877
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:53,080
Better take out that nest Oh, I got it.

1878
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,840
Damn, that's fucked.

1879
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:03,420
That's fucked.

1880
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:06,300
I wish he'd do that.

1881
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:07,420
These mutts?

1882
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,240
No wonder they should.

1883
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:13,300
You don't die when it came.

1884
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:15,560
Bro, Brock, what the fuck?

1885
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,780
I was so far away.

1886
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:17,240
It's okay.

1887
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:18,600
Brock, the tank is here.

1888
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:23,480
Yeah!

1889
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,540
That's fucking right.

1890
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:32,580
I've been here before Because some of the chests are open

1891
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:50,520
Some of the stuff around here has been open And I'm like

Wait, there are other dwarves.

With your protective gear.

1903
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:26,420
And you've never seen a legend in the flesh before?

1904
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:27,620
Wait, there are dwarves.

1905

you?

1907
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:46,640
Those creepy flying eyeballs made a nest up on the cable.

1908
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:50,780
We gotta figure a way out there and clear them all It's bad.

1909
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,240
I'll just keep hitting it.

There you go Destroyed a nightmare haunt to release the
lift.

1917
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:11,260
Oh, yeah.

1918
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:14,480
Yeah, because they thought he was dead.

1919
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,760
Also because he's blue.

1920
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:17,600
I almost forgot.

1921
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,700
It's also because he's blue.

1922
02:13:19,940 --> 02:13:22,380
They're like, why the fuck is this dwarf blue?

1923
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:24,680
Which is understandable.

1924
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:27,580
I mean, why is he blue?

1925
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:38,210

There you go.

All right, I found the angle.

1938
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:21,760
There we go.

1939
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,720

02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:31,360
Yay!

1943
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:35,900
Replaced on both blades in the ground to spark, mash, or
more.

1944
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,480
I have enough for...

1945
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:40,560
Oh, that's a heavy attack.

1946
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:40,980
Nice.

1947
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:43,580
I only got the heavy attack for this, too.

1948
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:45,720
I actually needed that.

1949
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:47,340
I actually...

1950
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:49,360
Let's see if we have any skills to upgrade.

1951
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:52,000
All right, we unlocked everything.

1952
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:56,540
Did I already upgrade all the level fours?

1953
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,560
I guess I did.

1954
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:02,010
Okay.

1955
02:16:02,110 --> 02:16:18,210
I think they see us who's there oh how's that who's there oh
fuck I didn't mean to do that I mean I think it looks pretty

1956
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:24,590

1957
02:16:29,150 --> 02:16:34,130
okay that's not what I want to hit because they just die
automatically Yeah.

1958
02:16:34,130 --> 02:16:36,050
Now we can ride on up to the forge.

1959
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:37,270
Come on.

1960
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:38,450
The lady's waiting.

1961
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:41,510
Hey, got another riddle for you.

1962
02:16:42,290 --> 02:16:42,570
Yeah?

1963
02:16:42,970 --> 02:16:45,970
What gets bigger, the more you take away from it.

1964
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:47,190
Well, let's see.

1965
02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:49,390
Something abstract, I expect.

1966
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:50,730
Appetite?

1967
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:52,450
No, that doesn't work.

1968
02:16:54,690 --> 02:16:56,110
Well, what is it?

1969
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:58,150
Oh, isn't that clever?

1970
02:16:59,350 --> 02:16:59,990
Bomb point.

1971
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:03,150
What gets bigger, the more...

1972
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:03,490
Oh!

1973
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:08,150

See?

1978
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:38,510
Dwarven magic's all about the intangible.

1979
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:40,570
Oh, I guess we're making the weapons.

1980
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:41,790
He adds magic in there.

1981
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:44,990
Stop what you can touch and what you can't.

1982
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:47,310
It's about understanding.

1983
02:17:47,770 --> 02:17:49,250
Understanding what?

1984
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:55,670
The nature of the things more important than the form of
the...

1985
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:57,270
Oh my god, he grabbed the wind.

1986
02:17:58,950 --> 02:17:59,710
That's crazy.

1987
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:04,820
That's fucking crazy.

1988
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:05,500

1991
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:39,900
No shield to protect you now.

1992
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,260
Bam!

1993
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:52,480
So this lady then, the lady of the forge, oh, magical
creature.

1994
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:53,960
Yeah, it's a crush.

1995
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:59,500
Why, I've been waiting for my chance to meet her since I was
knee-high to Anoka.

1996
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:02,220
But Sindri had never had it.

1997
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:04,440

I know this, though.

2011
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:48,790
If we're real lucky, she'll give us her blessing.

2012
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:55,350
Doesn't give them to every piece, but the one she does,
there's something to behold.

2013
02:20:56,030 --> 02:20:56,450
The axe?

2014
02:20:57,070 --> 02:21:01,050

all right here's the shiny rock Black.

2020
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:08,380
Faye's the only one who ever got my highbrow sense of humor.

2021
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:11,100
Damn fine woman she was.

2022
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:12,900
Apart from her taste.

2023
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:14,300
It's blue, just like him.

2024
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:15,560
Maybe he's colorblind.

2025
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:21,620
Now I need a chunk of that bronze material over by all that
busted up wood.

2026
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:22,720
Oh, is this?

2027
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:23,820
That's bronze.

2028
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:24,280
Eh.

2029
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:30,600
In those days, I get so caught up in trying to be the best
that I worked till I swum dropped.

2030
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:34,320
Chop, chop, chop, chop.

2031
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:36,740
You learn to keep your own pace.

2032
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:40,120
Save your extra effort for when it's personal.

2033
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:44,740
Like for when you finally get to show the lady who you are.

2034
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:47,580
All right, here it is.

2035
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:50,320
You sure didn't give up on that riddle in a hurry?

2036
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:51,280
I give up nothing.

2037
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:54,060
It gets bigger the more you take away, is it?

2038
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,100
That's right.

2039
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:57,920
Sorted, it's desire.

2040
02:22:58,420 --> 02:22:58,720
Nope.

2041
02:22:59,040 --> 02:22:59,780
What do you mean?

2042
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,320
Oh my God, we're smarter than Mimir.

2043
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:05,100
Memeer, Memeer.

2044
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:06,500
Alright, it's not perfect.

2045
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:07,760
But why is here your answer?

2046
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:10,320
You won't get it out of me that easy.

2047
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:14,440
Are you even a nerd, Memeer?

2048
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,160
Memeer, you can't answer this very easy riddle that even I
saw.

2049
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:22,360
One more crank to turn and it's onto the forge.

2050
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:23,640
Like really?

2051
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:30,120
You don't see the form of a forge, but we're going to the
nature of one.

2052
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,360
The nature.

2053
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:33,180
following him for the moment there

2054
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:44,020
yeah that i solved the riddle all by myself without any help
because i'm that smart that's me

2055
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:56,740
it's underwater where is the forge

2056
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:25,640

2057
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:58,640

2058
02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:10,110
shit what the fuck happened She just zapped it.

2059
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:13,330
Smithing 101.

2060
02:25:14,470 --> 02:25:16,630
This is master forgery.

2061
02:25:17,690 --> 02:25:21,310
The blood of a god?

2062
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:28,690
Holy shit.

2063
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:30,810
She maxed out her forgery skills.

2064
02:25:31,790 --> 02:25:32,790
It's fucking insane.

2065
02:25:35,510 --> 02:25:37,750
She didn't even have to hammer it like the dwarves.

2066
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:40,150
That's like...

2067
02:25:40,150 --> 02:25:42,510
That's like level one smithery.

2068
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:53,610
That's the worst side.

2069
02:25:58,190 --> 02:25:59,370
Try Mountain?

2070
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:14,020
And like, so what do I have to give in exchange?

2071
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:18,140
I feel like there's no, there's always a catch.

2072
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,160
There's no way she's giving this to me for free, right?

2073
02:26:34,310 --> 02:26:36,110
Oh, is that a new weapon?

2074
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:38,230
Oh.

2075
02:26:39,350 --> 02:26:40,510
For free?

2076
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:43,530
Just do it for the love of the game.

2077
02:26:44,370 --> 02:26:47,310
Oh my god.

2078
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:51,210
That's sick as hell.

2079
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:54,870
That's Ashley fucking sick as hell.

2080
02:26:55,410 --> 02:26:57,750
It would be an honor if you might.

2081
02:26:59,550 --> 02:27:02,170
For the love of the game.

2082
02:27:03,250 --> 02:27:04,130
Are you...

2083
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:06,270
Hello?

2084
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:08,570
Bye bye.

2085
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:22,490
my job is done now she acts like i weren't even here
manmaids don't speak to our corporeal bodies i speak to a

2086
02:27:22,490 --> 02:27:33,830
part of our soul a part specifically you might be missing oh
so she doesn't recognize him as a person she doesn't she's

2087
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:35,770
like you have no rights to speak to me

2088
02:27:40,390 --> 02:27:41,350
Fucked up!

2089
02:27:41,890 --> 02:27:43,910
Bro, why would you tell him that?

2090
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:48,990
Why would you tell him that?

2091
02:27:49,210 --> 02:27:51,670
He didn't have to let him stay ignorant!

2092
02:27:52,110 --> 02:27:55,330
Yeah, well, the one to give us the blessing just fucked off
into the tomb.

2093
02:27:55,430 --> 02:27:58,170
Why didn't... Okay, why did Kratos not ask for a blessing?

2094
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:01,730
It needs the blessing of a great blacksmith.

2095
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:03,890
That's why she doesn't, he doesn't recognize him.

2096
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:06,290
Yeah, I know he doesn't see it.

2097
02:28:06,310 --> 02:28:07,190
She doesn't see him.

2098
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:08,350
But all that's...

2099
02:28:09,350 --> 02:28:20,110

Ha!

2121
02:31:25,870 --> 02:31:26,150

2124
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:33,050

Yep.

2129
02:32:10,030 --> 02:32:12,390
Guess we're doing this one, boy style.

2130
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:18,660
Okay, Bragg.

2131
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:20,860
I mean, he was a Spartan.

2132
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:29,680
He was, I think, I think Kratos was, don't worry, Kratos is
very well versed in boy style as a fellow Spartan.

2133
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:32,580
Maxim, uh, Maxi, thank you, this is for chat.

Thank you.

2136
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:40,700
is if it's the first weapon in the series that's
specifically made for Kratos and I'll thrust it on him.

2137
02:32:40,700 --> 02:32:41,360
Look at the Super Chat.

But we got a little excited after he blessed the weapon.

2142
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:50,900
That's why he didn't teleport.

2143
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:57,420
A little bit of Greek wrestling.

2144
02:32:57,820 --> 02:32:58,140
You know?

2145
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:00,480

02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:01,060
He's Greek.

02:33:03,440 --> 02:33:03,700

Agreed.

02:40:35,850 --> 02:40:42,510
All right, maybe I can't beat him up over him.

2223
02:40:43,070 --> 02:40:43,610
No, I can't.

2224
02:40:43,630 --> 02:40:44,210
I was going to say.

2225
02:40:46,570 --> 02:40:48,110
No, not him.

2226
02:40:49,790 --> 02:40:51,570
Behind you, big guy.

2227
02:40:54,010 --> 02:40:55,070
Wait, there's two?

2228
02:40:56,650 --> 02:40:57,830
Oh, this is bad.

2229
02:40:57,950 --> 02:40:58,390
Okay, wait.

2230
02:40:59,690 --> 02:41:00,610
Oh, shit.

2231
02:41:00,930 --> 02:41:02,010
Wait, it's not fair.

2232
02:41:04,810 --> 02:41:05,830
Oh, fuck.

2233
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:07,650
Okay, I need to grab the heels here.

2234
02:41:07,930 --> 02:41:08,570
That's all right, Brock.

2235
02:41:08,790 --> 02:41:09,510
You do your thing.

2236
02:41:10,450 --> 02:41:11,850
I'm just going to grab heels real quick.

2237
02:41:14,530 --> 02:41:15,170
Oh, my God.

2238
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:16,190
I got to grab heels real quick.

2239
02:41:16,490 --> 02:41:17,210
Oh, my God.

2240
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:19,230
Yeah.

2241
02:41:20,350 --> 02:41:21,230
Fight that.

2242
02:41:22,370 --> 02:41:25,150
I didn't think I was going to have 20 other.

2243
02:41:25,390 --> 02:41:27,570
I thought it was just one guy.

2244
02:41:31,230 --> 02:41:31,250
Okay.

2245
02:41:31,550 --> 02:41:34,490
To be fair, I thought it was one guy.

2246
02:41:37,310 --> 02:41:42,250
I didn't think there were like 20 enemies that had to worry
about.

2247
02:41:46,870 --> 02:41:48,260
I'll see you back here.

2248
02:41:52,250 --> 02:41:53,210
There you go.

2249
02:41:55,940 --> 02:41:55,960
Fuck!

2250
02:41:56,280 --> 02:41:58,080
Why are you guys appearing to out?

2251
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:00,620
Oh, this is bad.

2252
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:01,400
They're getting closer.

2253
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:03,900
All right, here you go.

2254
02:42:07,290 --> 02:42:08,130
That's fine.

2255
02:42:11,050 --> 02:42:13,810
Sorry, maybe I can beat him off cliff.

2256
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:18,030
Okay, that's fine.

2257
02:42:19,330 --> 02:42:20,170
I can use this.

2258
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:22,870
And I can use this.

2259
02:42:23,870 --> 02:42:25,070
And I'm on top of him!

2260
02:42:26,510 --> 02:42:27,910
And it's troll fight!

2261
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:29,790
Troll fight!

2262
02:42:30,430 --> 02:42:31,270
Troll fight!

2263
02:42:32,330 --> 02:42:35,830
And I can jump over to the other guy too after I kill him.

2264
02:42:38,110 --> 02:42:39,310
All right, all right, all right, it's fine, it's fine.

2265
02:42:39,450 --> 02:42:40,090
Still sun?

2266
02:42:40,670 --> 02:42:41,170
There we go.

2267
02:42:41,310 --> 02:42:41,810
Oh, fuck.

2268
02:42:41,930 --> 02:42:43,070
Okay, that's not what I wanted.

2269
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:43,870
But that's okay.

2270
02:42:44,810 --> 02:42:45,610
That's okay.

2271
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:48,430
And then...

2272
02:42:48,970 --> 02:42:50,070
There we go.

2273
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:56,190
And then...

2274
02:42:56,190 --> 02:42:57,030
Kill the ogre.

2275
02:42:59,350 --> 02:43:00,090
There, see?

2276
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,130
I figured it out.

2277
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:06,790
And then with this, I'll just slowly...

2278
02:43:06,790 --> 02:43:08,450
Go over on the other side.

2279
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:17,650
holy shit okay that's sick that is actually sick though

2280
02:43:27,450 --> 02:43:35,990

fucking strong the big guys maybe not so much the big guys i

new...

2282
02:43:41,750 --> 02:43:42,470
Oh, nice.

2283
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:44,350
Nice.

2284
02:43:44,410 --> 02:43:46,210
I already have a new light attack, too.

2285
02:43:47,970 --> 02:43:52,850
In one of the upgrades, you can apply effects on your spears
to melee, like, poison, and fire more damage.

2286
02:43:52,930 --> 02:43:53,190
It's out.

2287
02:43:53,250 --> 02:43:53,970
Thank you for the super chat.

2288
02:43:54,110 --> 02:43:54,850
Thank you, thank you.

2289
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:56,950
Oh, I like that.

2290
02:43:58,410 --> 02:43:58,630
Oh.

2291
02:43:58,970 --> 02:44:00,610
And then upgrade this.

2292
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:10,120
I already equipped it, so I don't need to do anything to it.

2293
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:12,760
Oh, what about armor?

2294
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:13,820
Do I need new armor?

2295
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:15,540
armor?

2296
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:17,480
Ooh, I can technically.

2297
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:18,520
Ooh, wait.

2298
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:22,460
Ooh, but takes away my cooldown.

2299
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:25,220
But I get more luck.

2300
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:28,500
I like the cooldown more.

2301
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:29,520
I'm just going to upgrade this.

2302
02:44:33,260 --> 02:44:33,860
Yeah.

2303
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:37,880
I feel like that one's just more worth it.

2304
02:44:44,970 --> 02:44:46,250
Everything is just luck.

2305
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:54,160
Is there anything else?

2306
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:55,560
We're good.

2307
02:44:55,560 --> 02:45:05,760
I see how you'll be getting down From up here Uh Where's the
amulet I can add one more amulet

02:45:20,750 --> 02:45:24,310

2310
02:45:24,390 --> 02:45:28,790
Yeah I can Oh Oh Hello to Suffin.

2311
02:45:28,970 --> 02:45:29,690
Oh, there it is.

2312
02:45:29,770 --> 02:45:30,290
The elements.

2313
02:45:33,470 --> 02:45:34,170
All right, there we go.

2314
02:45:34,450 --> 02:45:35,410
That's the upgrade we needed.

2315
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:41,860
All right, yeah.

2316
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:49,340
Okay.

2317
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:53,560
I guess it has to be this, right?

2318
02:45:55,300 --> 02:45:56,180
Holy fuck.

2319
02:45:58,960 --> 02:46:00,380
Man, that's very convenient.

2320
02:46:01,480 --> 02:46:03,020
God, they left the rope here.

2321
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:05,420
All right, let's go down.

2322
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:10,560
And I'll give you those games working for you.

2323
02:46:10,980 --> 02:46:14,540
I only hope Sindri's in one piece by the time Brock's done
with him.

2324
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:18,260
The ice beneath those two is thin enough under the best of
circumstances.

2325
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:19,360
Yay!

2326
02:46:24,650 --> 02:46:25,610
Again, again.

2327
02:46:26,670 --> 02:46:28,530
Okay, this is where I'm supposed to go.

2328
02:46:28,670 --> 02:46:30,290
Oh, yeah, this is where I'm supposed to go.

2329
02:46:32,070 --> 02:46:34,110
All right, does Freya want to talk now?

2330
02:46:34,190 --> 02:46:35,130
Where is everyone?

2331
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:36,990
Wait, yeah, where is all the dwarves?

2332
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:40,210
Hello?

2333
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:42,270
What?

2334
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:43,410
Now a good time.

2335
02:46:43,870 --> 02:46:44,090
Oh!

2336
02:46:44,850 --> 02:46:46,610
I just want to talk.

2337
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:48,110
Dad to dad.

2338
02:46:49,490 --> 02:46:54,810
Speaking of which, imagine my surprise when Atreus came
knocking at my door.

2339
02:46:55,870 --> 02:46:57,610
He's doing well, by the way.

2340
02:46:57,890 --> 02:47:05,350
And will continue to do so just as long as I return to
Asgard sometime soon.

2341
02:47:09,220 --> 02:47:10,260
What a coward.

2342
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:12,480
Using a dwarf as like a meat shield.

2343
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:14,300
Has a whole lot to live for.

2344
02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:15,780
Arguable.

2345
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:17,320
Run along now.

2346
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:18,140
Let behave yourself.

2347
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:21,900
Run along now, little boy.

2348
02:47:23,080 --> 02:47:24,340
Never much cared for Brock.

2349
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:27,060
But can't deny the dwarf's talent.

2350
02:47:28,820 --> 02:47:29,700
You came to speak.

2351
02:47:31,960 --> 02:47:33,000
Dad to dad.

2352
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,120
Dad talk.

2353
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:36,920
Do you, Kratos?

2354
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:40,280
All that blood on your hands.

2355
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:50,840
On your son's hands I want peace as much as you do Perhaps
we can find it together He's lying

key your age to break free you did not do any of the work my

2358
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:28,440

homeland or rather did they biological dad versus stepdad

2359
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:40,480
what you're doing right it's like steve fuck off steve
that's my son you may meet the god i once was

2360
02:48:44,920 --> 02:49:02,200

lifetimes has anyone ever worshipped you ever prayed to you

2361
02:49:02,200 --> 02:49:12,260

care about mortals you don't care about anything beyond

2362
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:21,040
yourself that's not true but the Greeks conquered they
prayed for me you fear Yeah, the Spartans did.

2363
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:30,580
Is it any wonder that your boy is in no rush to come back?

2364
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:31,360
Yeah, he's projecting.

2365
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:33,980
Damn.

2366
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:38,440
Holy fuck, he's rage baiting.

2367
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:42,320
You know, literally just came over to rage bait.

2368
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:43,540
What about the dwarf?

2369
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:44,560
Where he left the dwarf?

2370
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:45,580
Showing up here.

2371
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:48,480
At least you rattled him as much as he rattled you.

2372
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:55,300
He literally teleported here to just a rage bait me and then
left his fucking meat shield.

2373
02:49:58,520 --> 02:49:59,960
Banana, thank you for the super chat.

2374
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:00,380
Thank you.

2375
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:01,020
Thank you.

2376
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:03,520
There's a reason why Odin is selfish and not a team player.

2377
02:50:03,860 --> 02:50:04,700
There's only one eye.

2378
02:50:04,840 --> 02:50:05,380
No, it didn't.

2379
02:50:07,580 --> 02:50:11,900
It's crazy how, like, um, I thought it was funny.

2380
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:15,000
It really felt like a dad versus stepdad situation.

2381
02:50:16,520 --> 02:50:17,140
Oh, shit.

2382
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:19,220
Wait, what?

2383
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,320
How did you...

2384
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:21,640
Why did you bring...

2385
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:23,880
Wait, why did you bring these people here?

2386
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:29,000
Wait a minute.

2387
02:50:29,180 --> 02:50:31,000
Why did you bring them here?

2388
02:50:31,240 --> 02:50:31,660
Freya?

2389
02:50:33,880 --> 02:50:35,240
Yeah, no shit!

2390
02:50:41,060 --> 02:50:42,400
Oh my god!

2391
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:44,760
It's alright.

2392
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:46,620
I'm okay.

2393
02:50:47,360 --> 02:50:48,360
This is just a flesh...

2394
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:49,120
Oh, fuck!

2395
02:50:49,660 --> 02:50:51,180
This is just a flesh wound.

2396
02:50:57,220 --> 02:50:58,500
All right.

2397
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:01,440
All right.

2398
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:13,620
There you go.

2399
02:51:19,630 --> 02:51:19,870
I'm mad.

2400
02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:20,670
Come on!

2401
02:51:21,550 --> 02:51:24,550
I missed that one time, but that doesn't matter.

2402
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:28,050
There you go.

2403
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:30,930
Jeez, they're so tanky.

2404
02:51:32,830 --> 02:51:34,070
Get juggled!

2405
02:51:35,130 --> 02:51:36,190
A drop near spear?

2406
02:51:38,330 --> 02:51:42,070
Holy shit, it took so much fucking damage, though.

2407
02:51:42,850 --> 02:51:44,090
Come on, I found a gate.

2408
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:46,130
We just need to take the train down.

2409
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:48,770
I do worry, though, if I'm being frank.

2410
02:51:49,370 --> 02:51:51,350
We've crafted a weapon to kill a god.

2411
02:51:51,950 --> 02:51:54,890
One could say you're on the verge of returning to form.

2412
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:58,430
Does it scare you, aiding another violent god?

2413
02:51:58,970 --> 02:52:00,550
I'm scared for you, brother.

2414
02:52:01,070 --> 02:52:02,910
That spear could start a war.

2415
02:52:03,130 --> 02:52:05,630
It's time for a self-fulfilling prophecy!

2416
02:52:07,570 --> 02:52:10,630
Maybe the Giants had you in mind all along.

2417
02:52:13,310 --> 02:52:15,670
Time for another self-fulfilling prophecy.

2418
02:52:16,670 --> 02:52:17,450
Let's go!

2419
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:19,930
Yeah, maybe if they...

2420
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:21,230
Even though they are...

2421
02:52:21,230 --> 02:52:24,030
If they were right, I got cool-ass spear, though.

2422
02:52:24,170 --> 02:52:24,730
Look at that.

2423
02:52:26,750 --> 02:52:28,110
That's fucking right.

2424
02:52:29,750 --> 02:52:31,470
So what if they are right?

2425
02:52:32,290 --> 02:52:33,890
Look at this sick-ass spear.

2426
02:52:35,690 --> 02:52:36,350
Okay.

2427
02:52:37,190 --> 02:52:38,190
Yeah, it's worth it.

2428
02:52:38,590 --> 02:52:39,070
Starting a war?

2429
02:52:39,770 --> 02:52:40,150
Fuck it.

2430
02:52:40,170 --> 02:52:40,670
Let's go.

2431
02:52:42,450 --> 02:52:44,290
It is pretty cool.

2432
02:52:46,650 --> 02:52:47,690
Gonna start.

2433
02:52:47,750 --> 02:52:49,930
We are gonna start a war with my Shadamu Spear.

2434
02:52:50,570 --> 02:52:51,710
Let's let you go.

2435
02:52:58,390 --> 02:53:00,370
So this drop near spear.

2436
02:53:01,630 --> 02:53:02,950
You're prepared to use it?

2437
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:04,150
To protect Atreus.

2438
02:53:04,990 --> 02:53:07,030
I am no one's champion but his.

2439
02:53:07,570 --> 02:53:08,490
Nor no one's god.

2440
02:53:09,290 --> 02:53:10,770
That may be my form.

2441
02:53:11,710 --> 02:53:18,070
It is not my nature thing is I know you guys want me to
shoot the crow but there's 48 of them And I don't think

2442
02:53:18,070 --> 02:53:27,270
that's possible There's just that's a little bit too many
crows and is let Odin watch the rest matters little there's

2443
02:53:27,270 --> 02:53:32,370
also the bit of news that Odin has some inkling of what
We're up to I thought I heard Ravens.

2444
02:53:32,490 --> 02:53:33,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

2445
02:53:33,890 --> 02:53:39,850
Yeah, I left one of them out there some more lies What did
you expect you think he lies that Atreus is in Asgard?

2446
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:42,950
On that, I'm afraid I believe him.

2447
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:45,070
Then the rest matters little.

2448
02:53:46,650 --> 02:53:49,350
I saw a gateway near here, overlooking the bay.

2449
02:53:49,710 --> 02:53:51,390
We can get to it with your spear, I think.

2450
02:53:51,890 --> 02:53:52,230
Oh.

2451
02:53:52,310 --> 02:53:52,910
This way.

2452
02:53:53,090 --> 02:53:53,310
Yeah.

2453
02:53:56,830 --> 02:53:57,350
Oh.

2454
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:59,930
Like gravestone, there's a keyhole.

2455
02:54:00,030 --> 02:54:00,250
Wait.

2456
02:54:00,990 --> 02:54:02,050
Be ready for combat.

2457
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:02,630
What's this?

2458
02:54:03,010 --> 02:54:03,510
Oh!

2459
02:54:04,950 --> 02:54:05,450
Oh!

2460
02:54:08,530 --> 02:54:10,270
That's right, for one now!

2461
02:54:12,210 --> 02:54:29,150
for what oh my gosh I did not expect a fucking a boss fight
though oh no this is he looks really hard guys oh my god

2462
02:54:29,150 --> 02:54:42,650
okay Jesus oh my god what there we go okay that might been a
mistake doing this.

2463
02:54:43,870 --> 02:54:47,210
Oh god.

2464
02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:51,260
Oh god.

2465
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:57,280
Holy shit.

2466
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:03,200
Oh man, I do not expect that.

2467
02:55:04,540 --> 02:55:06,500
I was like, oh, a tombstone.

2468
02:55:07,540 --> 02:55:08,900
I think I could do this.

2469
02:55:09,260 --> 02:55:10,740
I just gotta save my rage thing.

2470
02:55:16,900 --> 02:55:24,020
all right and i'll use this are you kidding me he can do
that

2471
02:55:28,920 --> 02:55:34,620
oh my god he got the purple hit nice

2472
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:41,900

2473
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:47,760
Oh my god, that's actually so hard to dodge.

2474
02:55:50,900 --> 02:55:52,580
Holy shit, I'm just gonna do this for now.

2475
02:55:57,520 --> 02:56:00,180
Like, I have to get the timing right for the parry.

2476
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:04,160
Fuck!

2477
02:56:04,740 --> 02:56:07,140
Like, I can't dodge that if I fuck it up.

2478
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:09,140
There we go.

2479
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:15,670
Okay.

2480
02:56:17,090 --> 02:56:17,570
Nice.

2481
02:56:22,050 --> 02:56:23,290
Fuck, okay.

2482
02:56:26,710 --> 02:56:28,650
There we go.

2483
02:56:32,310 --> 02:56:32,710
Okay.

2484
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:37,660
There we go.

2485
02:56:46,130 --> 02:56:46,910
Oh, fuck, guys.

2486
02:56:49,310 --> 02:56:49,510
No!

2487
02:56:52,330 --> 02:56:52,930
Dodge!

2488
02:56:54,430 --> 02:56:55,230
Because I hit...

2489
02:56:55,230 --> 02:56:57,090
I arm one before I jump.

2490
02:56:59,670 --> 02:57:01,450
I'm getting better though.

2491
02:57:01,890 --> 02:57:05,210
I R1 because I was spamming my R1.

2492
02:57:06,150 --> 02:57:07,810
Like I was playing Blood Boy.

2493
02:57:10,550 --> 02:57:11,290
Fuck.

2494
02:57:12,310 --> 02:57:13,030
That sucks.

2495
02:57:14,270 --> 02:57:15,430
Oh, that was such a waste.

2496
02:57:16,510 --> 02:57:18,210
I'm just gonna restart.

2497
02:57:18,650 --> 02:57:18,750
Restart.

2498
02:57:19,090 --> 02:57:19,790
Just kill me.

2499
02:57:21,810 --> 02:57:24,350
You mean four times the chive.

2500
02:57:24,450 --> 02:57:25,810
I lost too much HP there.

2501
02:57:27,110 --> 02:57:28,730
I fucked up the timing of the parry.

2502
02:57:32,110 --> 02:57:33,310
For the king!

2503
02:57:35,770 --> 02:57:38,030
Yeah, that king ain't fucking seeing you in.

2504
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:51,980
Okay.

2505
02:57:56,110 --> 02:57:58,930
There you go.

2506
02:58:01,840 --> 02:58:02,820
There you go.

2507
02:58:07,190 --> 02:58:07,530
Nice!

2508
02:58:08,230 --> 02:58:08,590

2509
02:58:08,910 --> 02:58:09,270

02:58:26,970 --> 02:58:27,730
Okay.

2516

2518

02:59:09,530 --> 02:59:10,710
Are you fucking kidding me now?

2523
02:59:13,190 --> 02:59:14,690
Yes, I am!

2524
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:27,660
Oh.

2525
02:59:33,560 --> 02:59:35,320
I want to parry that.

2526
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:36,400
I don't want to dodge it.

2527
02:59:36,580 --> 02:59:38,120
It's cooler like that, guys.

2528
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:40,900
It's cooler when I hit the parries.

2529
02:59:43,700 --> 02:59:51,580
Yeah, I know Aachen, but like, it looks so much sicker,
doesn't it?

2530
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:54,280
Does that not look sick?

2531
03:00:03,350 --> 03:00:07,590
You know it looks sick as fuck when I do that.

2532
03:00:15,380 --> 03:00:16,380
Okay, fuck.

03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:05,280
There you go.

2578
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:25,840
That's good.

2579
03:05:28,780 --> 03:05:29,500
No!

2580
03:05:29,820 --> 03:05:30,040
Nice!

2581
03:05:30,820 --> 03:05:31,540
Okay.

2582
03:05:32,740 --> 03:05:33,260
There you go.

2583
03:05:52,650 --> 03:05:53,990
Oh, he did it!

2584
03:05:54,130 --> 03:05:54,830
You knew this was so bad.

2585
03:05:54,830 --> 03:05:56,410
Do me a favor, brother?

2586
03:05:56,970 --> 03:05:59,590
You see any more of these ghostly berserker tosses?

2587
03:05:59,590 --> 03:06:00,550
Oh my god!

2588
03:06:01,270 --> 03:06:02,450
You'll be doing the nine realms.

2589
03:06:02,610 --> 03:06:04,030
Alright, but the pairs were sick though.

2590
03:06:04,490 --> 03:06:06,150
Warriors wrong you at some point, Mamir.

2591
03:06:06,190 --> 03:06:06,670
Amulet.

2592
03:06:06,890 --> 03:06:07,690
You're quite agitated.

2593
03:06:08,150 --> 03:06:08,850
Even for you.

2594
03:06:09,230 --> 03:06:10,810
No need to rehash ancient history.

2595
03:06:11,050 --> 03:06:11,970
It's all the same to you.

2596
03:06:15,190 --> 03:06:16,770
Kneel before me.

2597
03:06:17,010 --> 03:06:19,030
Well, guess who was kneeling now?

2598
03:06:19,490 --> 03:06:19,850
Huh?

2599
03:06:22,190 --> 03:06:24,510
Maybe you should kneel towards me!

Yeah, forward a king.

2608
03:07:41,270 --> 03:07:42,870
Maybe your king was a pretty ass.

2609
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:44,690
If you can...

2610
03:07:44,690 --> 03:07:46,270
You died like that.

2611
03:07:46,510 --> 03:07:47,330
Like a pussy.

2612
03:07:50,650 --> 03:07:52,630
Damn, I can't believe the king had you.

2613
03:07:54,330 --> 03:07:54,710
Speak.

2614
03:07:55,350 --> 03:07:56,730
Need you to get something for me.

2615
03:07:57,250 --> 03:07:57,630
A hammer.

2616
03:07:58,110 --> 03:07:58,510
A weapon.

2617
03:07:58,790 --> 03:07:59,090
No.

2618
03:07:59,690 --> 03:08:00,550
A forge hammer.

2619
03:08:00,870 --> 03:08:01,290
Little thing.

2620
03:08:01,970 --> 03:08:03,270
Symbol of the old resistance.

2621
03:08:04,170 --> 03:08:05,710
Gield, solidarity, all that.

2622
03:08:06,450 --> 03:08:11,350
Or it used to be anyway, till the Aesir buried it under that
big, gaudy dwarf statue in the bay.

2623
03:08:11,790 --> 03:08:13,750
Might do the dwarves some good to see it again.

2624
03:08:14,310 --> 03:08:16,830
You're not worried that might draw the Inher Yara's
attention.

2625
03:08:17,430 --> 03:08:19,950
The old father nearly slit my throat just to get to you.

2626
03:08:20,290 --> 03:08:22,130
I might be past giving a shit what he thinks.

2627
03:08:22,850 --> 03:08:24,410
Just find me at the bar when you've got it.

2628
03:08:25,470 --> 03:08:26,890
Is this quest worth it?

2629
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:34,330

I just not like fast-traveled to here

2633
03:09:13,280 --> 03:09:20,080
now that you have a weapon to deal with Heimdall we just
need to find a way to get to him hi if that's still the plan

2634
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:27,440
and you're a prop but freedom they can fight for their own
freedom guys the original plan to avoid I got my own

2635
03:09:27,440 --> 03:09:36,340
problems to worry about you know yes that's rather what
concerns me listen brother those things he said to you is

2636
03:09:36,340 --> 03:09:43,760
wood or nothing true though i expect retaliation is no empty
threat let's wait here the port is just gonna open up in

2637
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:53,780
front of me anyway you're getting ahead of yourself let's
see if cindry has had any luck there we go i just realized

2638
03:09:53,780 --> 03:09:59,800
i'd never i don't even need to actually run i just have to
wait for the door to appear

2639
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:10,020
Hey, ding, ding.

2640
03:10:13,420 --> 03:10:15,460
Does he want to talk to me?

2641
03:10:16,440 --> 03:10:17,640
You wish to speak with me?

2642
03:10:18,360 --> 03:10:19,760
I got one of your child.

2643
03:10:21,620 --> 03:10:22,100
One.

2644
03:10:24,220 --> 03:10:26,580
This one has a strong personality.

2645
03:10:27,300 --> 03:10:29,120
Good thing I've got experience with those.

2646
03:10:29,180 --> 03:10:30,660
Yeah, I figured out the meta.

2647
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:33,400
Gives you something to do.

2648
03:10:33,500 --> 03:10:34,920
Get my zoomies out, you know?

2649
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:40,300
There he is.

2650
03:10:40,540 --> 03:10:41,980
Think of the rope there.

2651
03:10:43,560 --> 03:10:44,900
See what we've done.

2652
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:48,520
Now do the thing.

2653
03:10:49,820 --> 03:10:50,380
Boop.

2654
03:10:50,880 --> 03:10:52,560
Oh, look at that.

2655
03:10:52,700 --> 03:10:53,600
It's beautiful.

2656
03:10:54,100 --> 03:10:55,440
She's special that one.

2657
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:57,400
Ain't gotta tell me.

2658
03:10:59,380 --> 03:11:00,960
Have you found a way to reach Asgard?

2659
03:11:01,900 --> 03:11:03,240
Um, not as such.

2660
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:06,240
Oh, whoops.

2661
03:11:06,460 --> 03:11:06,740
Sorry.

2662
03:11:07,440 --> 03:11:18,220
Had a few ideas, but they didn't so much miss click work

reason you expected it to flip sideways what no no of course

2665
03:11:45,570 --> 03:11:55,410

well they did and it was a proper adventure no just give up

2666
03:11:55,410 --> 03:12:05,270
yeah i need to think give up you're making up words again i

2668
03:12:12,650 --> 03:12:13,850
Epee time.

2669
03:12:21,400 --> 03:12:23,880
Why don't we just give him a new body?

2670
03:12:24,200 --> 03:12:24,420
How are you going, brother?

2671
03:12:26,480 --> 03:12:26,700
Sleep.

2672
03:12:28,940 --> 03:12:30,840
So we're just keeping blindly on then.

2673
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:33,460
Hoping we don't walk headlong into Ragnarok.

2674
03:12:34,640 --> 03:12:35,260
Is that your plan?

2675
03:12:40,480 --> 03:12:40,900
Oh!

2676
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:43,840
No more talk.

2677
03:12:44,600 --> 03:12:45,340
I mean, it works.

2678
03:12:45,420 --> 03:12:46,400
Like, what is he gonna do?

2679
03:12:46,640 --> 03:12:47,860
Open the door with his mouth?

2680
03:12:49,640 --> 03:12:50,380
Oh,

2681
03:13:00,820 --> 03:13:02,540
my dead wife sacks.

2682
03:13:05,040 --> 03:13:06,720
Oh, wife, I miss you.

2683
03:13:07,180 --> 03:13:07,820
Wife dead.

2684
03:13:10,600 --> 03:13:11,260
Ape sad.

2685
03:13:16,240 --> 03:13:16,820
Regret.

2686
03:13:44,910 --> 03:13:45,790
Think about wife.

2687
03:13:46,510 --> 03:13:47,210
Miss wife.

2688
03:13:50,450 --> 03:13:52,910
Sorry, this is a very emotional scene.

2689
03:13:53,430 --> 03:13:54,610
That's how I could think about.

2690
03:14:06,580 --> 03:14:07,740
Aww.

2691
03:14:12,550 --> 03:14:15,310
Oh my god, his chains.

2692
03:14:17,870 --> 03:14:18,470
Aww.

2693
03:14:20,830 --> 03:14:23,070
He's so tired.

2694
03:14:40,020 --> 03:14:42,480
I love the background music.

2695
03:15:12,510 --> 03:15:13,990
Miss my wife, don't you?

2696
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:19,020
Oh!

2697
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:24,960
Wife?

2698
03:15:26,060 --> 03:15:26,420
Wife?

2699
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:33,800
Oh my god.

2700
03:15:34,100 --> 03:15:36,560
Wait, she's not a big, giant woman.

2701
03:15:38,080 --> 03:15:39,880
Wait, this is false advertising.

2702
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:47,740
Think about wife.

2703
03:15:49,740 --> 03:15:50,440
Dream wife.

2704
03:15:51,760 --> 03:15:52,400
Miss wife.

2705
03:15:53,240 --> 03:15:54,140
Wife back.

2706
03:15:54,280 --> 03:15:54,960
Life good.

2707
03:15:58,890 --> 03:16:01,830
Well, your father seems very ready to go.

2708
03:16:03,370 --> 03:16:03,990
Shall we then?

2709
03:16:04,670 --> 03:16:06,430
we're we're reminiscing

2710
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:24,450
oh there's artaeus but piece of shit son yeah but she could
be eight feet tall

2711
03:16:30,690 --> 03:16:42,640
after knowing how my son grows up maybe i should crash the
boat little one your father and i traverse this river often

2712
03:16:42,640 --> 03:16:59,300
one day you will learn to navigate its waters we live deep
in the wild woods the most beautiful forest in all of

2713
03:16:59,300 --> 03:17:13,120
Midgard and it is safe leave even in my dream I have to work
here game is plentiful and you will want for nothing

2714
03:17:18,420 --> 03:17:31,690
we're not far from the your father and i first met we nearly
took each other's heads off but he's softened since then

2715
03:17:38,580 --> 03:17:44,340
somewhat unfortunately for you he remains dreadfully stoic

2716
03:17:51,400 --> 03:18:00,120
i finally see my dead wife again and all i can do is I guess
because he knows it's a dream.

2717
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:03,160
So there's no, like, reason.

2718
03:18:03,440 --> 03:18:05,400
I suppose it will fall to me to teach you language.

2719
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:08,460
Your father can teach you to hunt.

2720
03:18:14,230 --> 03:18:14,730
He's not...

2721
03:18:14,730 --> 03:18:18,230
She's trying to, like, not be too invested in this.

2722
03:18:21,010 --> 03:18:22,410
Roll boat for a wife.

2723
03:18:29,420 --> 03:18:30,760
Have you nothing to say to your son?

2724
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:34,620
What would you have me say, Faye?

2725
03:18:34,860 --> 03:18:35,280
Anything.

2726
03:18:37,380 --> 03:18:39,900
Let him learn your voice.

2727
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:42,160
Let him know you.

2728
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:42,480
Hmm.

2729
03:18:46,380 --> 03:18:48,800
He is far better off knowing as little as possible.

2730
03:18:51,420 --> 03:18:53,420
Knowledge is not always a burden.

2731
03:18:53,940 --> 03:18:54,220
Aww.

2732
03:18:59,450 --> 03:19:05,950
To think the mighty god of war frightened of his own child.

2733
03:19:07,310 --> 03:19:08,930
I do not fear our child, Rey.

2734
03:19:11,610 --> 03:19:20,530
for him oh yeah he doesn't know yet that he's gonna be a
magic user

2735
03:19:23,820 --> 03:19:36,660
we are not our failures we are not who we were we must be
better

2736
03:19:57,220 --> 03:20:03,880
huh Atreus is our future keep

2737
03:20:07,080 --> 03:20:11,440

2738
03:20:15,400 --> 03:20:19,760

2739
03:20:37,580 --> 03:21:02,490

2740
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:11,160
does he never dream about his first wife huh

2741
03:21:22,390 --> 03:21:24,510
God, are you jolted away?

2742
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:31,800
Because he killed her.

2743
03:21:45,110 --> 03:21:47,430
Oh, we're back to Arteus.

2744
03:21:47,670 --> 03:21:48,150
Arteus.

2745
03:21:49,250 --> 03:21:50,570
What did that wall ever do to you?

2746
03:21:51,690 --> 03:21:53,330
I'm building focus.

2747
03:21:54,030 --> 03:21:55,350
Something my father taught me.

2748
03:21:56,330 --> 03:21:57,110
Did it work?

2749
03:21:58,450 --> 03:21:59,070
Not yet.

2750
03:22:01,710 --> 03:22:03,410
So, what's your plan?

2751
03:22:03,430 --> 03:22:04,290

03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:09,540
All right.

2778
03:24:12,080 --> 03:24:13,040

03:24:22,180 --> 03:24:24,440
Everyone back home would freak if they knew I was in here.

2783
03:24:26,280 --> 03:24:28,080
Wait, what am I doing in here?

2784

We're next to the...

2786
03:24:33,300 --> 03:24:35,280
We're next to the parents' home.

2787
03:24:36,860 --> 03:24:39,120
I think my bow is fully upgraded.

2788
03:24:40,440 --> 03:24:41,560
They don't know that.

2789
03:24:41,640 --> 03:24:42,500
They don't know I'm here.

2790
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:43,640
Wait, they have no pillows.

2791

2793
03:25:04,140 --> 03:25:13,300

Oh, yeah.

2798
03:25:49,440 --> 03:25:50,420
There's Hamdell here.

2799
03:25:51,660 --> 03:25:54,700
Oh, dinner hasn't been, or breakfast hasn't been served yet.

2800
03:25:56,640 --> 03:25:57,040
Yeah.

2801
03:25:57,200 --> 03:25:58,340
I hate your mom!

2802
03:25:58,940 --> 03:26:01,380
I wish I wasn't even born yet.

2803
03:26:02,360 --> 03:26:04,380
That literally sounds like that.

2804
03:26:05,400 --> 03:26:07,160
I just had to check something real quick.

2805
03:26:11,560 --> 03:26:12,420
I didn't ask people.

2806
03:26:13,380 --> 03:26:15,120
Maybe Odin's down in this library.

2807
03:26:15,220 --> 03:26:31,840
all right let's go down check the library look even though I
killed her brother like she even liked him anyway I can't

2808
03:26:31,840 --> 03:26:38,000
explain it to you but I can't understand I thought we were
bonding stop letting a wife think for you she's clouding

2809
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:47,240
whatever's left of your brain this isn't about no it's about
your limitations Now go smash something, will ya?

2810
03:26:48,060 --> 03:26:50,040
Honestly, I like you better as a drunk...

2811
03:26:50,040 --> 03:26:50,680
Damn!

2812
03:26:51,660 --> 03:26:52,740
That's fucked!

2813
03:26:54,480 --> 03:26:56,300
Oh my god!

2814
03:26:57,280 --> 03:27:00,740
Oh my god, he's so sad now!

2815
03:27:00,920 --> 03:27:02,180
Dad's just dead!

2816
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:04,640
Oh my god.

2817
03:27:05,360 --> 03:27:07,620
The cycle of abuse continues.

2818
03:27:08,420 --> 03:27:10,460
Yeah, Thor definitely did not stop.

2819
03:27:11,360 --> 03:27:13,640
He continued the cycle.

2820
03:27:15,860 --> 03:27:18,300
What a great role model.

2821
03:27:20,240 --> 03:27:22,220
Father of the Year.

2822
03:27:23,260 --> 03:27:24,500
This is where you killed Amir.

2823
03:27:25,980 --> 03:27:26,420
Isn't it?

2824
03:27:27,680 --> 03:27:29,040
Generational trauma.

2825
03:27:30,740 --> 03:27:31,180
Tell me.

2826
03:27:32,340 --> 03:27:33,740
Can you murder a landslide?

2827
03:27:35,020 --> 03:27:35,940
Smother a storm.

2828
03:27:37,320 --> 03:27:40,240
It was more a force of nature, a vessel of power.

2829
03:27:41,340 --> 03:27:42,620
I was young, foolish.

2830
03:27:43,460 --> 03:27:52,960
saw an opportunity to create something more I know you think
it's cruel but I did what I had to to protect my own recall

2831
03:27:52,960 --> 03:28:02,460
your son better when he was drugged I build your house here
what's in there I'm gonna trust you I'm trying to tell you

2832
03:28:02,460 --> 03:28:10,540
in the wake of Amir's death I saw something the rift
possibly the birth place of reality.

2833
03:28:10,740 --> 03:28:14,540
I looked inside and something was there looking back at me.

2834
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:20,060
It whispered to me, things I couldn't possibly comprehend,
but I knew they were true.

2835
03:28:21,760 --> 03:28:25,120
When it blinded me, I thought it was over that I'd never see
inside again.

2836
03:28:25,460 --> 03:28:27,520
And then I found this.

2837
03:28:28,900 --> 03:28:34,160
And I knew that it would finally let me see the answers.

2838
03:28:36,820 --> 03:28:42,260
You see, son, I'm going to go back I don't know where I go
when I go.

2839
03:28:43,860 --> 03:28:45,620
There's no Valhalla for me.

2840
03:28:45,940 --> 03:28:47,560
Ragnarok cannot be the end.

2841
03:28:48,660 --> 03:28:50,380
I need to know there's something more than this.

2842
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:55,680
I need to know what happens to me.

2843
03:28:56,940 --> 03:28:58,400
No, he's fucking going crazy.

2844
03:28:58,840 --> 03:29:01,300
Trying to figure out the answer.

2845
03:29:02,320 --> 03:29:02,960
That's the truth.

2846
03:29:09,050 --> 03:29:09,970
The writing on here.

2847
03:29:11,070 --> 03:29:12,250
Talks about a cold breath.

2848
03:29:13,810 --> 03:29:20,510

take it

Heimdall will be joining you.

2853
03:29:52,960 --> 03:29:54,180
What a privilege.

2854
03:29:56,240 --> 03:29:57,660
For all of us.

2855
03:29:58,380 --> 03:29:58,400
Oh.

2856
03:29:59,560 --> 03:30:00,840
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2857
03:30:01,100 --> 03:30:01,280
Hold up.

2858
03:30:01,600 --> 03:30:04,120
You don't want to walk into the blistering cold of Hellheim.

2859
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:06,800
Without this, have free life.

2860
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:09,020
It should keep you nice and toasty.

2861
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:09,960
You're welcome.

2862
03:30:11,100 --> 03:30:12,220
Hell yeah, Hamda.

2863
03:30:12,860 --> 03:30:15,320
The mere city of an Odin couldn't survive the cold in
Hellheim.

2864
03:30:15,640 --> 03:30:21,660
You believe everything that old goat's Oh, not a chaperone.

2865
03:30:24,240 --> 03:30:25,680
Nah, we're going to make the most of this.

2866
03:30:26,360 --> 03:30:30,820
I have two, so does that mean that there's two people that's
going to help me in fights?

2867
03:30:31,060 --> 03:30:32,360
Or is time just going to watch?

2868
03:30:32,620 --> 03:30:35,960
I have something else to do for the Allfather.

2869
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:41,000
If you run into any trouble, just scream so I know where to
find your bodies.

2870
03:30:43,660 --> 03:30:46,180
Bro, better be a wingman, not be super lame.

2871
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:55,660
let's grab some money equip the mask okay there you go i
forgot how to use this finally i can test my skills

2872
03:30:55,660 --> 03:31:02,920
alongside the real valkyrie expert first off hellwalkers are
nothing compared to valkyries second i thought you didn't

2873
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:03,940
believe me

2874
03:31:08,360 --> 03:31:15,080
it has to be here somewhere there has to be a dead end
somewhere near here oh my god that's great it's just you and

2875
03:31:15,080 --> 03:31:16,380
me with no chaperones

2876
03:31:21,180 --> 03:31:23,060
Say, how does she...

2877
03:31:25,580 --> 03:31:27,060
What the fuck?

2878
03:31:34,260 --> 03:31:35,220
That's fine.

2879
03:31:35,660 --> 03:31:37,460
She can help me do everything.

2880
03:31:43,430 --> 03:31:43,610
Yay!

2881
03:31:45,450 --> 03:31:46,930
Of course she's cracked.

2882
03:31:47,010 --> 03:31:48,350
That's my future wife.

2883
03:31:49,650 --> 03:31:51,410
For the record, I believe you're right.

2884
03:31:51,430 --> 03:31:52,190
fought the Valkyries.

2885
03:31:53,030 --> 03:31:54,910
I just don't believe it was grandfather who corrupted them.

2886
03:31:55,170 --> 03:31:56,690
Or that he caused the desolation of Midgard.

2887
03:31:56,950 --> 03:31:57,950
Or that he had all the giants killed.

2888
03:31:58,150 --> 03:31:58,930
Am I missing anything?

2889
03:31:59,330 --> 03:31:59,730
Yeah.

2890
03:32:00,090 --> 03:32:00,850
Lots, actually.

2891
03:32:01,930 --> 03:32:04,370
Yeah, my grandpa... There's no way my grandpa did all that.

2892
03:32:04,450 --> 03:32:05,410
He was nice to me.

2893
03:32:11,630 --> 03:32:12,430
Oh, man.

2894
03:32:12,630 --> 03:32:15,970
She's definitely sheltered as hell.

2895
03:32:16,710 --> 03:32:17,390
What's that word?

2896
03:32:18,090 --> 03:32:18,710
I got this.

2897
03:32:19,410 --> 03:32:20,770
I'm just supposed to watch.

2898

I can't watch I mean I'll watch look at her go Wow she's

Amir.

2902
03:32:57,270 --> 03:32:58,210
It goes on and on.

2903
03:32:59,550 --> 03:33:00,550
And where'd you hear all this?

2904
03:33:01,230 --> 03:33:02,430
Freya and Amir told me.

2905
03:33:02,550 --> 03:33:05,930
Oh, so his traitorous ex-wife and a bitter former advisor.

2906
03:33:06,670 --> 03:33:07,050
Got it.

2907
03:33:07,310 --> 03:33:08,870
Look, you don't believe me.

2908
03:33:08,870 --> 03:33:10,290
She is so sheltered.

2909
03:33:10,510 --> 03:33:12,710
Either you're full of crap or you're a hypocrite for helping
him.

2910
03:33:13,450 --> 03:33:14,650
Can we just focus on the mission?

2911
03:33:15,130 --> 03:33:15,610
Damn.

2912
03:33:18,770 --> 03:33:20,950
Yeah, no, she definitely never left Asgard.

2913
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:29,930

too i know how hard it is to hear this stuff but you should

you

2915
03:33:39,070 --> 03:33:48,310
like okay okay yeah so what if my grandpa did do all that
you took it you accepted his sword why are you helping him

2916
03:33:53,080 --> 03:33:54,000
It's true.

2917
03:33:56,200 --> 03:33:58,600
Those are good points that she's making.

2918
03:34:01,900 --> 03:34:04,100
This is where the masks had to go.

2919
03:34:07,680 --> 03:34:07,840
Yeah.

2920
03:34:08,580 --> 03:34:09,740
We'll find a way around.

2921
03:34:10,880 --> 03:34:11,980
There's some way.

2922
03:34:12,340 --> 03:34:12,680
There's some.

2923
03:34:13,620 --> 03:34:14,840
Do something here.

2924
03:34:17,100 --> 03:34:17,200
Oh.

2925
03:34:17,380 --> 03:34:18,100
Oh, there they go.

2926
03:34:18,200 --> 03:34:19,180
They made me a little hug.

2927
03:34:19,240 --> 03:34:19,980
We're out of walkers.

2928
03:34:20,060 --> 03:34:22,140
That means we're headed the right way.

2929
03:34:23,920 --> 03:34:27,440
My grandpa potentially could be a murderer.

2930
03:34:29,160 --> 03:34:31,800
But like, he was good to me.

2931
03:34:33,780 --> 03:34:36,080
Oh my gosh, that should...

2932
03:34:36,080 --> 03:34:37,020
There we go.

2933
03:34:38,540 --> 03:34:38,940
Nice.

2934
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:45,360
Yeah, no connection there.

2935
03:34:46,020 --> 03:34:47,520
Oh, there's more stuff people here.

2936
03:34:54,860 --> 03:34:55,920
Oh, what the fuck?

2937
03:34:56,040 --> 03:34:56,920
There's more over here.

2938
03:34:57,800 --> 03:34:59,040
I mean, I could just do this.

2939
03:35:00,060 --> 03:35:00,900
Deer time!

2940
03:35:01,520 --> 03:35:01,980
Yay!

2941
03:35:08,740 --> 03:35:09,700
And just...

2942
03:35:09,700 --> 03:35:10,000
What?

2943
03:35:10,600 --> 03:35:11,020
Uh-oh.

2944
03:35:16,460 --> 03:35:18,320
Okay, I'll take these guys away.

2945
03:35:20,020 --> 03:35:21,340
Alright, that should be all of them.

2946
03:35:28,440 --> 03:35:28,900
Alright.

2947
03:35:29,140 --> 03:35:30,720
Can I go up here now?

2948
03:35:31,100 --> 03:35:42,300
there's a big hole up there now i got your way around they
are like quiet yeah yeah i definitely got this oh hey we're

2949
03:35:42,300 --> 03:35:51,140
okay right i guess maybe our families are just meant to be
enemies oh it's like romeo and juliet that's so romantic

2950
03:35:51,140 --> 03:35:57,780
what i do believe is that you'll make a great valkyrie i'll
tell your mom the same thing even if she scares the life out

2951
03:35:57,780 --> 03:35:58,240
of me

2952
03:36:01,380 --> 03:36:03,420
Now, we have a mask piece to find.

2953
03:36:04,860 --> 03:36:06,120
Alright, wait, what's this?

2954
03:36:06,960 --> 03:36:07,860
Falling sky.

2955
03:36:13,990 --> 03:36:15,750
Nah, my other one is better.

2956
03:36:15,970 --> 03:36:17,050
I like the damage more.

2957
03:36:18,150 --> 03:36:19,930
Damage means they die faster.

2958
03:36:20,310 --> 03:36:21,250
And I like that.

2959
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:28,040
Why stun them when I can just kill them faster?

2960
03:36:29,100 --> 03:36:29,520
Now what?

2961
03:36:30,020 --> 03:36:30,700
Not sure.

2962
03:36:31,060 --> 03:36:31,140
What?

2963
03:36:31,500 --> 03:36:33,460
Well, my gut's telling me what we need is here.

2964
03:36:33,700 --> 03:36:34,280
Oh, I'm stupid.

2965
03:36:34,440 --> 03:36:35,360
I forgot it's R2.

2966
03:36:36,500 --> 03:36:36,980
Sorry.

2967
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:40,400
I forgot his idea.

2968
03:36:40,600 --> 03:36:42,280
I was like, why isn't it working?

2969
03:36:44,540 --> 03:36:46,320
Just being a little silly.

2970
03:36:46,540 --> 03:36:47,100
Getting one's easy.

2971
03:36:47,980 --> 03:36:49,560
Getting good at shooting is the hard part.

2972
03:36:50,100 --> 03:36:50,980
Maybe you can show me.

2973
03:36:51,400 --> 03:36:53,000
I'll be the first Valkyrie Archer.

2974
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:55,460
Shit.

2975
03:36:56,520 --> 03:36:57,540
Could be our way up.

2976
03:36:58,000 --> 03:36:59,180
Let's head back down and find out.

2977
03:37:03,720 --> 03:37:04,740
Alright, push time.

2978
03:37:06,040 --> 03:37:07,100
Okay, pull time?

2979
03:37:07,200 --> 03:37:30,020

What's the mask say?

2986
03:38:11,100 --> 03:38:16,560
So the mask's pull is a little weird with all these
buildings in a way, but I think we're going the right way.

2987
03:38:16,800 --> 03:38:17,380
You think?

2988
03:38:20,200 --> 03:38:20,880
All right.

2989
03:38:21,200 --> 03:38:22,120
Another chest.

2990
03:38:28,150 --> 03:38:30,110

2991
03:38:31,570 --> 03:38:31,970

3034
03:43:33,710 --> 03:43:43,090
path forward clear as day she was born for this

two bad giants have to follow prophecy who cares make your

Oh my god, I'm so in love.

03:44:12,960 --> 03:44:18,200
I think she's gonna like, she's gonna like, um, what do I
do?

3042

You join my side and then she's gonna die.

Stop aside, little man.

3046
03:44:31,610 --> 03:44:33,670
And then his first love dead.

3047
03:44:33,870 --> 03:44:35,170
Well, his second love, technically.

3048
03:44:37,670 --> 03:44:38,170
Got it.

3049
03:44:38,230 --> 03:44:39,030
Sure looks like it.

3050
03:44:39,050 --> 03:44:39,450
All you.

3051
03:44:39,850 --> 03:44:40,250
Definitely.

3052
03:44:41,350 --> 03:44:41,790
Oh, my God.

3053
03:44:41,890 --> 03:44:43,410
I'm already such a good boyfriend.

3054
03:44:43,910 --> 03:44:44,350
Look at that.

3055
03:44:45,450 --> 03:44:46,570
I lied to her.

3056
03:44:47,330 --> 03:44:48,970
Built your relationship off lies.

3057
03:44:49,210 --> 03:44:50,250
Artea, it's good for you.

3058
03:44:57,500 --> 03:44:59,120
Just like your dad.

3059
03:45:00,800 --> 03:45:02,020
Oh, she's like, did you see that?

3060
03:45:02,340 --> 03:45:03,540
Did you see that, guys?

3061
03:45:04,380 --> 03:45:06,360
It was really cool, honey.

3062
03:45:08,920 --> 03:45:10,220
Man, thank you for the super chat.

3063
03:45:10,420 --> 03:45:10,540
Thank you.

3064
03:45:10,940 --> 03:45:11,260
Thank you.

3065
03:45:16,780 --> 03:45:17,660
Not bad.

3066
03:45:18,360 --> 03:45:19,380
Guess you make a good team.

3067
03:45:20,240 --> 03:45:21,320
Oh my god.

3068
03:45:21,480 --> 03:45:22,580
I think that's first base.

3069
03:45:29,940 --> 03:45:30,560
What's that?

3070
03:45:30,720 --> 03:45:30,940
Oh.

3071
03:45:34,240 --> 03:45:35,700
There's like a thing here.

3072
03:45:35,780 --> 03:45:36,720
So that means I have to...

3073
03:45:36,720 --> 03:45:38,020
There's something I have to do for that.

3074
03:45:39,820 --> 03:45:42,940
I hope I'm not trying too hard.

3075
03:45:43,300 --> 03:45:44,700
You think I seem too desperate, guys?

3076
03:45:45,280 --> 03:45:47,520
Or is that just the right level of desperateness?

3077
03:45:50,100 --> 03:45:51,440
It's like here.

3078
03:45:52,900 --> 03:45:54,060
Looks like it's through here.

3079
03:45:54,720 --> 03:45:55,820
But it's blocked.

3080
03:45:59,060 --> 03:45:59,460
Huh.

3081
03:46:05,710 --> 03:46:07,230
What if I...

3082
03:46:07,230 --> 03:46:08,370
Yeah, I was gonna sit.

3083
03:46:08,850 --> 03:46:09,090
Aha!

3084
03:46:09,510 --> 03:46:10,350

side.

Where I come from.

3095
03:46:35,210 --> 03:46:37,110
A bit too desperate.

3096
03:46:43,480 --> 03:46:44,740
Hey, what's over here?

3097
03:46:45,280 --> 03:46:46,780

03:46:47,340 --> 03:46:56,400
She should know the truth right Come sadly, oh, hey, you

No more, I got this!

3104
03:47:27,330 --> 03:47:28,010

03:47:28,110 --> 03:47:28,550
Disappear?

3106
03:47:29,270 --> 03:47:29,590
Nope.

3107
03:47:33,630 --> 03:47:34,890
But I can summon the three wolves.

3108
03:47:37,410 --> 03:47:38,050
The wolves!

3109
03:47:38,850 --> 03:47:40,510
Oh my god, okay.

3110
03:47:41,630 --> 03:47:43,310
It's not overkill, guys.

3111
03:47:43,990 --> 03:47:45,930
Holy shit, that's a lot of wolves.

3112
03:47:48,270 --> 03:47:48,730
Oh shit.

3116
03:48:01,290 --> 03:48:02,190
What the fuck?

3117
03:48:04,550 --> 03:48:05,590
There you go.

3118
03:48:08,790 --> 03:48:10,270
Jesus Christ, he takes forever!

3119
03:48:10,550 --> 03:48:11,070

3122
03:48:14,130 --> 03:48:15,610
Okay, this is actually a lot faster.

3123
03:48:18,470 --> 03:48:19,750

3124
03:48:21,250 --> 03:48:22,150
Roof force.

3125
03:48:22,510 --> 03:48:26,410
What is the power of brute force?

3126
03:48:29,110 --> 03:48:30,470
Oh, thank you for the rain.

3127
03:48:30,850 --> 03:48:31,490
Thank you.

03:48:38,770 --> 03:48:40,590
The mask is freaking out.

03:49:28,290 --> 03:49:30,110
Look, he just wants to be free.

3144
03:49:30,670 --> 03:49:32,190

Oh.

3203
03:53:58,040 --> 03:53:59,000

Bro has a blue checkmarking earning money from Twitter right

Shades of your shortcomings almost.

Yeah, he probably has Twitter blue.

3216
03:55:32,690 --> 03:55:38,230
If we could only somehow harness your uselessness, we could
fuel this entire city.

3217
03:55:38,550 --> 03:55:38,910
Fine.

3218
03:55:39,270 --> 03:55:39,950
It's all on me.

03:55:40,370 --> 03:55:41,690
Just leave her out of it.

3220
03:55:41,810 --> 03:55:42,830
I don't need your help, Loki.

3221

He doesn't even have Twitter blue.

3226
03:55:54,470 --> 03:55:56,010
He does it for the love of the game

3227
03:56:01,140 --> 03:56:03,900
We have a lot to discuss.

3228
03:56:04,340 --> 03:56:04,820
Loki, I'll meet you.

3229
03:56:04,900 --> 03:56:05,860
Yeah, he was a bad chaperone.

3230
03:56:06,080 --> 03:56:13,340
He was a bad babysitter Okay, yeah He went quite well Wait,
what?

3231
03:56:14,520 --> 03:56:15,860
Wait, he had another mission?

The mask, on the other hand?

3233
03:56:20,040 --> 03:56:23,300
Well, they are merely children.

3234
03:56:25,640 --> 03:56:26,860
I mean, that is true.

3235
03:56:27,900 --> 03:56:29,120
He's not wrong.

3236
03:56:31,280 --> 03:56:32,680
Like, that is true.

3237
03:56:32,760 --> 03:56:34,100
Like, what's wrong with that?

3238
03:56:35,500 --> 03:56:37,200
It's not even an insult.

3239
03:56:37,340 --> 03:56:38,240
I am a kid.

3240
03:56:38,420 --> 03:56:39,040

I don't want to hear it.

3243
03:56:42,200 --> 03:56:42,520
I don't want to hear it.

3244
03:56:42,540 --> 03:56:45,180
Everything was fine until you showed up.

3245
03:56:45,260 --> 03:56:46,240
I'll make it up to you.

3246
03:56:46,420 --> 03:56:46,920
I swear.

3247
03:56:50,780 --> 03:56:52,160
I didn't mean to.

3248
03:56:53,400 --> 03:56:56,580
How was I supposed to know the mask was in the wolf?

3249
03:57:02,320 --> 03:57:04,040
I didn't know that.

3250
03:57:04,960 --> 03:57:06,140
Who could have known?

3251
03:57:06,500 --> 03:57:08,220
Our first fight, guys.

3252
03:57:08,340 --> 03:57:09,540
It's just our first fight.

3253
03:57:11,020 --> 03:57:12,240
My little girl.

03:57:16,120 --> 03:57:16,580
Aw.

3256
03:57:17,900 --> 03:57:19,720
She's gonna do what she wants.

3257
03:57:20,380 --> 03:57:21,880
Wouldn't you rather I at least help?

3258
03:57:22,680 --> 03:57:23,780
Know where she's going.

3259
03:57:24,220 --> 03:57:24,880
Keep her safe.

3260
03:57:25,200 --> 03:57:27,100
No, I'd rather us be a team.

3261
03:57:27,980 --> 03:57:29,720
I'd like you to back me up for once.

3262
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:33,960
You're ruining what little relationship I have left with
her.

3263
03:57:34,300 --> 03:57:37,420
I'm doing the best I can to keep this family together.

3264
03:57:37,760 --> 03:57:37,760
Oh.

3265
03:57:37,860 --> 03:57:41,540
If that were true, you'd stand up to your father for once in
your life.

3266
03:57:41,880 --> 03:57:41,940
Oh!

3267
03:57:43,480 --> 03:57:44,280
You're right.

3268
03:57:44,620 --> 03:57:45,020
Honey.

3269
03:57:45,380 --> 03:57:45,680
No.

3270
03:57:46,620 --> 03:57:47,460
You're right.

3271
03:57:47,860 --> 03:57:49,200
Oh, shit.

3272
03:57:49,360 --> 03:57:50,840
What kind of example am I setting?

3273
03:57:52,360 --> 03:57:56,380
Seems the only thing I can do right these days is destroy
everything around me.

3274
03:57:56,420 --> 03:57:56,880
Holy fuck.

3275
03:57:57,120 --> 03:57:59,900
This entire family is fucked.

3276
03:58:00,920 --> 03:58:01,960
We need you here.

3277
03:58:04,740 --> 03:58:05,680
I need you.

3278
03:58:07,620 --> 03:58:09,940
I can't do this by myself.

3279
03:58:11,180 --> 03:58:12,400
Yeah, she's needed dad.

3280
03:58:12,560 --> 03:58:13,900
Not a cool dad.

3281
03:58:14,740 --> 03:58:16,460
Well, this felt too real, guys.

3282
03:58:17,860 --> 03:58:18,620
That felt...

3283
03:58:18,620 --> 03:58:20,440
He needs to break the cycle.

3284
03:58:21,320 --> 03:58:23,120
Thor needs to break the cycle.

3285
03:58:25,580 --> 03:58:27,380
That felt way too real.

3286
03:58:30,460 --> 03:58:31,500
Bro, someone...

3287
03:58:31,500 --> 03:58:34,220
Someone was writing from their hearts right there.

3288
03:58:34,500 --> 03:58:35,920
I really messed up.

3289
03:58:37,480 --> 03:58:39,400
It's times like this, I really miss home.

3290
03:58:39,660 --> 03:58:40,940
Oh, I can eavesdrop on Odin?

3291
03:58:41,120 --> 03:58:41,700
Well, too late.

3292
03:58:42,540 --> 03:58:43,600
Before you came here?

3293
03:58:44,440 --> 03:58:45,920
Someone who took care of you?

3294
03:58:48,320 --> 03:58:56,600
yeah that was really good maybe I could help you find them
without you know just screwing it up sound like a plan

3295
03:59:03,940 --> 03:59:22,500
someone knocked on the door hello Odin I come in I heard
what Heimdall had to say I'd like to hear it from you what

3296
03:59:22,500 --> 03:59:26,060
happened It wasn't there.

3297
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:28,760
I was wrong.

3298
03:59:31,600 --> 03:59:34,620
Well, we all make mistakes, son.

3299
03:59:40,360 --> 03:59:44,180
But freeing Garm, that was a big one.

3300
03:59:44,540 --> 03:59:47,040
Chaos is already spilling out into the other realms.

3301
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:52,200
We're safe here in Asgard, but everywhere else.

3302
03:59:55,890 --> 03:59:57,550
I think I want to go home now.

3303
03:59:59,290 --> 04:00:00,750
I fucked up.

3304
04:00:00,990 --> 04:00:02,830
I fucked up.

3305
04:00:02,970 --> 04:00:04,470
I just want to go home.

3306
04:00:05,110 --> 04:00:07,590
Run away from responsibility.

3307
04:00:14,650 --> 04:00:16,310
My dad's not that bad.

3308
04:00:17,370 --> 04:00:20,650
He's like, I think I wish my dad.

3309
04:00:22,910 --> 04:00:24,990
It's not that I don't trust you, you understand.

3310
04:00:25,950 --> 04:00:27,130
It's the company you keep.

3311
04:00:32,380 --> 04:00:33,640
Oh, and Ingrid?

3312
04:00:36,220 --> 04:00:36,760
Ingrid?

3313
04:00:37,760 --> 04:00:38,260
No!

3314
04:00:40,540 --> 04:00:41,140
No!

3315
04:00:43,690 --> 04:00:46,750
You want to stay with me?

3316
04:00:56,000 --> 04:00:57,900
My sword, girlfriend.

3317
04:00:58,200 --> 04:01:03,740
When you do decide you're ready to continue our work here,
Hogan will be waiting for you in your old home.

3318
04:01:04,720 --> 04:01:05,500
You screwed up.

3319
04:01:06,180 --> 04:01:08,260
Doesn't change the fact that you're welcome here.

3320
04:01:13,740 --> 04:01:17,170
oh and say hi to my mirror for me

3321

3324
04:01:56,650 --> 04:01:59,290
after launching an enemy into the air

3325
04:02:05,080 --> 04:02:10,500
I don't know I mean I'll do that but I think I'm gonna keep

3326
04:02:14,770 --> 04:02:16,750

3327
04:02:31,990 --> 04:02:35,570

3328
04:02:36,310 --> 04:02:36,990
Oops, wrong.

3329
04:02:37,410 --> 04:02:38,390
I mean, that's fine.

3330
04:02:40,630 --> 04:02:42,630
Are you still alive?

3331
04:02:43,590 --> 04:02:44,290
Oh shit.

3332
04:02:45,390 --> 04:02:46,290
Oh, what the fuck?

3333
04:02:46,450 --> 04:02:47,530
Where did he come from?

3334
04:02:48,670 --> 04:02:50,690
Better use the Mystic Gateway quick.

3335
04:02:52,010 --> 04:02:53,090
Yeah, there's the Mystic Gateway.

3336
04:02:54,250 --> 04:02:55,210
Freeing arm.

3337
04:02:55,990 --> 04:02:57,370
How did I screw up so badly?

3338
04:02:58,490 --> 04:03:00,010
Okay, wrong home again.

3339
04:03:02,970 --> 04:03:04,710
You had to Fresh and cured.

3340
04:03:05,250 --> 04:03:05,430
Yay!

3341
04:03:07,450 --> 04:03:08,910
He got XP.

3342
04:03:09,270 --> 04:03:10,270
I guess it's time to face him.

3343
04:03:10,450 --> 04:03:13,670
Oh, is he gonna show up from this door again?

3344
04:03:13,870 --> 04:03:14,150
No.

3345
04:03:15,890 --> 04:03:16,250
Almost home.

3346
04:03:16,830 --> 04:03:17,610
It's gonna be fine.

3347
04:03:18,370 --> 04:03:19,130
Alright, we wait.

3348
04:03:21,470 --> 04:03:22,530
There you go.

3349
04:03:24,530 --> 04:03:26,150
Can't believe I ran.

3350
04:03:27,650 --> 04:03:28,670
Wait, what?

3351
04:03:29,930 --> 04:03:30,730
It's you!

3352
04:03:36,690 --> 04:03:39,170
What the fuck happened?

3353
04:03:40,250 --> 04:03:42,110
Everything seemed fine earlier.

3354
04:03:47,480 --> 04:03:47,860
Yeah, I know.

3355
04:03:48,000 --> 04:03:49,700
I was like, what the fuck happened?

3356
04:03:53,640 --> 04:03:54,840
I'm trying.

3357
04:03:59,880 --> 04:04:03,460
Alright, nice.

3358
04:04:04,340 --> 04:04:05,020
Get kicked!

3359
04:04:06,740 --> 04:04:10,140
I'm not gonna lie, my melee is so strong.

3360
04:04:15,300 --> 04:04:17,100
Oh shit, I didn't even see him.

3361
04:04:27,990 --> 04:04:29,050
That's fucking right!

3362
04:04:32,510 --> 04:04:34,590
I need more power!

3363
04:04:35,130 --> 04:04:37,480
A spell?

3364
04:04:40,560 --> 04:04:41,420
I'll show you how.

3365
04:04:43,640 --> 04:04:44,300
Lassarifa.

3366
04:04:46,580 --> 04:04:47,240
Lassarifa.

3367
04:04:48,460 --> 04:04:48,780
Oh.

3368
04:04:49,760 --> 04:04:50,700
That's a refund.

3369
04:04:50,880 --> 04:04:51,500
Oh, shit!

3370
04:04:54,280 --> 04:04:56,440
I didn't know I was supposed to spam it.

3371
04:04:57,860 --> 04:04:59,460
Oh, and the dad's gonna save my life.

3372
04:05:00,440 --> 04:05:00,780
What?

3373
04:05:00,960 --> 04:05:01,260
Ingrid?

3374
04:05:01,900 --> 04:05:02,380
Oh, dad!

3375
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:06,040
Sorry, I thought about my girlfriend first.

3376
04:05:07,820 --> 04:05:08,560
Oh, yeah!

3377
04:05:12,800 --> 04:05:13,740
Oh, what?

3378
04:05:16,640 --> 04:05:17,140
Oh!

3379
04:05:17,760 --> 04:05:18,000
Oh!

3380
04:05:20,320 --> 04:05:21,920
I don't know if I like that.

3381
04:05:22,500 --> 04:05:25,000
I like the Spartan Furry more.

3382
04:05:25,920 --> 04:05:26,960
I feel like...

3383
04:05:31,120 --> 04:05:32,200
No, I still like...

3384
04:05:32,200 --> 04:05:34,720
Yeah, I definitely like the Insta Kill.

3385
04:05:34,800 --> 04:05:35,940
Which one's better actually?

3386
04:05:39,300 --> 04:05:42,340
Insta Furry or...

3387
04:05:43,920 --> 04:05:45,620
It's OP against bosses?

3388
04:05:45,780 --> 04:05:46,220
Oh, okay.

3389
04:05:46,480 --> 04:05:47,920
That'll use it for bosses then.

3390
04:06:00,410 --> 04:06:01,290
Oh, fuck.

3391
04:06:02,950 --> 04:06:03,910
Alright, it's fine.

3392
04:06:05,970 --> 04:06:06,770
Oh my god, please just...

3393
04:06:06,770 --> 04:06:07,750
You're saying two words!

3394
04:06:08,150 --> 04:06:09,330
You can say it faster!

3395
04:06:24,600 --> 04:06:26,500
Alright, that's how you get to Nidus.

3396
04:06:30,140 --> 04:06:30,540
Is it over?

3397
04:06:31,240 --> 04:06:32,360

04:06:32,540 --> 04:06:32,720

Aww.

3407
04:08:04,700 --> 04:08:05,840
It's all my fault.

3408
04:08:08,340 --> 04:08:09,940
It's not tears.

3409
04:08:10,120 --> 04:08:10,820
I'm just sweating.

3410
04:08:10,980 --> 04:08:11,600
They're everywhere.

3411
04:08:12,980 --> 04:08:14,740
That is not your fault.

3412
04:08:15,000 --> 04:08:15,900
Yes, it is.

3413
04:08:16,920 --> 04:08:18,580
Oh, that's why they were here.

3414
04:08:18,800 --> 04:08:20,060
It's because of the claw marks.

3415
04:08:20,980 --> 04:08:22,400
That's why they spawned here.

3416
04:08:23,880 --> 04:08:24,900
And I set him free.

3417
04:08:25,840 --> 04:08:27,060
I thought that if...

3418
04:08:27,060 --> 04:08:27,340

3433
04:09:58,220 --> 04:10:01,360
The roleplay's getting a little too real.

3434
04:10:06,080 --> 04:10:07,720
Give me a sec.

3435
04:10:07,800 --> 04:10:09,100
I'm getting loot.

3436
04:10:10,400 --> 04:10:11,200
Holy shit.

3437
04:10:11,660 --> 04:10:12,540
I can chill.

3438
04:10:13,460 --> 04:10:14,120
What is better?

3439
04:10:14,200 --> 04:10:15,520
Wait, what was the other one?

3440
04:10:15,780 --> 04:10:17,960
It was Furia.

3441
04:10:18,060 --> 04:10:18,780
Which is better?

3442
04:10:19,220 --> 04:10:19,900
Rath or?

3443
04:10:20,080 --> 04:10:21,560
Fury, guys.

3444
04:10:21,780 --> 04:10:22,480
I hate Valor.

3445
04:10:30,700 --> 04:10:32,000
Which is better, chat.

3446
04:10:33,200 --> 04:10:33,220
Fury.

3447
04:10:33,320 --> 04:10:35,440
I do like the life steal, honestly.

3448
04:10:36,300 --> 04:10:38,620
I like the life steal a lot more.

3449
04:10:41,640 --> 04:10:43,500
Alright, where the fuck is this squirrel?

3450
04:10:43,840 --> 04:10:49,840
I apologize for my brusque tone, but whatever has lately
transpired in Helheim is completely unacceptable.

3451
04:10:50,580 --> 04:10:54,540
I must insist you remedy the situation without... Alright,
fine garb.

3452
04:10:54,720 --> 04:10:54,980
Okay.

3453
04:10:56,340 --> 04:10:59,820
Helheim, post-haste, and undo whatever it is you've done.

3454
04:11:01,180 --> 04:11:03,020
Alright, before we do that, I gotta grab water.

3455
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:03,980
I'll be right back, guys.

3456
04:11:06,340 --> 04:11:08,980
And, might I add, never do it again.

3457
04:11:21,380 --> 04:11:27,400
And if you must imperil the fabric of reality in the future,
please do the courtesy of notifying me.

3458
04:11:39,300 --> 04:11:41,300
In advance, if at all possible.

3459
04:12:23,230 --> 04:12:24,290
I'm back.

3460
04:12:24,950 --> 04:12:27,150
Uh, Nexi.

3461
04:12:27,310 --> 04:12:28,110
Oh, wait, wait a minute.

3462
04:12:28,970 --> 04:12:29,910
Nexi, Medi.

3463
04:12:30,210 --> 04:12:30,970
Thank you for the super chat.

3464
04:12:31,170 --> 04:12:31,250
Thank you.

3465
04:12:31,250 --> 04:12:31,950
Thank you.

3466
04:12:31,990 --> 04:12:33,490
Ginger, thank you for the super chat.

3467
04:12:33,630 --> 04:12:33,730
Thank you.

3468
04:12:34,030 --> 04:12:34,390
Thank you.

3469
04:12:35,210 --> 04:12:40,050
Bringing a giant reality and ripping wolf from hell feels
like a bit too much as a metaphor for purity.

3470
04:12:42,610 --> 04:12:43,930
All right, here we go.

3471
04:12:46,150 --> 04:12:46,950
Got my water.

3472
04:12:48,570 --> 04:12:49,010
Damn.

3473
04:12:49,730 --> 04:12:50,010
All right.

3474
04:12:50,150 --> 04:12:53,110
Aren't you gonna, you know, reprimand me?

3475
04:12:53,350 --> 04:12:53,550
No.

3476
04:12:53,690 --> 04:12:54,550
We wait here.

3477
04:12:54,630 --> 04:12:55,070

over.

3482
04:13:30,890 --> 04:13:32,710
Oh hey, there's the raven.

3483
04:13:34,950 --> 04:13:36,430
Yeah, he has no rights to ask.

3484
04:13:37,650 --> 04:13:39,990
No rights to ask questions right now.

3485
04:13:40,170 --> 04:13:42,210
A desperate creature can be the most dangerous.

3486
04:13:43,750 --> 04:13:45,450
Not until we...

3487
04:13:48,050 --> 04:13:49,830
Not until I feel better.

3488
04:13:51,710 --> 04:13:54,530
And you cool down, and then he can ask his questions.

3489
04:14:02,900 --> 04:14:13,180
how far are we right now i feel like i i don't even know
what no why are you not working with him it's not what you

3492
04:14:30,820 --> 04:14:34,360
I refuse to believe I'm 50% now.

3493
04:14:37,000 --> 04:14:38,800
There is no way.

3494
04:14:40,940 --> 04:14:41,740
All right.

3495
04:14:43,200 --> 04:14:46,760
Wait, do I not have my fucking son to help me?

3496
04:14:47,320 --> 04:14:49,520
Like, where is my son?

3497
04:14:53,220 --> 04:14:55,700
Oh my god, I got two times.

3498
04:14:55,840 --> 04:14:56,020
Okay.

3499
04:14:56,580 --> 04:14:56,900
All right.

3500
04:14:57,140 --> 04:14:57,400
Okay.

3505
04:15:29,400 --> 04:15:31,440
He thought could solo it.

3506
04:15:34,620 --> 04:15:37,640
Alright, guys, so what percentage are we at?

3507
04:15:38,140 --> 04:15:39,100
This ice is in the way.

3508
04:15:39,560 --> 04:15:40,300
I will handle it.

3509
04:15:46,440 --> 04:15:47,700
The wind from your wings.

3510
04:15:47,800 --> 04:15:49,560
I can finally read!

3511
04:15:50,820 --> 04:15:52,080
Wait, what the fuck was...

3512
04:15:52,080 --> 04:15:57,020
Okay, was I just pretending not knowing how to read and it
was forced ahead to read for me?

3513
04:16:00,640 --> 04:16:01,160
Wait.

3514
04:16:01,180 --> 04:16:03,240
Wait, did I not need him to read for me?

3515
04:16:03,320 --> 04:16:04,840
And I could actually read all along?

3516
04:16:08,790 --> 04:16:10,570
Okay, how much more of the...

3517
04:16:10,570 --> 04:16:11,150
Oh, shit!

3518
04:16:12,070 --> 04:16:12,490
Nice.

3519
04:16:14,510 --> 04:16:16,730
Wait, so how much more of the game do I have left?

3520
04:16:16,970 --> 04:16:17,390
Chat?

3521
04:16:27,880 --> 04:16:28,760
Four hours.

3522
04:16:29,000 --> 04:16:29,220
Alright.

3523
04:16:33,460 --> 04:16:35,120
I have four hours left.

3524
04:16:38,280 --> 04:16:38,720
Hmm.

3525
04:16:40,240 --> 04:16:41,620
I'm like thinking.

3526
04:16:44,380 --> 04:16:45,560
Okay, okay, okay.

3527
04:16:45,860 --> 04:16:46,900
Someone said eight hours.

3528
04:16:47,320 --> 04:16:49,300
Okay, account for Doki time.

3529
04:16:50,640 --> 04:16:50,940
Doki time.

3530
04:16:51,300 --> 04:16:53,000
How many hours do I have left?

3531
04:16:53,960 --> 04:16:55,440
I know I have no right to ask.

3532
04:16:56,720 --> 04:16:57,420
Can you anyway?

3533
04:16:58,000 --> 04:16:58,940
One more stream.

3534
04:16:59,200 --> 04:16:59,260
Okay.

3535
04:17:00,180 --> 04:17:01,700
Why can you not tell me?

3536
04:17:02,080 --> 04:17:02,800
It's complicated.

3537
04:17:03,920 --> 04:17:04,460
What about you?

3538
04:17:05,340 --> 04:17:06,460
Why do you have a new weapon?

3539
04:17:07,400 --> 04:17:08,540
I thought you didn't want war.

3540
04:17:08,740 --> 04:17:18,640
I do not but all right, we'll do the last we'll do this
mission and then we'll call it There's a lot of yellow holy

3541
04:17:18,640 --> 04:17:25,620
fuck where where did my wife get all that yellow pain
Everyone keeps secrets Sometimes it's the only way to

3542
04:17:25,620 --> 04:17:28,860
protect the ones we love and don't worry about Odin.

3543
04:17:29,140 --> 04:17:33,040
I'm not going back there That is good to hear

3544
04:17:36,320 --> 04:17:44,860
Oh, we're in More dimension marks, claw marks, more portals.

3545
04:17:45,740 --> 04:17:47,720
I think I understand how Freya closed one.

3546
04:17:48,420 --> 04:17:49,600
Keep the enemies away if you can.

3547
04:17:49,960 --> 04:17:50,580
I can.

3548
04:17:51,060 --> 04:17:51,900
Let me know when you're ready.

3549
04:17:52,280 --> 04:17:53,000
I'm ready.

3550
04:17:54,320 --> 04:17:55,280
Let's do this.

3551
04:17:55,480 --> 04:17:58,360
I bet if we follow those hellwalkers up there, we find Garm.

3552
04:17:59,920 --> 04:18:01,020
How did he see me?

3553
04:18:04,820 --> 04:18:05,620
Oh shit.

3554
04:18:05,700 --> 04:18:06,700
Wait, how did he see me?

3555
04:18:16,720 --> 04:18:17,580
It's five.

3556
04:18:18,840 --> 04:18:19,980
I use my fist!

3557
04:18:22,120 --> 04:18:23,220
That's the last guy, right?

3558
04:18:24,820 --> 04:18:28,180
Oh my god, please, if you could just say those two words
faster.

3559
04:18:33,740 --> 04:18:34,700
Fuck it.

3560
04:18:34,920 --> 04:18:38,160
I fucking

3561
04:18:43,370 --> 04:18:43,770
run!

3562
04:18:44,130 --> 04:18:45,530
Get over here!

3563
04:18:47,910 --> 04:18:49,410
You don't matter!

3564
04:18:50,830 --> 04:18:51,630
That's right!

3565
04:18:52,170 --> 04:18:54,390
No one will remember you when you die.

3566
04:18:54,530 --> 04:18:55,230
Oh shit.

3567
04:18:55,690 --> 04:18:55,710
Whoops.

3568
04:19:02,950 --> 04:19:07,610
Technically you are already dead so no one's gonna remember
you when you're dead dead when you think about it.

3569
04:19:15,690 --> 04:19:17,290
But do I not have this power up?

3570
04:19:17,470 --> 04:19:18,070
Oh, I don't.

3571
04:19:19,090 --> 04:19:19,870
All right, give me a sec.

3572
04:19:21,930 --> 04:19:23,830
Oh my god, please boy.

3573
04:19:24,790 --> 04:19:26,630
Say it a little faster

3574
04:19:29,790 --> 04:19:46,850
Oh my god, he's ice Fire beats ice Oh my god, you're still
going I thought you finished What do you mean you're still

3575
04:19:46,850 --> 04:19:48,050
fucking shouting?

3576
04:19:48,310 --> 04:19:48,550
Oh my god.

3577
04:19:48,710 --> 04:19:54,970
There we go There we go I thought you finished last time,
whatever.

3578
04:19:55,230 --> 04:19:55,930
You didn't have to.

3579
04:19:56,430 --> 04:19:57,110
I am your father.

3580
04:19:57,830 --> 04:20:00,770
I will always help as long as I am able.

3581
04:20:01,490 --> 04:20:03,050
Well, that's good to hear, too.

3582
04:20:03,550 --> 04:20:06,190
Tell me, what were you doing in Asgard?

3583
04:20:06,930 --> 04:20:08,530
I was translating things for Odin.

3584
04:20:09,290 --> 04:20:12,810
There's this mask he found and a magical riff that's
connected to it.

3585
04:20:13,590 --> 04:20:14,690
It's all sort of...

3586
04:20:14,690 --> 04:20:15,290
Complicated.

3587
04:20:15,910 --> 04:20:18,430
Yeah, but I met people my age there.

3588
04:20:19,030 --> 04:20:19,530
Made friends.

3589
04:20:19,910 --> 04:20:21,570
You're kicking the undead while you're down.

3590
04:20:21,750 --> 04:20:31,110
and help don't be didn't have to go for me that's on them

Oh, I gotta use my shames.

Oh my god, they all want, oh my god, they were all like
worthy for combo.

But they, but I don't think they're worthy.

3606
04:22:58,500 --> 04:22:59,700
Yay, he is.

3607
04:23:02,800 --> 04:23:03,880
There he is.

3608
04:23:04,340 --> 04:23:04,980
Where's, who's he?

3609
04:23:05,300 --> 04:23:05,920
Oh, there he is.

3610
04:23:05,920 --> 04:23:06,940
He's carrying this whole realm apart.

3611
04:23:09,440 --> 04:23:09,860
Jesus.

3612
04:23:10,780 --> 04:23:12,540
I forgot about this ability.

3613
04:23:13,540 --> 04:23:13,960
How come?

3614
04:23:15,320 --> 04:23:15,840
Oh no.

3615
04:23:17,040 --> 04:23:18,520
You know what, I'm just gonna...

3616
04:23:18,520 --> 04:23:21,620
I'm just gonna do the slingy sling while I'm here.

3617
04:23:26,340 --> 04:23:27,780

3618
04:23:27,820 --> 04:23:28,720

3619
04:23:31,560 --> 04:23:33,260
Wait, where do I go?

3620
04:23:34,740 --> 04:23:35,800
Oh, there he is.

3621
04:23:36,560 --> 04:23:37,980
He seems pretty happy.

3622
04:23:41,660 --> 04:23:43,300
Okay, we'll go this way then.

3623
04:23:45,640 --> 04:23:46,300
Oh, yeah.

3624
04:23:48,940 --> 04:23:52,280
Ah, enemies are going to show up here, aren't they?

3625
04:23:53,320 --> 04:23:58,660
I was like, hmm, why is there a funny rock?

3626
04:24:01,440 --> 04:24:07,000
Yeah, I was thinking, like, hmm, I hope that rock is not
important.

3627
04:24:09,840 --> 04:24:10,780
That's awkward.

3628
04:24:16,360 --> 04:24:17,040
How am I?

3629
04:24:17,100 --> 04:24:17,640

Traveler.

3658
04:28:50,030 --> 04:28:51,610
I hate fighting these guys when they're alive.

3659
04:28:52,770 --> 04:28:53,790
Don't seem that bad.

3660
04:28:54,230 --> 04:28:54,390
Oh.

3661
04:28:56,590 --> 04:28:57,110

04:28:59,070 --> 04:28:59,990
That's fine.

3664
04:29:01,390 --> 04:29:06,690
I'm gonna say like, oh, it seemed pretty weak and I realized
I have none of my upgrades.

3665
04:29:09,030 --> 04:29:10,270
I'm so mad!

3666
04:29:11,450 --> 04:29:12,690
And I fucking run!

3667
04:29:14,010 --> 04:29:14,530
See?

3668
04:29:14,630 --> 04:29:16,910
I told you they weren't that bad.

3669
04:29:17,330 --> 04:29:18,270
Oh fuck never mind.

3670
04:29:18,530 --> 04:29:23,950
He's still alive My god, he can't even hit back

3671
04:29:29,490 --> 04:29:30,610
Oh shit.

3672
04:29:30,770 --> 04:29:32,790
Oh my god, I didn't think you actually hit back

3673
04:29:36,470 --> 04:29:40,210
It's bad switching arrows There you go.

3674
04:29:41,190 --> 04:29:46,550
He got stun locked so hard Get out of here!

3675
04:29:47,830 --> 04:29:50,450
Are you overcompensating or some shit?

3676
04:29:51,830 --> 04:29:53,310
With that big ass sword?

3677
04:29:53,910 --> 04:29:55,050
If you're not preparing for Ragnarok.

3678
04:29:55,070 --> 04:29:57,630
I was like, to fight back, I was like, wait a minute.

3679
04:29:58,190 --> 04:30:00,030
I didn't mean for you to actually fight back.

3680
04:30:00,790 --> 04:30:01,910
We are not the same.

3681
04:30:02,390 --> 04:30:03,290
I am the parent.

3682
04:30:03,750 --> 04:30:04,750
You're ducking the question.

3683
04:30:07,850 --> 04:30:10,190
Look, I didn't think he'd actually do it, okay?

3684
04:30:11,370 --> 04:30:12,270
Oh, it's here.

3685
04:30:19,570 --> 04:30:20,530
Oh, he's here.

3686
04:30:20,950 --> 04:30:22,890
Looks like it's not vulnerable to sigil arrows.

3687
04:30:26,660 --> 04:30:27,140
What?

3688
04:30:29,940 --> 04:30:30,880
Oh, okay.

3689
04:30:34,830 --> 04:30:36,990
I think my arrows will stick to the wood up there.

3690
04:30:46,750 --> 04:30:47,230
Yay!

3691
04:30:47,950 --> 04:30:48,610
Let's go.

3692
04:30:50,290 --> 04:30:51,690
God, thank you for the super chat.

3693
04:30:51,870 --> 04:30:52,370

Thank you.

3695
04:30:53,070 --> 04:30:54,230
Punching him a tight space.

3696
04:30:54,350 --> 04:30:56,950
Like, I'm pulling a nerd already in the locker.

3697
04:31:04,820 --> 04:31:07,140

3698
04:31:07,740 --> 04:31:08,640

04:31:09,500 --> 04:31:09,560
Are we?

3700
04:31:09,920 --> 04:31:11,000
You promise me you won't kill him.

3701
04:31:11,140 --> 04:31:11,380
Okay.

3702
04:31:11,720 --> 04:31:15,680
I make no promises, but I will try not to kill the beast.

3703
04:31:18,560 --> 04:31:19,740
Okay, I guess we go this way.

3704
04:31:21,220 --> 04:31:21,960
See here?

3705
04:31:23,600 --> 04:31:24,860
Or it's the big wolf.

3706
04:31:26,680 --> 04:31:27,240
Oh, well?

3707
04:31:29,680 --> 04:31:32,460
Oh, that I was gonna say there's no way this guy's alive.

3708
04:31:35,240 --> 04:31:36,900
Yeah, I fucking knew it.

3709
04:31:38,540 --> 04:31:40,160
Fucking knew you guys were playing today.

3710
04:31:40,940 --> 04:31:44,160
I was like, wow, two bodies just lying there suspiciously?

3711
04:31:44,840 --> 04:31:47,300
Yeah, a fucking course.

3712
04:31:47,960 --> 04:31:48,680
No way forward.

3713
04:31:49,640 --> 04:31:51,240
But looks like there's a notch in the wall.

3714
04:31:52,620 --> 04:31:55,400
I don't think I have an angle for this, do I?

3715
04:31:56,480 --> 04:31:57,680
You're spear fit into it?

3716
04:31:59,600 --> 04:31:59,820
Oops.

3717
04:32:00,540 --> 04:32:01,440
Yeah, I was gonna say.

04:32:03,380 --> 04:32:11,420

out an angle

3719
04:32:19,100 --> 04:32:31,440

3721
04:32:43,720 --> 04:32:45,760
This is like shooting.

04:32:47,400 --> 04:32:48,540
Oh, light runic.

3723
04:32:55,260 --> 04:32:57,260
Perform a fury of staffs with...

3724
04:32:58,160 --> 04:32:58,800
Press...

3725
04:32:58,800 --> 04:32:59,640
Oh, wait.

3726
04:33:00,960 --> 04:33:01,740
More damage.

3727
04:33:04,080 --> 04:33:05,520
Yeah, it's more damage.

3728
04:33:05,660 --> 04:33:06,360
And same cooldown.

3729
04:33:06,700 --> 04:33:07,500
So that should be better.

3730
04:33:10,160 --> 04:33:10,760
Alright.

3731
04:33:16,460 --> 04:33:17,320
What is your plan?

3732
04:33:18,020 --> 04:33:20,320
I'm sort of making it up as I go.

3733
04:33:20,640 --> 04:33:21,240
Oh, yay, freestyle.

3734
04:33:21,520 --> 04:33:22,760
You're not talking about Varm.

3735
04:33:23,340 --> 04:33:24,700
You cannot outsmart Odin.

3736
04:33:25,380 --> 04:33:26,480
It's worked so far.

3737
04:33:26,740 --> 04:33:27,520
Has it?

3738
04:33:28,260 --> 04:33:29,140
Oh, the players!

3739
04:33:29,960 --> 04:33:30,960
There's a snowball fight.

3740
04:33:31,880 --> 04:33:32,920
Never mind.

3741
04:33:33,320 --> 04:33:34,720
They just got murdered.

3742
04:33:35,600 --> 04:33:36,780
I was like, oh, that's cute.

3743
04:33:36,900 --> 04:33:38,240
It's like a snowball fight.

3744
04:33:39,160 --> 04:33:40,580
I'm going to try to tame it.

3745
04:33:40,860 --> 04:33:41,580
Tame it.

3746
04:33:41,620 --> 04:33:42,340
Tame it?

3747
04:33:42,500 --> 04:33:43,500
I've tamed wolves before.

3748
04:33:44,600 --> 04:33:46,340
I don't think that's a normal wolf.

3749
04:33:46,460 --> 04:33:55,260
is I don't know you see what I'm looking at but that does
not look like a normal

04:34:28,900 --> 04:34:35,300
Okay, I'll distract Garm you freezes change with your axe
and we can't run and latch him on to something I don't know.

3754
04:34:35,700 --> 04:34:37,580
Yeah, I was gonna say that doesn't let's move.

3755
04:34:37,700 --> 04:34:49,920

There we go.

3758
04:34:57,250 --> 04:34:59,490
Grab the chain links before Garm can escape.

3759
04:34:59,570 --> 04:35:00,550

3760
04:35:03,430 --> 04:35:05,330

3764
04:35:17,270 --> 04:35:18,390
Oh, fuck.

3765
04:35:25,570 --> 04:35:26,630
Okay, are you okay?

3766
04:35:27,590 --> 04:35:28,350
Are you okay?

3767
04:35:28,430 --> 04:35:29,590
We almost...

3768
04:35:29,590 --> 04:35:30,230
Your transformation.

3769
04:35:31,090 --> 04:35:32,530
Did Odin teach you to control it?

3770
04:35:32,950 --> 04:35:33,170
No.

3771
04:35:33,690 --> 04:35:36,490
We will not rely on what he taught you next time.

3772
04:35:38,050 --> 04:35:40,630
Oh, forget everything he taught you.

3773
04:35:41,350 --> 04:35:42,230
Holy shit!

3774
04:35:42,530 --> 04:35:43,630
Oh my god, he's jealous.

3775
04:35:44,490 --> 04:35:46,230
He's so petty and jealous.

3776
04:35:46,990 --> 04:35:49,910
He's like, how dare you use the stuff that he taught you?

3777
04:35:54,090 --> 04:35:54,650
Damn.

3778
04:36:04,700 --> 04:36:05,820
That's crazy.

3779
04:36:05,940 --> 04:36:08,940
So where's my...

3780
04:36:09,580 --> 04:36:10,960
Yeah, I'll use this actually.

3781
04:36:12,960 --> 04:36:15,060
Oh my god, get the fuck away from me.

3782
04:36:19,120 --> 04:36:21,180
We're returning that iPhone.

3783
04:36:27,190 --> 04:36:27,830
Alright, nice.

3784
04:36:31,410 --> 04:36:32,290
Why didn't that work?

3785
04:36:33,270 --> 04:36:34,610
You didn't mess up on purpose.

3786
04:36:34,970 --> 04:36:35,290
Did you?

3787
04:36:35,510 --> 04:36:36,870
Okay, you saw me grab it.

3788
04:36:37,490 --> 04:36:37,850
Sorry.

3789
04:36:38,370 --> 04:36:39,550
I was gonna say it.

3790
04:36:39,810 --> 04:36:41,830
There's no way you just said that.

3791
04:36:42,190 --> 04:36:42,370
Patience.

3792
04:36:43,530 --> 04:36:44,510
We will find a way.

3793
04:36:49,940 --> 04:36:50,800
But I didn't know it.

3794
04:36:50,920 --> 04:36:55,720
There is always a way.

3795
04:36:57,300 --> 04:36:57,880
Found it.

3796
04:36:58,140 --> 04:36:58,560
Do you see?

3797
04:36:59,180 --> 04:37:00,780
Oh, why didn't I think of that?

3798
04:37:01,040 --> 04:37:03,000
The solution is not always obvious.

3799
04:37:04,000 --> 04:37:05,840
I mean, it was pretty obvious to me.

3800
04:37:08,540 --> 04:37:09,020
Boop.

3801
04:37:10,600 --> 04:37:10,920
Boop.

3802
04:37:16,780 --> 04:37:18,380
Alright, now we do this.

3803
04:37:21,400 --> 04:37:24,120
Are you fucking- oh my- I hate her so much.

3804
04:37:25,420 --> 04:37:26,620
I hate her so much.

3805
04:37:26,660 --> 04:37:28,100
She just disappears!

3806
04:37:30,520 --> 04:37:32,780
Like, it's bullshit!

3807
04:37:36,920 --> 04:37:39,400
All she does is just disappear!

3808
04:37:39,780 --> 04:37:41,440
That's why I still lock you in the fucking corner.

3809
04:37:41,880 --> 04:37:42,440
That's right.

3810
04:37:43,920 --> 04:37:45,220
Oh my god, what the fuck?

3811
04:37:45,300 --> 04:37:45,740
Who are you?

3812
04:37:46,380 --> 04:37:48,700
We're part of this original fight

3813
04:37:52,960 --> 04:37:56,420
That's right, get stunlock get stunlocked.

3814
04:37:56,440 --> 04:37:57,160
This is a fighting game.

3815
04:37:57,280 --> 04:38:03,120
I got you in the corner We do this my way now.

3816
04:38:03,120 --> 04:38:10,500
I guess your way means it means what you think it means
Can't we try and we have the power to limit the harm this

3817
04:38:10,500 --> 04:38:18,920
creature can cause we will use it Okay, now she is so
annoying I'm glad I was able to like push her against the

3818
04:38:18,920 --> 04:38:20,040
fucking wall.

3819
04:38:21,120 --> 04:38:22,000
Oh, there you go.

3820
04:38:22,820 --> 04:38:23,860
Alright, tick two.

3821
04:38:26,860 --> 04:38:27,880
Can't get juggled.

3822
04:38:35,640 --> 04:38:36,680
Oh, what?

3823
04:38:41,180 --> 04:38:45,060
When I said tick two, I thought we were still gonna talk to
him.

3824
04:38:47,060 --> 04:38:47,760
Oh, no.

3825
04:38:48,700 --> 04:38:51,040
I didn't think I was actually a fight to die.

3826
04:38:54,400 --> 04:38:55,900
Oh, shit!

3827
04:38:58,540 --> 04:38:59,960
Oh, no!

3828
04:39:00,900 --> 04:39:02,480
Oh, I don't know my body.

3829
04:39:03,020 --> 04:39:03,620
I like this.

3830
04:39:08,380 --> 04:39:09,820
Holy fuck.

3831
04:39:11,680 --> 04:39:13,800
Oh, I got his paws.

3832
04:39:16,120 --> 04:39:17,780
It is beyond reason, Atreus.

3833
04:39:21,040 --> 04:39:21,800
Oh, Ness.

3834
04:39:24,720 --> 04:39:26,600
Okay, I didn't think I was gonna...

3835
04:39:26,600 --> 04:39:26,860
Okay.

3836
04:39:28,080 --> 04:39:30,440
I don't know if I like this, but okay.

3837
04:39:35,660 --> 04:39:36,860
Got him!

3838
04:39:42,720 --> 04:39:44,720
You leave us no choice.

3839
04:39:45,260 --> 04:39:46,840
We didn't want to do this, boy!

3840
04:39:47,760 --> 04:39:50,700
We try to talk to you nice and fair!

3841
04:39:54,280 --> 04:39:55,480
Oh, man.

3842
04:40:00,040 --> 04:40:00,840
This is fucking Chris.

3843
04:40:01,000 --> 04:40:01,560
What the fuck?

3844
04:40:07,260 --> 04:40:07,880
That's right.

3845
04:40:10,500 --> 04:40:10,900
Okay.

3846
04:40:11,320 --> 04:40:12,740
Yes, let's see why they locked him up now.

3847
04:40:13,440 --> 04:40:14,600
Yeah, now you can tell.

3848
04:40:14,720 --> 04:40:15,420
Yeah, yeah, no.

3849
04:40:15,540 --> 04:40:17,300
He's not very happy right now.

3850
04:40:17,880 --> 04:40:18,140
Yeah.

3851
04:40:19,260 --> 04:40:20,640
Do not show mercy.

3852
04:40:26,960 --> 04:40:27,740
Oh, shit.

3853
04:40:27,880 --> 04:40:28,680
Okay, that's my bad.

3854
04:40:29,320 --> 04:40:30,300
That is my bad.

3855
04:40:30,420 --> 04:40:31,360
Can I even hit him?

3856
04:40:32,500 --> 04:40:33,500
I don't think I can.

3857
04:40:35,620 --> 04:40:36,900
Okay, there we go.

3858
04:40:37,300 --> 04:40:37,760
That's right.

3859
04:40:42,360 --> 04:40:44,540
God damn he dodged it.

3860
04:40:47,600 --> 04:40:48,220
Holy shit.

3861
04:40:49,200 --> 04:40:53,710
Looks like he's getting ready to attack.

3862
04:40:57,070 --> 04:41:00,670
All right, dodge, dodge, dodge.

3863
04:41:02,370 --> 04:41:04,830
Oh, he's hacking up another hairball, I guess.

3864
04:41:06,570 --> 04:41:07,770
What the?

3865
04:41:08,490 --> 04:41:10,830
That was not in my fucking...

3866
04:41:10,830 --> 04:41:13,650
That was not in the red paint right there.

3867
04:41:14,570 --> 04:41:15,910
Excuse me.

3868
04:41:22,050 --> 04:41:22,710
Okay.

3869
04:41:27,310 --> 04:41:27,630
Okay.

3870
04:41:28,770 --> 04:41:29,430
Okay,

3871
04:41:33,410 --> 04:41:33,410
nice.

3872
04:41:37,470 --> 04:41:38,950
Alright, I don't trust myself here.

3873
04:41:39,030 --> 04:41:40,370
I'm just gonna...

3874
04:41:41,610 --> 04:41:42,390
He's gonna wait.

3875
04:41:43,370 --> 04:41:44,670
All he does...

3876
04:41:44,670 --> 04:41:45,110
Jesus Christ.

3877
04:41:46,610 --> 04:41:47,650
Oh, my gosh.

3878
04:41:47,930 --> 04:41:48,810
Still fucked it up.

3879
04:41:49,690 --> 04:41:50,670
Oh, my gosh.

3880
04:41:50,910 --> 04:41:51,250
So...

3881
04:41:51,250 --> 04:41:52,230
Oh, shit.

3882
04:41:52,730 --> 04:41:54,330
I gotta be angry.

3883
04:41:56,090 --> 04:41:57,930
I gotta start punching the dog.

3884
04:42:01,290 --> 04:42:02,870
I gotta do this.

3885
04:42:03,370 --> 04:42:04,510
It's me or him.

3886
04:42:04,930 --> 04:42:06,490
I need my HP, guys.

3887
04:42:07,450 --> 04:42:09,150
I really need my HP.

3888
04:42:09,330 --> 04:42:10,250
No, I just can't.

3889
04:42:25,880 --> 04:42:28,260
Let's just move, or just moving the stout, guys.

3890
04:42:29,040 --> 04:42:31,260
Dude, I'm just moving the stout.

3891
04:42:36,480 --> 04:42:37,080
Understandable.

3892
04:42:38,840 --> 04:42:38,980
Okay.

3893
04:42:40,760 --> 04:42:42,500
I'm pulling, I'm pulling, I'm pulling.

3894
04:42:47,080 --> 04:42:47,880
Arteez, please!

3895
04:42:47,980 --> 04:42:49,320
I don't know what you're gonna do, but please!

3896
04:42:50,280 --> 04:42:51,600
Oh my god, now I have to press the square!

3897
04:42:53,280 --> 04:42:54,880
Please, Arteez, please, we trade for this!

3898
04:42:57,880 --> 04:42:58,120
Oh!

3899
04:42:59,100 --> 04:42:59,360
Oh!

3900
04:43:04,630 --> 04:43:05,970
Is she alive?

3901
04:43:08,950 --> 04:43:09,350
Oh!

3902
04:43:14,100 --> 04:43:14,960
It is over.

3903
04:43:15,360 --> 04:43:17,040
I wish it didn't have to end that way.

3904
04:43:17,240 --> 04:43:17,560
Hello?

3905
04:43:17,880 --> 04:43:19,240
It's my fault he got loose.

3906
04:43:19,960 --> 04:43:20,540
That he's dead.

3907
04:43:20,820 --> 04:43:21,120
Hello?

3908
04:43:21,300 --> 04:43:22,600
Sometimes there is no.

3909
04:43:22,620 --> 04:43:23,800
No other way.

3910
04:43:23,920 --> 04:43:24,240
Oh.

3911
04:43:27,160 --> 04:43:27,640
Oh.

3912
04:43:35,960 --> 04:43:36,880
Oh.

3913
04:43:39,490 --> 04:43:40,290
Oh.

3914
04:43:44,280 --> 04:43:45,200
Oh.

3915
04:43:45,200 --> 04:43:45,980
This is bad.

3916
04:43:47,280 --> 04:43:48,200
Oh.

3917
04:43:48,940 --> 04:43:49,800
This is bad.

3918
04:43:51,500 --> 04:43:51,680
Oh.

3919
04:43:53,880 --> 04:43:54,780
Oh.

3920
04:43:55,440 --> 04:43:56,360
Oh.

3921
04:43:57,120 --> 04:43:58,040
Oh.

3922
04:43:58,040 --> 04:43:59,240
You did this joke.

3923
04:43:59,320 --> 04:44:00,020
I did it.

3924
04:44:00,020 --> 04:44:00,580
No.

3925
04:44:01,560 --> 04:44:03,040
I thought we were just gonna choke.

3926
04:44:03,060 --> 04:44:04,120
We need him!

3927
04:44:05,460 --> 04:44:07,060
I thought we were still...

3928
04:44:07,660 --> 04:44:08,560
Oh no!

3929
04:44:08,900 --> 04:44:09,720
Can we just go home now?

3930
04:44:10,340 --> 04:44:11,400
I know.

3931
04:44:12,260 --> 04:44:14,160
Close my heart to it.

3932
04:44:14,660 --> 04:44:15,340
Aww.

3933
04:44:16,120 --> 04:44:18,740
I didn't think we were actually gonna kill him.

3934
04:44:22,680 --> 04:44:24,040
I thought...

3935
04:44:24,040 --> 04:44:26,660
I really thought...

3936
04:44:26,660 --> 04:44:27,700
Oh no!

3937
04:44:33,440 --> 04:44:35,060
What do I do?

3938
04:44:38,340 --> 04:44:39,400
What do I do?

3939
04:44:44,870 --> 04:44:45,890
Oh my god.

3940
04:44:47,010 --> 04:44:47,690
That's fucked.

3941
04:44:55,720 --> 04:44:58,680
Maybe we can use my sigils to carry the frost to the gear.

3942
04:45:03,900 --> 04:45:04,380
Nice.

3943
04:45:05,320 --> 04:45:08,840
I thought like, you know, we're still gonna have a talk.

3944
04:45:09,040 --> 04:45:09,900
Go before it unfreezes.

3945
04:45:10,080 --> 04:45:11,660

Just giving him a really tight hug.

3957
04:47:19,980 --> 04:47:22,080
Because he didn't feel a lot of love back then.

3958
04:47:23,720 --> 04:47:26,760
Oh, fuck.

3959
04:47:28,900 --> 04:47:30,620
Guys, I don't think he liked my hug.

3960
04:47:31,460 --> 04:47:33,860
I think he's very, very mad about that hug.

3961
04:47:34,960 --> 04:47:35,000
Oh.

3962
04:47:38,720 --> 04:47:39,980

04:47:42,780 --> 04:47:43,780
Wait, now we fight?

3964
04:47:43,920 --> 04:47:45,300
What the fuck was that before?

3965
04:47:46,460 --> 04:47:48,320
What do you mean now we fight?

3966
04:47:50,500 --> 04:47:57,040
I was gonna say, what the fuck do you mean?

3967
04:47:57,140 --> 04:47:58,100
Now we fight.

3968
04:47:59,120 --> 04:48:00,860
I thought we were already fighting.

3969
04:48:05,180 --> 04:48:05,840
Okay.

3970
04:48:09,120 --> 04:48:17,610

Oh my god, he's so close.

3978
04:48:52,030 --> 04:48:54,990
I could see that.

3979
04:48:55,310 --> 04:48:56,310
How does he keep that back?

3980
04:48:56,310 --> 04:48:56,850
Wait, what?

3981
04:48:57,110 --> 04:48:58,050
That is his nature.

3982
04:48:58,550 --> 04:48:59,550
We gotta change that.

3983
04:48:59,850 --> 04:49:01,990
How do we change his nature?

3984
04:49:02,430 --> 04:49:03,810
What do you mean?

3985
04:49:04,250 --> 04:49:05,990

What the fuck?

4003
04:50:10,950 --> 04:50:13,230

04:50:51,790 --> 04:50:51,790
knife.

4008
04:50:52,410 --> 04:50:56,670
Did I transfer my dog so oh It's nature.

04:51:10,990 --> 04:51:15,350
Why I saw prophecy You were

4012
04:51:19,330 --> 04:51:20,470
That is so smart.

4013
04:51:21,070 --> 04:51:21,750
I saw it too.

4014
04:51:22,510 --> 04:51:23,110
In Jotunheim.

4015
04:51:23,910 --> 04:51:25,390
You knew?

4016
04:51:27,090 --> 04:51:28,890
That's why you've been training me so hard.

4017
04:51:29,630 --> 04:51:33,810
One day, you will have to survive without me.

4018
04:51:34,290 --> 04:51:35,030
Not gonna happen.

4019
04:51:36,090 --> 04:51:36,890
I won't let it.

4020
04:51:37,450 --> 04:51:40,050
What's that trick called when you skateboard on the chain?

4021
04:51:40,230 --> 04:51:41,850
Or like, on a handrail.

4022
04:51:42,210 --> 04:51:42,710
Not like that.

4023
04:51:45,510 --> 04:51:48,070
Is that, because my son just did that, was pretty rad.

4024
04:51:50,810 --> 04:51:54,990
oh oh my god yeah he was grinding oh

4025

dog heaven though oh my god he's so big it's possible it's

4029
04:52:59,420 --> 04:53:03,320
giant magic Graham was, like, soulless, right?

4030
04:53:03,820 --> 04:53:08,160
He is so cute.

4031
04:53:11,800 --> 04:53:13,080
Oh, yeah.

4032
04:53:13,380 --> 04:53:15,000
He was in the dagger the whole time.

4033
04:53:20,000 --> 04:53:22,380
That's why Graham didn't listen to us.

4034
04:53:27,060 --> 04:53:27,500
Oh.

4035
04:53:28,220 --> 04:53:31,160
That's why his eyes were, like, pure white, too.

4036
04:53:31,680 --> 04:53:34,240
Like the other soulless animals we saw.

4037
04:53:35,240 --> 04:53:36,960
Oh my god, what the fuck?

4038
04:53:37,940 --> 04:53:40,920
Wait, we have the fastest fast travel.

4039
04:53:41,120 --> 04:53:42,040
Oh, he left us.

4040
04:53:43,320 --> 04:53:46,200
Okay, then you could have, you know, waited for us.

4041
04:53:54,750 --> 04:53:55,670
That is...

4042
04:53:55,670 --> 04:54:00,250
Okay, the teleporting dog didn't teleport us with him.

4043
04:54:05,950 --> 04:54:08,230
That is so cute.

4044
04:54:08,610 --> 04:54:10,550
Yeah, Pro could have given us a ride.

4045
04:54:11,050 --> 04:54:13,270
You know, after we brought him back to reality.

4046
04:54:14,470 --> 04:54:15,050
Oh my god.

4047
04:54:15,630 --> 04:54:19,410
It was like when Arteus put a fucking soul into a snake.

4048
04:54:21,390 --> 04:54:24,390
That means the giant was actually like, what the fuck?

4049
04:54:24,690 --> 04:54:26,470
Why am I in a snake's body?

4050
04:54:26,710 --> 04:54:28,090
I was promised like

4051
04:54:33,210 --> 04:54:36,470
so they do know what the fuck is going on.

4052
04:54:36,970 --> 04:54:39,670
Arteus, that's fucked up when you put a soul into snake's
body.

4053
04:54:40,070 --> 04:54:47,170
I just assumed the snake would still be like acting like a
snake but like that giant was 100% aware like he was

4054
04:54:47,170 --> 04:54:55,750
definitely self-aware yeah because I was like okay that's
fucked up our chance but I'm like maybe the giant like you

4055
04:54:55,750 --> 04:55:08,410
know maybe he he's he just he's just a snake now but no he
that's pretty fucked up man great it's open maybe we can use

4056
04:55:08,410 --> 04:55:18,270
the sigils to freeze the gear up there Edward actually is
don't hate me don't you answer thank you let's super chat he

4057
04:55:18,270 --> 04:55:34,510

yeah bro that's that's pretty fucked up bro how

4058
04:55:41,160 --> 04:55:46,100
do I do it on the other side though I think we're

4059
04:55:50,200 --> 04:55:53,460
Yeah, but...

4060
04:55:53,460 --> 04:55:53,880
What?

4061
04:56:00,730 --> 04:56:01,490
Oh, there.

4062
04:56:07,450 --> 04:56:09,430
That's actually so messed up.

4063
04:56:09,930 --> 04:56:12,650
Because if Venio, like, actually came back.

4064
04:56:14,490 --> 04:56:18,030
When it comes to your life, I can take no chances.

4065
04:56:19,490 --> 04:56:23,170
I'm surprised the chat just wad up for how messed up that
wake-up.

4066
04:56:23,450 --> 04:56:25,090
I don't think he must have been that way.

4067
04:56:25,110 --> 04:56:28,450
Like, I don't even know.

4068
04:56:28,830 --> 04:56:32,150
I don't even know how to react in that situation at that
point.

4069
04:56:32,650 --> 04:56:34,230
I just guess I just slither away.

4070
04:56:34,530 --> 04:56:36,490
I'm like, I guess this is my life now.

4071
04:56:37,170 --> 04:56:40,730
Like, you just woke up as a snake.

4072
04:56:41,470 --> 04:56:43,390
And you just gotta accept it.

4073
04:56:46,530 --> 04:56:48,330
You can't even talk.

4074
04:56:53,360 --> 04:56:54,380
I go to here?

4075
04:57:01,100 --> 04:57:03,280
Oh shit, that's a giant bird.

4076
04:57:04,000 --> 04:57:05,140
Do I have any more souls?

4077
04:57:06,460 --> 04:57:07,560
Should we talk to her?

4078
04:57:09,820 --> 04:57:11,640
Wait, is she also soulless?

4079
04:57:13,620 --> 04:57:13,940
Hello?

4080
04:57:22,160 --> 04:57:25,260
I was like, why is there a giant bird here?

4081
04:57:29,280 --> 04:57:30,520
Who put a giant bird?

4082
04:57:30,540 --> 04:57:35,840
that bird too jesus

4083
04:57:43,020 --> 04:57:51,960
she says there's six tears to close and uh not to expect
things they shouldn't have been open in the first place she

4084
04:57:51,960 --> 04:58:02,680
is not wrong oh does she want uh besides she watched from
afar now by recent When we have opened six tiers to hell,

4085
04:58:02,820 --> 04:58:04,000
um...

4086
04:58:04,000 --> 04:58:05,400
She is not pleased.

4087
04:58:05,880 --> 04:58:06,160
Alright.

4088
04:58:06,860 --> 04:58:07,140
Well.

4089
04:58:08,100 --> 04:58:10,000
You cannot deal with that.

4090
04:58:15,660 --> 04:58:18,500
Oh, he woke up blind, too.

4091
04:58:18,900 --> 04:58:19,760
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

4092
04:58:20,040 --> 04:58:20,860
Snakes are blind.

4093
04:58:20,900 --> 04:58:21,500
Oh, yeah.

4094
04:58:23,380 --> 04:58:24,500
He's like...

4095
04:58:26,840 --> 04:58:28,140
Maybe he didn't even know.

4096
04:58:28,140 --> 04:58:30,040
He didn't even know there are people in front of him.

4097
04:58:32,140 --> 04:58:33,120
Bro, Arteus.

4098
04:58:33,260 --> 04:58:34,400

Nothing is written.

4122
05:02:08,500 --> 05:02:09,060
That can't be a new dog.

4123
05:02:09,060 --> 05:02:10,140
Oh my god.

4124
05:02:10,980 --> 05:02:20,600
We shouldn't let prophecy things can only go up then we will

Sindri's?

No.

4152

First, we retrieve Mamir.

4153
05:05:07,740 --> 05:05:09,840
Then you can tell us what you learned in Asgard.

4154
05:05:10,060 --> 05:05:10,360
Solid.

Thank you.

4163
05:05:20,960 --> 05:05:29,620
to odin yeah the relationship is so what's the word really
sweet i tried convincing her of that but when was that oh

4164
05:05:29,620 --> 05:05:35,060
before i started telling you where i was like you know after
they made up and everything before then it was pretty

4165
05:05:35,060 --> 05:05:41,600
traumatic but like now now it's like wholesome now it's
pretty wholesome before then i will say their their

4166
05:05:41,600 --> 05:05:50,080
relationship was pretty traumatic slash a little bit abusive
but now it's better now it's a lot better yeah they

4167
05:05:50,080 --> 05:05:51,940
definitely grew a lot as characters

4168
05:05:59,840 --> 05:06:06,620
yeah that's character development you got better at
parenting

4169
05:06:09,860 --> 05:06:19,940
hello hello everyone you're back how did it go ruby should
trouble us no further well that's a bloody relief so you put

4170
05:06:19,940 --> 05:06:32,540
down old garm did you yeah sort of atreus your decision to
go to after all he's put us through I'll never understand it

4171
05:06:32,540 --> 05:06:43,120
but I hope you at least came back with something we can use
I hope so too come on let me show you what Odin's up to no

4172
05:06:43,120 --> 05:06:55,100
here's what he cares about most more than Ragnarok or
anything is this mask anyone recognize it that thing oh it's

4173
05:06:55,100 --> 05:07:01,520
dead end he's been faffing around with that since before i
knew him why isn't he looking honest i thought the giants

4174
05:07:01,520 --> 05:07:15,460
were just having a laugh with that one wait he knows okay
fine but he knows about the mask oh you're wrong amir this

4175
05:07:15,460 --> 05:07:28,610
mask is no fraud the giants didn't make it and only a few of
them ever glimpsed it in origin but some believed it was a

4176
05:07:28,610 --> 05:07:35,750
way to gaze into the secrets of creation itself is it an
oracle much much more

4177
05:07:39,470 --> 05:07:50,410
imagine becoming one with a source of infinite knowledge
this this is why odin tortured me

4178
05:07:53,690 --> 05:08:05,050
oh so that's how odin found out about the mass now what no
it no it's one obsession he never saw fit to share with me

4179
05:08:05,050 --> 05:08:16,310
but I'll tell you this even when Odin speaks the truth his
purpose is false either way it's a mistake to let it

4180
05:08:16,310 --> 05:08:34,340
distract us is Heimdall our focus or not we will rewrite our
fate then i'm going back to vanaheim huh if we're not taking

4181
05:08:34,340 --> 05:08:45,020
the fight to odin i should help my brother stand against him
but is this not what the what if this is what the fate

4182
05:08:47,500 --> 05:08:59,380
foresaw like we don't know what we do lead us to the
prophecy anything can lead us to it i'm gonna study my notes

4183
05:08:59,380 --> 05:09:09,460
on the mask see if i can think of a plan travel if you want
to go anywhere i'm with you and listen everyone where's the

4184
05:09:09,460 --> 05:09:18,360
wolf sorry about the way i left you know i've never heard
any of you on purpose well when you can turn into a bear by

4185
05:09:18,360 --> 05:09:29,380
accident i suppose these things can happen so do you forgive
me of course atreus we know you meant no harm He's just a

4186
05:09:29,380 --> 05:09:29,880
kid.

4187
05:09:30,820 --> 05:09:31,480
I'm sure I will.

4188
05:09:35,460 --> 05:09:37,640
Guess I'll take it.

4189
05:09:39,180 --> 05:09:45,220
While we're clearing the air, I hope that I can be forgiven
for not doing more when the Hellwalkers attacked.

4190
05:09:46,340 --> 05:09:51,220
Whatever reservations I have about violence, they shouldn't
apply when your home is under attack.

4191
05:09:52,040 --> 05:09:53,800
And certainly not by undead abomination.

4192
05:09:53,960 --> 05:09:54,920
He's at the old house?

4193
05:09:55,100 --> 05:09:55,800
God damn it!

4194
05:09:55,840 --> 05:09:57,480
I reached for a shield instead of a sword.

4195
05:09:58,160 --> 05:10:00,540
You are right to chide me for that, old friend.

4196
05:10:01,880 --> 05:10:03,940
Why are we always going back to the wrong house?

4197
05:10:04,440 --> 05:10:05,040
I'll be ready.

4198
05:10:06,000 --> 05:10:06,720
Well said, Tia.

4199
05:10:07,420 --> 05:10:08,600
I believe you just might.

4200
05:10:10,220 --> 05:10:10,780
Oh, yeah, sure.

4201
05:10:10,880 --> 05:10:11,800
He did grab a shield.

4202
05:10:12,700 --> 05:10:15,560
He's like, he's like, don't worry, guys, I'm here.

4203
05:10:15,820 --> 05:10:17,380
I'm just going to keep working on this till you're ready to
head out.

4204
05:10:20,060 --> 05:10:21,260
Can't believe it.

4205
05:10:22,360 --> 05:10:24,760
My dog is also at the wrong house.

4206
05:10:26,140 --> 05:10:27,180
He wouldn't fit there.

4207
05:10:27,180 --> 05:10:28,100
We can put him outside.

4208
05:10:28,120 --> 05:10:30,220
I think I need to clear my head.

4209
05:10:30,280 --> 05:10:31,160
I don't know that.

4210
05:10:32,040 --> 05:10:34,000
You can fit outside the house.

4211
05:10:35,800 --> 05:10:36,520
Thank you.

4212
05:10:38,940 --> 05:10:40,020
Alright, let's see.

4213
05:10:40,140 --> 05:10:41,480
Oh, another upgrade.

4214
05:10:43,000 --> 05:10:45,320
Keep her sharp and she'll keep you alive.

4215
05:10:46,240 --> 05:10:47,860
Oh, and I have an upgrade for this too?

4216
05:10:48,600 --> 05:10:49,000
Ooh.

4217
05:10:51,180 --> 05:10:51,720
Nice.

4218
05:10:55,060 --> 05:10:57,120
Okay, that's all the upgrades I have.

4219
05:11:00,820 --> 05:11:01,300
Uh...

4220
05:11:01,300 --> 05:11:03,620
Defense is lower.

4221
05:11:06,040 --> 05:11:06,520
Vitality.

4222
05:11:07,580 --> 05:11:09,220
I don't know if I like that.

4223
05:11:09,960 --> 05:11:11,680
I'm gonna keep my current stuff then.

4224
05:11:11,720 --> 05:11:16,800
Before we check on Freya, is there any unfinished business
in other realms you want to take care of?

4225
05:11:17,300 --> 05:11:19,140
I'm sure the lad would love to help.

4226
05:11:19,180 --> 05:11:19,840
No, that's okay.

4227
05:11:20,040 --> 05:11:20,200
Wait.

4228
05:11:20,680 --> 05:11:22,120
We're with you.

4229
05:11:28,970 --> 05:11:29,810
Like, nope.

4230
05:11:37,400 --> 05:11:38,040
All right.

4231
05:11:41,340 --> 05:11:42,020
We're good.

4232
05:11:45,340 --> 05:11:46,880
Off to Vanaheim.

4233
05:11:50,290 --> 05:11:51,350
Where is it?

4234
05:11:52,070 --> 05:11:53,110
I just had to go here.

4235
05:11:53,370 --> 05:11:54,010
Freya's camp?

4236
05:11:54,610 --> 05:11:55,750
We traveled to Vanaheim.

4237
05:11:56,210 --> 05:11:56,350
Great.

4238
05:11:56,890 --> 05:11:57,890
You gonna check in on Freya?

4239
05:11:58,430 --> 05:12:00,210
Oh my god, I saw the dog.

4240
05:12:01,650 --> 05:12:03,290
I should have fucking went to the dog.

4241
05:12:04,330 --> 05:12:05,010
Oh shit.

4242
05:12:05,110 --> 05:12:06,710
So what happened the last time you were in Vanahe?

4243
05:12:07,310 --> 05:12:07,590
Wait.

4244
05:12:07,810 --> 05:12:10,070
I still don't know how you got Frey to stop trying to kill
you.

4245
05:12:10,590 --> 05:12:12,830
We traveled to her village to break Odin's spell.

4246
05:12:13,410 --> 05:12:16,110
Once freed, she accepted that I was not her enemy.

4247
05:12:16,490 --> 05:12:20,810
You also missed a highly entertaining moment where Brock was
lifted ass over face and Frey's down.

4248
05:12:20,810 --> 05:12:22,030
Oh yeah, I could go back, right?

4249
05:12:22,890 --> 05:12:23,730
What's he like?

4250
05:12:24,230 --> 05:12:25,390
Different from his sister.

4251
05:12:26,050 --> 05:12:26,890
Lacks her conviction.

4252
05:12:27,350 --> 05:12:27,590
True.

4253
05:12:28,250 --> 05:12:29,630
But he's a bit quicker to forgive.

4254
05:12:29,910 --> 05:12:30,890
I don't want to go back.

4255
05:12:31,750 --> 05:12:32,130
In effect.

4256
05:12:35,800 --> 05:12:36,320
Good leader.

4257
05:12:36,840 --> 05:12:38,060

05:16:03,560 --> 05:16:03,780
Alright.

4291
05:16:04,220 --> 05:16:06,400
I think this is a good time to stop here.

4292
05:16:07,520 --> 05:16:09,260
How much progress did we make?

4293
05:16:09,600 --> 05:16:11,360
Like, where are we at right now, chat?

4294
05:16:13,580 --> 05:16:15,660
Ring cam in all nine realms.

4295
05:16:18,520 --> 05:16:19,640
75% done.

4296
05:16:19,720 --> 05:16:21,200
Do you think I can finish it next stream?

4297
05:16:22,180 --> 05:16:22,180
Guys?

4298
05:16:22,880 --> 05:16:25,400
How much more of the gameplay do we have left?

4299
05:16:26,120 --> 05:16:27,860
Like, hours left!

4300
05:16:28,700 --> 05:16:31,820
I don't know if I can play eight hours.

4301
05:16:33,440 --> 05:16:34,300
75%?

4302
05:16:34,400 --> 05:16:37,820
I mean, 75% is pretty good progress.

4303
05:16:38,040 --> 05:16:39,880
I did not think we were getting actually closer.

4304
05:16:40,300 --> 05:16:41,340
Maybe two streams?

4305
05:16:42,420 --> 05:16:43,300
Oh, man.

4306
05:16:43,480 --> 05:16:45,840
Do you think I can take eight hours?

4307
05:16:46,060 --> 05:16:46,340
Ooh.

4308
05:16:47,920 --> 05:16:50,320
Like, Like, one, maybe two streams.

4309
05:16:51,680 --> 05:16:55,420
I'll try one stream and then we'll see how far it goes.

4310
05:16:56,240 --> 05:16:56,700
Maybe.

4311
05:16:57,900 --> 05:16:58,140
I'll see.

4312
05:16:58,320 --> 05:17:03,280
I'll schedule one stream for it and then, like, um, and then
we'll see how that goes.

4313
05:17:03,420 --> 05:17:06,300
But I'm definitely enjoying this game a lot.

4314
05:17:06,740 --> 05:17:09,360
Um, I love, I really love how the story is progressing.

4315
05:17:09,540 --> 05:17:11,520
And I think it's so well-written, honestly.

4316
05:17:11,900 --> 05:17:13,600
And, like, it feels so real.

4317
05:17:13,640 --> 05:17:16,260
Like, some of the dialogue is so well-written.

4318
05:17:16,500 --> 05:17:18,200
And, like, it feels like...

4319
05:17:18,500 --> 05:17:25,000
actual like the the interactions and the voice acting is
just so so really good like everybody too like when we were
