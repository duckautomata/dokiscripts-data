1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
But like, just to be safe, and I don't want to get famine in trouble, I'll try to censor myself.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,000
But yeah, it's really great to see all of you guys.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
I am quite hyped up in caffeine right now.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,080
Because it's going to be a very long day.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,700
If you guys didn't know my schedule, it was really like...

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,620
It was really like, I had a 10 a.m.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,020
tech check, and then obviously paddle, which is right now.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:35,140
And then right after this panel ends, I have to go straight to Twitch to stream the Mama Rylos Early Access.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,140
Because it starts exactly at 2.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,120
And then right after that, I have to tech check for the meet and greet.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,740
And then right after that, it's the meet and greet.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,220
So it's a very long day for me.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,540
Go, go get it!

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:01:02,020
And then the worst part was that my dog, Dad, Doki Amber Doge, yes, for those who don't know, my dog's name is Dad, because his name is also Doki.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,180
Yes, I named him after myself because I'm an egomaniac.

16
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,700
So I call him Dad for Doki Amber Doge, just to differentiate between Doki Bird and Doki Doge.

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:23,900
But anyway, this piece of shit was at 5 in the morning, and it continued to wake me up every hour.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,760
So it was like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and I'm like, what do you want?

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:43,140
And then, so, I was like, please, because, like, I think he realized that, like, the last time he gave up, but then now, I think it's because he's getting better now, because he was recovering from surgery a month ago.

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,560
So, like, every day he gets stronger, and then every day he's realizing, wait, you're the bitch.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:59,600
Like, so, he's like, every day he's like, this is it, I know, I know you will listen to me eventually.

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,220
And he was right, because at 9 in the morning, I eventually got up, because I was like, I can't.

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:16,300
He's, every hour, you're just gonna wake me up, I will do your walkies, feed you, and then I know I can't sleep anywhere, because I have to do the tech check at 10 in the morning.

24
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,120
So, that's why I'm, like, super hyped up on caffeine right now, because I need it to survive the rest of the day.

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,220
But, yes, anyway, I know you guys are here to ask me questions, so I guess it's time to bring you guys in.

26
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,580
So, I believe you can start lining up if you want to, and let's get the Q&A started.

27
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm looking forward to talking to you guys.

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
Can you hold this?

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,740
Also, yeah, for those who don't know, I did shadow drop the FNAF 3D cover, so you guys want to see.

30
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,700
And so many people were like, why did she upload the 3D cover out of nowhere?

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,700
Because I literally got it this morning, and I was like, why not?

32
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,560
It was like, I was like, yeah, might as well put it up.

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,900
Okay, question, question.

34
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,500
Hi, Donkey.

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
Long time to be here.

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,640
My question is, will you ever use Doki Field again?

37
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,440
Doki Field?

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,280
Doki Field?

39
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,580
Okay, the reason why I don't use, I use him once.

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,700
Like I say him.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,320
I use Doki Field once.

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,800
It's because it is a lot of work to set up.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,880
Because that skin suit is on an entirely different program.

44
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,100
And it's like, I don't know, I don't even remember what program it was, but it was on an entirely different program.

45
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,660
And it doesn't use, like, phone, it uses, like, a webcam.

46
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,380
And I was like, I can't, because the thing is, my webcam cable is too short.

47
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,300
Because my monitor is too high.

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,880
So, like, it cannot reach the top of the monitor.

49
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,700
So, I had to, like, MacGyver my way to put the webcam somewhere.

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,640
So, like, I really had to stack books and stuff just to place the webcam and just to make it work.

51
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,300
And so, like, after that, I just got really lazy.

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,200
Because I was like, well, I can't be bothered stacking stuff again.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,140
But, like, maybe whenever I get not lazy, so, like, maybe next year, when I'm not as lazy.

54
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,700
But I would love to use that skin suit again in the future.

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,180
Like I said, it's mostly because of my own laziness.

56
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,160
Because, like, usually when I start streaming, I prep.

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,220
I think you guys all know, I set up, like, five minutes before I stream.

58
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:52,580
And so, so, it's like, maybe when I don't do that, I can set up Doke Field again.

59
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,900
But, yeah, I hope that answers your question.

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you.

61
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,960
Good luck with the game later.

62
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,460
Oh, thank you.

63
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,180
Hello, hello.

64
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,260
Hello, Doki.

65
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
So, my question is, do you plan to do another WrestleTuber this year?

66
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,760
Oh, my gosh.

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
I know a lot of people have asked me that.

68
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,740
Yes, I am planning on doing it again this year.

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,880
The reason why, I've not planned it at all, so you don't expect it soon.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,500
But, I've been very, very busy this year in general.

71
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,340
So, I haven't had the time to actually plan it through.

72
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,140
And that's why, like, it's been, like, on a hiatus for now.

73
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,900
I mean, it will come back eventually this year.

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,580
Because, like, I'm not going to, like, make you guys wait until, like, next year or anything.

75
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,700
But, like, for now, like, it's still, like, in hibernation.

76
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,440
And to, like, all the other stuff that I have going on.

77
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
There's so many things going on behind the scenes.

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,040
Like, that's why I'm, like, all over the place.

79
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,020
I mean, like, I haven't had a new outfit in more than a year now, guys.

80
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,740
So, why don't you think about that?

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,620
So, I have a lot of other stuff lined up.

82
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,220
So, that's why the WrestleTuber thing has been on hiatus for now.

83
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,700
But it will come back this year.

84
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,900
Just not in the next, like, couple of months.

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
Or, like, two or three months, maybe.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
All right.

87
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,560
Thank you.

88
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,100
Yeah, no problem.

89
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:17,850
Hey.

90
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,090
Sorry, I forgot my words for a moment.

91
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,070
What are some general lives goals that you have before starting a stream?

92
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,890
Like, can you repeat that?

93
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,850
What are some general lives goals that you have before you start a stream?

94
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,510
One of my general life goals before I start, before I became a streamer?

95
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,490
No, like, generalize with an I-Z-E.

96
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,370
Wait.

97
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,110
Sorry, I'm a little slow right now.

98
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,890
The screen is, like, not working 3D.

99
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,490
No worries.

100
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,250
Generalize?

101
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,050
Lize?

102
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,470
Generalized.

103
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,790
Like, generalized.

104
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,010
Generalized.

105
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,110
Generalized.

106
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:57,930
Just general.

107
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,530
Just general.

108
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:58,830
General.

109
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,930
Why am I so confused?

110
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:10,050
I can't, I can't figure out what you said.

111
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,930
General what?

112
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,510
Generalized.

113
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,310
Generalized.

114
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,270
Generalized.

115
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,270
Wait.

116
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,270
Can my, can my staff pick up what the general what?

117
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,510
Oh, my God.

118
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,110
I can't, for some reason, I don't know why I can't comprehend it.

119
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,290
General what?

120
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,370
No, that's Jim Dean on the desk, bro.

121
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,730
That's Jim Dean on the desk.

122
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,510
Wait, General, no one's cutting in and out.

123
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,510
I can't hear it.

124
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,630
Wait, spell it out.

125
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,730
G-E-N-E-R-A-L-I-Z-A-D.

126
00:07:49,730 --> 00:08:01,090
G-E-N-E-R-A-L-I-Z-A-D.

127
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,370
General.

128
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,230
Gen-E-I-D.

129
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,110
Generalized.

130
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,890
Oh, generalized.

131
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:40,650
What are some generalized goals that you have before starting the stream?

132
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,190
Ah, okay.

133
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,410
I don't know why I couldn't understand that question for the longest time.

134
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,450
I told you guys, today I'm really slow today.

135
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,670
My mind has not been okay.

136
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,850
Waking up at five in the morning is not great for me.

137
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,010
Who would have thought?

138
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,350
Okay, my generalized goals.

139
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,950
Okay, so before I start streaming, I actually just go in head empty.

140
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:13,670
Like, I go in and be like, alright, gotta stream this today.

141
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,110
And then I just go in.

142
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,410
Whatever happens, happens.

143
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,950
Like, I don't have a set plan when I stream.

144
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,770
It's just mostly... I think that's why people are like, oh, we can never...

145
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,230
Like, you don't know what to expect in a dealkeeper's stream.

146
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,610
That's correct, because I don't know what to expect either.

147
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,470
So I go in and just say whatever is in my mind, like, just right off the bat.

148
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,750
But I do try to censor myself, because I was like, YouTube terms of services.

149
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:47,230
So I just make sure I don't breach any TOS lining there.

150
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,290
And then, you know, so like, but I do...

151
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,570
Like, I just literally just be like, something, some random ass thought pops up in my head, and then I just say it.

152
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:04,790
But yeah, like, as long as you Dragoons have a good time, enjoy yourself, and I have fun, that's all that matters to me.

153
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,010
So yeah, that's really it.

154
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,170
There's really no goals I set up for myself.

155
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,070
I just go straight in.

156
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,070
I think it's because I've been doing this for so long, that like, for me, it's just like...

157
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,370
I don't want to say autopilot, because like, I still am aware of what I'm doing.

158
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,270
But like, it's just more self-experience-wise, because you do it so often.

159
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,130
Like, it's just, you turn on the stream, and then you just go.

160
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,050
Like, that's it.

161
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:37,050
You just go until you're tired, or you finish the game, or like, something incredibly frustrating happens that you crash out, and then you just leave.

162
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,770
Like, that's really it.

163
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,330
But yes, thank you for the question.

164
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,030
I'm sorry, I don't know why I forgot what generalize means.

165
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,090
No worries.

166
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,780
Just to preface this question, you know what general...

167
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,040
Sorry.

168
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,880
You know what consultation work is, right?

169
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,220
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,160
Don't worry, I know my words, guys.

171
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,420
English is my first language, don't worry.

172
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,380
So, um...

173
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:27,180
As a pro gamer, and as a community figure, if a game studio ever approached you for general consultation work, would you ever consider doing it?

174
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,360
Well, if I get paid.

175
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,940
Like...

176
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,100
Like...

177
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,280
I was like...

178
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,320
I was saying this, I don't have a lot of time.

179
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,040
So, it's worse though, like...

180
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,340
It's really hard to, like, if someone wants, like, you know...

181
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,940
I guess, like, want me to do it for free.

182
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,020
Um, it's most likely no, because I don't have a lot of time in general.

183
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,440
Um, and, um...

184
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,420
So, like, my schedule...

185
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,180
Like, you said, like, you know, like, today, it's like...

186
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,120
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

187
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,500
Boom.

188
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,260
And so, it's more likely that I will do it, if it's like, you know, it's like a paid work type of deal.

189
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,760
So, um...

190
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,920
I mean, it's very interesting.

191
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
But like I said, like, there's not...

192
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
I don't really have a lot of free time these days.

193
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,620
Especially, like, um...

194
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,660
There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes in general for me.

195
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,860
So, I would love to have the opportunity.

196
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,860
But like I said, I don't...

197
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,320
I can't really do it for free type deal.

198
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,940
Uh, so, but yeah.

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,860
Thank you for the question.

200
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:21,660
Yeah.

201
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,500
Uh, just a quick addendum.

202
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,020
Uh, the...

203
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah, the exposure, like, say, from, like, Marvel Rivals or Apex.

204
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,600
What do you consider?

205
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,480
For Marvel Rivals or Apex?

206
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Yeah, we're approaching.

207
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,660
If they want my consultation on their game...

208
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,120
Um, first off, why are they asking my opinion on how to...

209
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,880
Like, I feel like...

210
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,660
Especially if I...

211
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,280
If I...

212
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,080
Okay, that's what scares me the most.

213
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,340
Cause it's like, if I give the wrong ideas on how to change a character...

214
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,800
I am gonna be like...

215
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,340
Like, people would send in hate crowds at me.

216
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,300
Because people would be like, How dare you ruin Jeff?

217
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,140
Or...

218
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,460
Like, how dare you break this game for us?

219
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,640
Why are they asking random VTubers on how to balance...

220
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,360
This game?

221
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Who is she?

222
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,820
Like...

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Like...

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,000
I saw, like, when they announced the people who were doing the early access...

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,140
I saw some people on the...

226
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,850
Comment section...

227
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,240
Be like...

228
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,780
Why are you letting these streamers play the game?

229
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,840
Like, play your game early access!

230
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,240
I was like, whoa, what?

231
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,940
And then...

232
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,700
And then...

233
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,040
Sprinkled in would be like...

234
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,760
People would be like...

235
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,680
You broke Jeff!

236
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,460
Fix Jeff!

237
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,500
And then...

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,600
Little do they know...

239
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,080
Okay, I'm gonna give you guys a little spoiler.

240
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,340
A little, like...

241
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,980
Two hour...

242
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,680
Like, one hour spoiler before I stream it.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,360
Jeff is like...

244
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,160
Broken...

245
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
But not for the reasons the general crowd thinks he's broken.

246
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,080
They think they destroyed Jeff as in he's unplayable right now.

247
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,180
But Jeff right now is incredibly broken.

248
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,680
Because I was testing it last night.

249
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,320
And...

250
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,340
It was crazy.

251
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,220
Because, like...

252
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,120
Okay, for those who speak Marvel Rivals.

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm sorry for those who don't speak Marvel Rivals.

254
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,760
And be like...

255
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,000
What the heck is she talking about?

256
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,880
But...

257
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,600
Um...

258
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,280
I figured out...

259
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
That, like...

260
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,540
When you...

261
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,420
In the Jeff vault, you eat somebody.

262
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,380
And then...

263
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,040
Obviously, the person takes damage in the Jeff vault.

264
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,740
And then...

265
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,820
But then when the storm picks you up...

266
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,600
The storm vault also kills the person in the Jeff vault.

267
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,940
So I was like...

268
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,720
Oh my god!

269
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,120
And then he's just dead.

270
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,920
You're just dead.

271
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,420
Like...

272
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,380
And then you can't kill Jeff because he's in the storm vault.

273
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,640
And she has 800 HP.

274
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,500
Um...

275
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,120
But you'll find that out in, like, 30 minutes.

276
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,100
Like...

277
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,960
He's gonna be, like, really broken for in 2...

278
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,380
Season 2.5.

279
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,500
And everybody's gonna play him.

280
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,200
Because I found out how broken he is.

281
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,780
Anyway...

282
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,140
Sorry.

283
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,940
But, like...

284
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,580
If I was...

285
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,020
If they asked me about the...

286
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,240
What it do for changes...

287
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,400
I'd be like...

288
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,480
I'd be like...

289
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,160
I don't know...

290
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,760
Make Luna...

291
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,560
Like...

292
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
Make Luna Snow have, like...

293
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,000
700 HP or something.

294
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,360
I don't know.

295
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,920
I don't know.

296
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,340
So...

297
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,400
Die won't kill her.

298
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,260
And then everyone's gonna hate me.

299
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:03,980
So, yeah.

300
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,320
No, I don't know why they'll ask me for my opinion.

301
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Thank you.

302
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,140
Yeah, no problem.

303
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,180
Hello.

304
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,100
Hello.

305
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,920
Hello.

306
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,220
I would have a curious question.

307
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,880
Um...

308
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,280
Are you open to collaborating with, like...

309
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,780
Smaller, on-the-rise...

310
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,460
YouTubers or streamers?

311
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,100
Or people that...

312
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,920
Are trying to get...

313
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,700
Trying to get more successful?

314
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,060
No?

315
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,800
Is that a curiosity?

316
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,860
Well, I wouldn't say I would randomly collab with people.

317
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,500
I would collab with people that I know and feel familiar with.

318
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,200
Um...

319
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,360
Because, like, you know, there's a lot of people in the VTuber community.

320
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,780
And, like, um...

321
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,640
I also want to know, like, if we have chemistry or if there are, like, people that...

322
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,100
Um...

323
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,000
That I would vibe with.

324
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,460
It's more so vibes for me.

325
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,080
Um...

326
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,600
Because I don't randomly just, like, collaborate...

327
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,580
Like, uh...

328
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,760
Right now, like, in my...

329
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,240
You guys might notice I haven't done a lot of collaboration recently.

330
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,360
But also it's because I've been, like, very busy with all the stuff that's going...

331
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,740
Coming up.

332
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,560
And a lot of the collaborations that I do is mostly me reaching out to people in general.

333
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,620
And then it's me thinking, like, what do my...

334
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,880
What do Dragoons want to see?

335
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,040
And, like, what kind of, like, connections or collaborations they want me to have?

336
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,880
So it's more so, like, that when I organize collabs.

337
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,820
It's more like, what do Dragoons want to see?

338
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,300
Who do they want me to interact with?

339
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,860
Do I think that this person I'm going to be interacting with have, like, good chemistry with me?

340
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,400
Because, you know, that's the scary part about collaborating with someone you don't know.

341
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,060
Um...

342
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,960
or you never talked to before in the past, is that you might not have a very good collab, because it might be very awkward.

343
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,520
Because that's always how things go sometimes.

344
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,900
Well, not always, but that's a little underlying fear for me.

345
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,720
Especially when I do these... Right now, I have the thing with other streamers, and a lot of these streamers, I have never interacted with before.

346
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,520
So it's always such an underlying fear for me, because I'm like, oh, I've never talked to these people before.

347
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,200
So it's very scary for me, and I get very anxious and stuff like that, especially when it's a huge group.

348
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,340
I don't mind if it's a group setting, more so, because then maybe I have someone that I do know in there, and then someone I don't know.

349
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:25,380
But it's not for a collab, it's not like... I pick who I want to, based off of if I think that we have good chemistry in the end.

350
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Like, if I would vibe with this person.

351
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
So it's not like, oh, I don't...

352
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,500
I have collabed with smaller VTubers or smaller content creators, but it's more so like I know that...

353
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,200
It's like people that I know that we would have good chemistry with, or good back and forth with in general.

354
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,920
So yeah, it's just that, really.

355
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,160
It's not like I don't just randomly be like, you, collab with me.

356
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,000
I also look into like, how we would interact.

357
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,360
Like, maybe.

358
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,060
How it would go.

359
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,060
Okay, thank you again.

360
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,820
Thank you so much.

361
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,700
Yeah, no problem.

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,260
Cool.

363
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,920
Hi, Doki.

364
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,540
My name's Corey.

365
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:15,340
So, uh, with, uh, Maid, Minthe, and being really good at singing and dancing, do you see yourself want to continue improving singing and your dancing?

366
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,360
Um, dancing is so hard, man.

367
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,020
I think, I remember.

368
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,620
Okay, like, Minthe, she's been doing this for years.

369
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,920
I don't know if you guys know that.

370
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,060
Like, she's been like dancing even before she was a VTuber.

371
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:38,740
And it's like, I, when I saw her dance in real life, um, like during a concert, it was like, it's crazy.

372
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,760
I was like, how do you do all that stuff with your body?

373
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,260
Like, how do you, how does it move like that?

374
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:54,660
Like, and then, like, I had to do, like, I don't remember how long I did dance classes for, but like, it was so hard.

375
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,680
It was so, so hard.

376
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,160
I remember I was just like, I don't know, I just know I was very, very tired.

377
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,000
Um, and my dances weren't even that difficult, too.

378
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,040
Like, compared to what she did.

379
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,940
Um, but like, ah, man.

380
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,700
Like, if I have to do, like, a concert again, or like anything related to dancing, I will have to do dance classes.

381
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,920
But I know that dancing, I definitely won't be doing it a lot.

382
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,100
It's only when I'm like, it's like a mandatory thing, you know?

383
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,640
Where it's like, oh, you have a concert soon, you gotta do choreo.

384
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,400
And I was like, alright, dance classes, here I come!

385
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,020
Singing-wise, ah, I've always, I wish I can, I wish I can sing.

386
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,500
Sometimes.

387
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,940
Cause like, um, singing is very, like for me, I'm not a natural singer.

388
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,100
Because I didn't grow up singing.

389
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,500
Um, instead I spent my days studying.

390
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,100
Like, uh, doing what my parents wanted me to do.

391
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,000
Locked up in their room and studied.

392
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:04,880
Um, and so like, I haven't had singing lessons in a long, long time.

393
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,040
It's more so like, time-wise too, I just don't have time.

394
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,380
And I do like, I would love to do, do more singing stuff.

395
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:22,280
Um, but it's also like, my biggest issue was that, I think you guys all know, I had voice, like, not voice issues, but like, I was sick for a long time.

396
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,640
I mean, I got sick for like, like continuously for a year.

397
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,800
So it was like, for those who don't remember, it's like, last year, it's like, I got sick.

398
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,680
And then for like, two months or some shit, and I was like, copying everything.

399
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,780
And then I got better.

400
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,240
And then I got sick again.

401
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,520
And then I got better.

402
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,040
And then I went to Japan, and I got sick.

403
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,460
And then I got better.

404
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,640
And then like, I got sick again.

405
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,860
And now I'm here.

406
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,020
I'm better now.

407
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,360
Um, so, my throat has not been okay for a year.

408
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,580
Um, so, um, let's hope I don't get sick again.

409
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,720
Because this is the, I feel like this is the longest I've been like, this is the longest I could breathe through my nose.

410
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:13,640
So, um, I do want to do more singing in the future, and like, maybe release more song covers.

411
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,920
And I do have like, some original songs in the works.

412
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,500
I just haven't recorded for them.

413
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,860
Because I had like, an original song finished.

414
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,280
Like, they made the lyrics and everything.

415
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,040
It was all finished.

416
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,060
It just needed me to record.

417
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,460
And then it's literally been sitting in the back corner for half a year.

418
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,500
Because I was not okay for half a year.

419
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,580
Like, I couldn't.

420
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,040
My throat was not okay for half a year.

421
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,780
So they've been like, waiting for me to record for the longest time.

422
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,220
I'm like, I'm sorry.

423
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,300
I just can't record.

424
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,180
Um, but whatever.

425
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,720
I would like to do it more in the future.

426
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,980
Thank you.

427
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,120
Yeah, no problem.

428
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,660
What's up, Doki?

429
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,120
What's up?

430
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,160
Eh!

431
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,320
That's not my question.

432
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,680
Don't worry.

433
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,980
Yeah, I was gonna say, leave.

434
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,220
Fine, jeez.

435
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:05,520
Okay.

436
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,580
Well, speaking of Marvel rivals, I'm a big fan of that.

437
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,740
So it's important that I get your opinion on this.

438
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,420
Mm-hmm.

439
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,580
What are your opinions on the balance changes?

440
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,800
And on top of that, do you think we should nerf Adam Warlock's movement?

441
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,020
Oh.

442
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,020
Oh my god.

443
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,760
You wanna...

444
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,700
You wanna break his legs again?

445
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,240
Like...

446
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,340
Yeah!

447
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,000
Screw that guy!

448
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,420
The guy's been through some...

449
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,060
Bored again!

450
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,380
Yeah, no, I don't want that.

451
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,520
You wanna break his legs.

452
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,600
Um, he had one...

453
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,680
He had half a season to walk again.

454
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,840
And you already wanna break his legs.

455
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,520
Okay.

456
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,320
Well, um, you guys didn't know.

457
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,800
Um, Hawkeye can shoot through walls now, so...

458
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,040
So...

459
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,680
I didn't know about that.

460
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:48,820
What?

461
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,880
I...

462
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,420
You're like, oh...

463
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,940
You're gonna find out in, like, 30 minutes.

464
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:01,940
Um, I don't know if that was in the patch notes, but I was testing it out, and Hawkeye was literally...

465
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,220
I was like, you know...

466
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,720
Oh yeah, and the further you are, the more damage it does, and there's no...

467
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,340
There's no really falloff for his, like, freeze in air or whatever, because of this new Luna-Snow team-up.

468
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,660
But yeah, I literally can shoot...

469
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,080
You can shoot through multiple walls, too, by the way.

470
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,260
So, there's that.

471
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,480
Yeah, Hawkeye is really scary now.

472
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,140
Um...

473
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,920
Other than that, well...

474
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,540
I don't know.

475
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,940
It feels like...

476
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,500
It feels like it's gonna be very interesting, the new season.

477
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,340
Season 2.5.

478
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,080
Ultron was really fun when I was testing Ultron up.

479
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,220
It was really fun.

480
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,980
But, like, every DPS player is gonna try and play him.

481
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,620
Um...

482
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,880
Because he doesn't...

483
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,640
His left click is heal.

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,380
It's not heal.

485
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,280
It's damage.

486
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
It's only damage.

487
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,000
His...

488
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
His aiming mechanic is all damage.

489
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,000
And his only heal is, like, an ability.

490
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,800
So...

491
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,460
So, it was very interesting to play.

492
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,480
By the way, guys.

493
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,220
I finally finded my descent key on flying characters.

494
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:11,280
For those who don't know, I never had the ability to go down when I play flying characters.

495
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,200
Because I never needed to because I placed the point.

496
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,760
So, what I do when I play flying characters is that I look down.

497
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,600
So...

498
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,320
So...

499
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Obviously, that's not useful.

500
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,640
So, I have to finally find a key to actually go down when I play Ultron.

501
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm so proud of you.

502
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,800
When I play Ultron.

503
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,300
Um...

504
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,420
Uh...

505
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:32,700
But, yeah.

506
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,820
That's what I think about the current balance changes so far.

507
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:36,880
Um...

508
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
It's just very interesting.

509
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,160
I don't know if it'll make the game fun or make the game worse.

510
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,780
But as long as it kills dive, I'm happy.

511
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,260
Like, that's all I care about.

512
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,860
Thank you, Doki.

513
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,780
That was very informative.

514
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,780
Yeah, no problem.

515
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,640
You have a good one, alright?

516
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,960
Yeah, you too.

517
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,610
Howdy, Doki.

518
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,610
Hope you're doing good.

519
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,330
Howdy.

520
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,610
I got a glow stick in your color.

521
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,510
And...

522
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,630
Wow!

523
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,610
It has a mint inside of it.

524
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,430
That's, uh...

525
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:06,890
Ooh!

526
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:07,850
Yeah.

527
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,490
And that does lead into the question.

528
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,270
Um...

529
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,570
I would dare say that mint is your best friend.

530
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,830
So, might as well ask a fun one.

531
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,650
What would you say is your favorite memory with Mint Fantome, either on stream or in real life?

532
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,050
Uh...

533
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,050
That's really difficult because, like, we've done so much stuff together.

534
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,610
So...

535
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,990
I guess, like...

536
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,290
Uh...

537
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,610
Oh, man.

538
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,450
That's so difficult.

539
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,270
We've done so many things together.

540
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,130
But favorite memory so far...

541
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,070
Oh, my gosh.

542
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,090
Uh...

543
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

544
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:42,930
There's so many!

545
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,750
There's so many fun memories we've had together.

546
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,190
So it's, like, really difficult.

547
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,930
So it's, like, really difficult.

548
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,930
Like, um...

549
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,750
I guess, like...

550
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,510
If I say recent...

551
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,530
I think, like, every time I hang out with Mint, it's, like, a fun time.

552
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,670
So, like...

553
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,210
That's why it's, like, really difficult to say what's, like, my favorite memory.

554
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,350
Like, the Visage thing was really fun when we did that collab together.

555
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,630
Um...

556
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,010
And then, you know, when we did, like, um...

557
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,190
Um...

558
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,370
Um...

559
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,270
When we hanged out in Japan, that was fun.

560
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,450
When we did the concert together, that was also really, really fun.

561
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:16,730
Um...

562
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,410
Like, so it's so difficult to just be, like, oh, pinpoint your favorite memory.

563
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:25,850
Because, like, every time I hang out with her, it's just been a good time.

564
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,010
So, uh...

565
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:27,630
It's very difficult.

566
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,430
Okay.

567
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,910
I mean, as long as you're having fun with her, I got a good answer.

568
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,350
All right.

569
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:34,810
Cool.

570
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,710
Thank you.

571
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,310
Yeah, no problem.

572
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,210
Uh, hi, yeah.

573
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,190
I just wanted to ask a hypothetical question.

574
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,770
So, I know you a little bit more from your Apex Legends scene, so this may pertain more towards those players.

575
00:26:51,410 --> 00:27:08,850
But, I just wanted to ask, hypothetically, if a pro player, let's say, maybe, oh, I don't know, IPN or Nocturnal, if they got bitten by a snake in, uh, very precarious positions, would you be willing to suck the poison out of them in order to save their lives?

576
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,150
Unfortunately, I didn't mean to suck them so clearly why don't they suck each other off, why don't they suck each other off, so why don't they suck each other off?

577
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,430
Aww.

578
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:30,610
There are several there, so like, well, they're just to help each other out, so they save both, both of their lives... and they don't have to owe each other a favor, because, you know, You know, they both save each other's lives.

579
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,210
So it's like a dumb deal.

580
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,390
And I can be in the corner watching again.

581
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,790
Hi.

582
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,990
Hey Adoki, my name is Duke.

583
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,370
Hey.

584
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,790
How you doing?

585
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,850
That's all my question.

586
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,190
Doing great.

587
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,110
What got you into FPS games like Apex Survivals?

588
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:02,010
Um, well, I just, I'm just a very competitive person in general.

589
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:07,630
I don't remember talking about this before, but like, basically, like, my very first shooter game was Splatoon.

590
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,010
And like, the adrenaline from Splatoon.

591
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,850
No, I think Splatoon is my most toxic era ever.

592
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,070
Because like, the reason being is that you can't talk to anyone.

593
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:19,530
You can't communicate with anything.

594
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,470
All you can say is, woohoo, and woo me.

595
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:29,570
Like, but that doesn't convey how you feel when your teammate messes up.

596
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,610
Like, like, what do you say?

597
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,410
You say, woo me.

598
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,550
But like, in your mind, inside of you, you're like, I hate you.

599
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,990
Like, you're a child too.

600
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,150
And you're like, woo me.

601
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,670
So it's like, I think, like, Splatoon cultivated the toxicity inside me.

602
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,530
I have slammed my controller before.

603
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,150
Like, actually, like, I wouldn't throw it on a ground.

604
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,290
There would be a box there.

605
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,290
And I would like, slam, I would throw my controller in a box.

606
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,430
So I wouldn't break my controller.

607
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,410
But I have got really toxic playing Splatoon.

608
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,350
But anyway, and then it was, like, Splatoon.

609
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,810
And then, you know, my friends would be like, oh, Overwatch.

610
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,630
Try Overwatch.

611
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,910
And then that's where I got into FPS gaming.

612
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,170
And it's basically just, like, the competitive nature of everything.

613
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,910
I've just, like, seen numbers go up.

614
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,190
And just, like, I want to be, like, you know, the best player and stuff like that.

615
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,810
It's just the adrenaline rush of, like, being good at a video game.

616
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,030
And, like, you know, trying to aim for a goal.

617
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,810
You know, like, oh, top 500 or something.

618
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,730
It's just such an adrenaline rush, just, like, getting there and everything.

619
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,670
And it's, like, an addiction.

620
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,930
Because you're, like, one more, you know.

621
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,310
One more game.

622
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,590
And then it'll be gone.

623
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,870
And then you're, like, you can't end on a loss, you know.

624
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,470
It's, like, an addiction.

625
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,670
Yeah, like, that's what, like, FPS does.

626
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,830
Like, shooter games and FPS does to me.

627
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,050
And that's why, like, I got really into it.

628
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,930
Like, I like how it makes it sound very, like, unhealthy.

629
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,230
Very unhealthy and not good for you.

630
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:08,270
But, like, that's what makes, like, shooter games, FPS competitive games, like, really fun for me in general.

631
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,910
Just because I love the rank experience.

632
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,230
I remember when Marvel Rivals first came out and I just did quick play.

633
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,930
And I was like, this game is not that fun.

634
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,290
Because I was just doing quick play.

635
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,450
Like, for the beta.

636
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,270
Because beta didn't have rank yet.

637
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,770
And I was like, oh, I don't know.

638
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,270
I don't seem to feel like it's going to be a game that I'm going to enjoy.

639
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,750
But, because I was just playing quick play.

640
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,930
And then rank came out.

641
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,110
And now look at me.

642
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,490
I have a problem.

643
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,470
I...

644
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,430
So, yeah, I hope that answers your question.

645
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,130
Yeah, no, I suck at FPS games.

646
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:37,910
I'm going to bet the games.

647
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,670
I'm going to bet the games.

648
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,070
Thank you.

649
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,670
Thank you so much.

650
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,450
Yeah, no problem.

651
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,270
Yeah, no problem.

652
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,250
Hello.

653
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,530
Hello.

654
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,570
Hey.

655
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:51,650
Long time here.

656
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,530
First time asker.

657
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,850
So I just got a really serious question for you.

658
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:55,970
Uh-huh.

659
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,450
How well did you sleep last night after the Simpsons hit the run stream?

660
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:00,970
Terribly.

661
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,310
Yeah.

662
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,770
Never going to touch your car again.

663
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,270
Terribly because, like, okay, right after...

664
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,170
You know, I thought I would be like, yay, it's over, I can have a good night's today.

665
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:21,490
But after, I got a message being like, make sure to download the game engine for the early access before tomorrow.

666
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,030
And I was like, aw, shit.

667
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,670
And then because of that, I had to test everything out.

668
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,210
And then I started going through everything.

669
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,650
So then I went to bed at, not really late, I went to bed at midnight or something.

670
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,070
So there was that.

671
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:44,950
And then, you know, this beautiful dog of mine started being like, feed me at five in the morning.

672
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,090
Which is weird because we're not off schedule.

673
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,390
Like, he's trying to make his own schedule right now.

674
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,430
Thinking I don't know what time it is.

675
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:04,330
So, he's like, maybe if I try and trick her and make her feed me early, then I can eat food earlier.

676
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,230
But I don't think he understands that I have a clock.

677
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,210
My phone tells me the time.

678
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:15,010
But anyway, he woke me up several times.

679
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,350
So, like, I am not okay.

680
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,470
Just can't catch a break, huh?

681
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,910
Well, he's got little rivals next.

682
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:20,910
Yay!

683
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,860
Hi there, Doki.

684
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,600
Nice to meet you.

685
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,420
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

686
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,260
Alright, this question is going to touch on your Three Kingdoms brain rod.

687
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,660
Are you ready?

688
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,180
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,980
Okay, if you were a faction leader in the Three Kingdoms, who would be your five Tiger Generals and your main concubine?

690
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,320
The main concubine?

691
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,140
Okay.

692
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,480
Okay, one of them will be Zhugok Lun, and then he's going to be the concubine.

693
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,300
I know he can do it.

694
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,420
And then, the second one...

695
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,640
Well, I don't want Simai because he'll just kill me in the end.

696
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,260
Like, he'll backstack me in the end.

697
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,360
And it's like, I don't think that's cool.

698
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,320
Just take over when you're dead.

699
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:13,780
It's fine.

700
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,660
I don't think... I don't know.

701
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,460
He's going to rename the kingdom.

702
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,380
It'll be like, yay, the Joki Dynasty.

703
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,700
And then he's going to kill me.

704
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,380
He's like, okay, but what if it's the Jin Dynasty?

705
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,120
So I don't like that.

706
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,480
So no Simai, even though he's like a really great strategist.

707
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,380
But like...

708
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,620
And then the four other ones.

709
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,040
And then Guanyin because he's literally the god of war.

710
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,340
Like, why would I say no to a god of war?

711
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,920
And then Zhang Liao because he's loyal as hell, too.

712
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,940
And he's very strong because he has beat my ass several times.

713
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,580
Daoyin because he's also loyal as hell, too.

714
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,760
And like, he is loved by... he's loved by Dynasty Warriors, so he'll get everything.

715
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,440
And that means I'll get everything.

716
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,240
And then the fifth one.

717
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,600
Ooh, that's difficult.

718
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
That's very difficult because I got all the good ones now.

719
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,160
I get Shao Jun because he's hot.

720
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,340
Yeah!

721
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:12,840
No!

722
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Eyepatch or no eyepatch?

723
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,100
Eyepatch.

724
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,020
That makes him hotter.

725
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,100
It's the eyepatch.

726
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,840
We all know.

727
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,780
Even if you're straight, you know he's pretty hot.

728
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,660
Okay, cool.

729
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,480
Thank you very much.

730
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Yeah, the eyepatch stays on.

731
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,100
We're going to do a group shot at the end.

732
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,100
Hello!

733
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,400
This is going to be a loud question, okay?

734
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,620
Oh, okay.

735
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,100
Yeah, sure.

736
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,120
Well, sorry, guys.

737
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,800
Yeah, you might.

738
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,660
One question for my noodle arm dosher.

739
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:52,060
So if you could keep only one model between Kroki and Doe Kitty, which one would it be in the model?

740
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,880
Wait, if I could what?

741
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,760
Only keep one model between Kroki...

742
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,040
Oh, if I could keep one model?

743
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,220
Oh, Kroki for sure.

744
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,220
Yeah, that's funny.

745
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,080
Yeah, that's funny.

746
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,740
For sure.

747
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,380
I would send Doe Kitty to the...

748
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,520
Like, Doe Kitty is your favorite.

749
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,500
It's the people's favorite.

750
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,020
I would send Doe Kitty to the farm with no hesitation.

751
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,280
Keep Kroki.

752
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,000
Kroki...

753
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,560
I think Kroki is basically...

754
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,640
If I was a tomato, Kroki would be, like, actually my inner self.

755
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,600
Like, I don't know.

756
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,220
I just fit...

757
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,680
I don't know why, but my voice just fits so well with Kroki.

758
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,320
Like, if I could just be an animal instead of, like, an anime girl, I would be a Kroki the entire time.

759
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,480
But if people be like, that's weird.

760
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,000
And I'm like, I'm not a furry.

761
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,940
I don't want to O.C.

762
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,500
a crown.

763
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,460
So then that's why I'm an anime girl.

764
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,580
Thank you.

765
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:49,920
All right.

766
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,560
No problem.

767
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,930
Junkie, do you have any last messages for them?

768
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,570
Oh, yeah.

769
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:58,890
All right.

770
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,590
Thank you, guys.

771
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,330
Oh, my gosh.

772
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,250
I already forgot you said this was the last question.

773
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,650
I was going to be like, wait, what?

774
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,690
But thank you, everybody, for coming to my panel.

775
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,770
So it truly is a great honor to be Fatima's first YouTuber guest of honor.

776
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,050
And it's always great to talk to all my dragoons here.

777
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,330
Because it's like, you guys are real, you know?

778
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,390
It's like, oh, my God, you're actually here.

779
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,930
And, like, you're not, like, bots or something.

780
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,530
You're real people.

781
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,230
Oh, my gosh.

782
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,230
And I always love doing these conventions and talking to all you guys.

783
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:34,050
It's like, you know, it's a little private, like, back to the honor chatting stream with you guys.

784
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,750
So it's such a fun experience.

785
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,110
And that's why I do all these conventions and go around the world, meeting my dragoons.

786
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,610
Because it's always a great experience.

787
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,390
So thank you, everybody, for coming to my panel.
