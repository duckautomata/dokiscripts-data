1
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,640
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,660
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,600
Dewi and I were just talking about Roblox.

4
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, wait, wait, they can't hear you.

5
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,420
Wait, give me a sec.

6
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,180
I fucked up.

7
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,800
I forgot, because you know when your PC updates and then everything else gets fucked up?

8
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,160
Oh my God, wait.

10
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,580
Wait, did everything fuck?

11
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,080
Oh, wait, can you talk real quick?

12
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,300
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, anyway.

13
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,960
What were you saying about Roblox?

14
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, yeah, you were preparing.

15
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
Yeah, it was like 30 minutes before.

16
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,420
No, just kidding.

17
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,380
That's why we're late.

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I was in a Roblox game.

19
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,020
That's true, that's true.

20
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,800
It wasn't my fault.

21
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:47,520
It wasn't because I realized that, like, I was like, oh, shit, how do I boot up myself and the game at the same time?

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,000
No, but Doobie hasn't even played the squid game Roblox yet.

23
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,700
No, I haven't tried it.

24
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,880
Wait, what games have you been playing on Roblox?

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,160
Oh, it's this cake designer game.

26
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,100
A cake designer?

27
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,080
Is it like the dressing one?

28
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,660
Yeah, yeah, but it gets seven minutes instead of like five minutes.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,500
It's pretty hardcore.

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,500
Wait, have you seen the videos, though, of the squid game Roblox videos?

31
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,820
I've seen it before, but I don't know about, like, the videos.

32
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,440
Is it the one where it's like the Mona Lisa?

33
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,860
No.

34
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,780
Wait, you've never seen that?

35
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,640
No, I haven't.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,420
Oh, my God.

37
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,820
Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,560
Okay, sorry, guys.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,040
I need to show her the Mona Lisa.

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh, you're gonna send it to me?

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,720
I send this to my chat all the time because it's actually, it lives, like, word free in my head.

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,800
And it's, like, basically, like, you know how in Roblox, there's, like, you can do voice comms, but you have to send in your ideas.

43
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,040
And stuff to talk to people.

44
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,160
So, like, all these little kids are, like, role playing in squid game as if they're actually there.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,560
Nobody would watch the video.

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,080
Fuck you.

47
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,610
Oh, my God.

48
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,850
The Mona Lisa.

49
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,650
Wait, did you send it to me?

50
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:11,970
Let me see.

52
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,650
It's actually one of my favorite Roblox videos.

53
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,670
Oh, yes, by the way, FreeCurl is Doobie and she's part of the P faction.

54
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
The Mona Lisa!

55
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,520
No!

56
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,860
I love videos online where it's just random kids who are, they're just not being supervised and just yelling at the top of their lungs.

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,760
I was like, oh, my God, kids these days.

59
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,920
Oh, my God, they could be, like, actual actors.

60
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,020
Like, holy shit.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Where are these kids in GTARP?

62
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,560
They probably should not.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,380
They're gonna be future GTARP role players.

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,320
I could see a career.

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,800
I could see a GTA 6 when it comes out in 2027.

66
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,020
That's true.

67
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,020
That's true.

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,140
Oh, my gosh.

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
But yeah, I can't believe you never played the squid game Roblox.

70
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,120
It's actually, like, it's so fun.

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,020
It's, like, I was, like, playing because, like, you know how, like, the higher rank you are, the longer.

72
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,220
OK, so, like, the higher rank you are, the longer the queues get because there's less people and higher elo.

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:30,020
So, like, at one point I was in, like, a 20 minute queue to find a game in, like, the top 500.

74
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,380
So I was just pulling up Roblox and playing it on stream in between queues.

75
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,320
And I was just, like, I can't.

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,860
I have to play something.

77
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,500
Like, I'm not gonna stay here for 20 minutes.

78
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,540
Yeah, it has matchmaking.

79
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,160
That's insane.

80
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,920
Are you ready?

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,400
Are you ready?

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:50,880
Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,720
What do you mean?

84
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,500
What do you mean?

85
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,220
My chat was, like, telling me that there's one character that I'm gonna, like, not like from your character lineup.

86
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,260
I think, like, the top five that I play is Cloak and Dagger, Rocket.

87
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,120
Penny Parker, Namor, and Mantis.

88
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,640
Oh, you're a Rocket man.

89
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah, but he's fun.

90
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,880
He's really fun.

91
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,720
I think, like, Rocket, the higher you get, Rocket is, like, the character most people will yell at.

92
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,640
I mean, yeah.

93
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,560
I did see there was that one Grandmaster who got zero damage.

94
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,600
He got zero damage and got the GM.

95
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,720
And I was like, why?

96
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,540
You're not helping all these Raccoon players.

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,820
It's because, like, the reason why a lot of people hate Raccoon players right now is because, like, usually Raccoon players don't swap.

98
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,640
They're like, I only play Raccoon because, like, all they do is just, like, right-click and go, haha.

99
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,000
They're like, can someone please play Punisher?

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,740
And you're just like, please, like...

101
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,240
It's, like, in higher rank is three support.

102
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,520
Yeah, triple support.

103
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,960
So, like, it's so boring.

104
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,180
It's like, have you ever played Overwatch during the GOATS meta?

105
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,100
Yeah.

106
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,660
Yeah, it's basically that.

107
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,100
So, like, nothing dies.

108
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,040
Yeah.

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,380
It's like, oh, there's Luna's 12 seconds of not dying.

110
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,300
Oh, there's Mantis now.

111
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,900
Oh, now it's Cloak and Dagger.

112
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,100
Well, Luna got her ult back again.

113
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,880
Yeah, but don't people ban Luna at, like, higher ranks?

114
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:39,480
Yeah, they ban Luna, but instead of running Luna, they just run Cloak and Dagger, Mantis, and Invisible Woman, which is basically the same thing.

115
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
But they don't want Adam Warlock?

116
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
Well, it depends.

117
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:54,760
Unless, like, it depends, because, like, his heals are not that good and you rely on his res ability, but people would rather just go with, like, three Zenyatta trances, you know, for something to happen.

118
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,340
But it's so boring.

119
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:09,180
Honestly, it's, like, one of the worst, like, comps you can play, because I was like, you know, like, I played these games before for Overwatch, and then you're like, I don't want to do this again.

120
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:17,300
Isn't it good, like, if you're queuing with, like, a support main, too, and if you play support, then that means that, you know, you have a more likely chance of locking it in?

121
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah, at least, like, you know, you don't have to worry about, like, three support players on the same team, because you can play triple support!

122
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,900
It's great!

123
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:25,860
Yay!

124
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,680
That's, like, the one thing I wish there was, a role queue, but people are like, the game will die if there's a role queue, but then I'm so tired of bumping into other support players.

125
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,520
Like, I once had a game where I had, like, four support mains on my team, and I was just like, alright, I guess we lose.

126
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,320
Like, what do we do?

127
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,740
I find in, like, some ranked games I play, I definitely have to play tank, because there's really no tank players, at least in the lower ranks.

128
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,200
That's so true, that's so true.

129
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,980
Like, tank players are, like, such a rare species.

130
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:08,420
They're, like, because, like, you know, as a tank, all you do is just get fucking, like, walloped, and, like, you get beat up in the front line, and you're like, what do I do?

131
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,560
I always tell my chat, to be a tank player, you have to be a masochist.

132
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:25,800
Well, especially because they move so slow, that's what I don't like about playing tank, but I guess playing Penny Parker and Venom, to me, those are the only ones I can play, because the rest are just, like, feels so slow.

133
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,960
They're, like, chonky, they're, like, just built, like, absolute units, and you're just, like, walking up to them and just hoping something dies.

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,940
Alright, I'll queue this up.

135
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,200
The queues are so fast, too.

136
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,920
It's actually crazy.

137
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,300
Instantly, that's why I didn't queue chat, because I knew instantly we were going to get in a game.

138
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,840
Oh, yeah, wait, is the audio balance okay, chat?

139
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,520
Oh, yeah, guys, is the audio good between me?

140
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,160
Is the stream actually live, or what?

141
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,760
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,500
Yeah, Doobie's streaming, too, on Twitch right now.

143
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:06,320
But for those who are wondering why I'm number two JokeyBird fan, because someone stole number one JokeyBird fan, so I have to be number two.

144
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,720
That's to be expected.

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:20,560
No, the thing is, I stole it, but I had to rename it, because I was, like, I had to rename that account, and then, like, somebody re-stole the name, and so, like, I have to be number two now.

146
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,060
I can't believe it.

147
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,760
I stole it on my other alt account.

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,900
Oh, my God, you sniped it.

149
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,840
You sniped it.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Okay, I'll play.

151
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,740
What should I play?

152
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,840
You can play either a tank or a DPS.

153
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,920
Triple DPS works, too.

154
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,660
Okay, I guess I'll play Rocket, then, your favorite.

155
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,960
Oh, my God.

156
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,540
Well, if you're playing Rocket, I know what, I gotta play this guy.

157
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,160
I gotta play Punisher.

158
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:48,860
Oh, nice.

159
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,760
Yeah, we got infinite ammo.

160
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,440
When I say ammo, just drop down to infinite ammo.

161
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay.

162
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,920
Yeah, and I could be like...

163
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm good at taking instructions.

164
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,140
Okay.

165
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,380
I think I can do it.

166
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,220
That's right.

167
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,820
Let's get Doobie the GM.

168
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,700
Not today, though.

169
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,840
I would freaking die.

170
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,500
No.

171
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,320
Yeah, it'd take too long.

172
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,840
I don't think I can do all the way to GM.

173
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,760
Oh, wait, my...

174
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,340
Alright, I'm not gonna be moving for a sec.

175
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,660
I'm gonna be throwing a little bit because I need to change the color crosshair.

176
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,540
Wait, why is it not green?

177
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,160
Okay, whatever.

178
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,660
I don't need green.

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,960
I can shoot with the white one.

180
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
Okay, it's been a while since I played Punisher, so I don't know what I'm doing.

181
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,420
Okay, I know what I'm doing.

182
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,100
Okay, I'm gonna walk up.

183
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,140
Can you give me ammo here?

184
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,620
Okay.

185
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,740
Okay.

186
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,620
Okay, I did a lot of damage.

187
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh, my God.

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
Oh, my God.

189
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,280
Oh, my God.

190
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,580
Easy.

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,500
That was low.

192
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Alright.

193
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,520
Oh, okay, I'm dead.

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,620
I did a lot.

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,220
Oh, I was not.

196
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,220
I forgot how fucking strong infinite was.

197
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,640
My settings are all so messed up.

198
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,260
Oh, no.

199
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,740
It's okay.

200
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,480
It's alright.

201
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,260
We can slowly fix it.

202
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,940
It's gold, like, it's alright.

203
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,540
We can go AFK until the last minute and then we'll just...

204
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,220
We can get your ELO back easily.

205
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,560
Oh, we're running triple support.

206
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,880
Wait, how are we dying?

207
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,660
Alright.

208
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Don't worry, we got a pick.

209
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
Alright, I'm coming over.

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,580
I have, like, 300 ziplines.

211
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,840
Because I keep forgetting to use my old ones.

212
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,400
Alright, I'm ready.

213
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,300
You can have infinite for me.

214
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,460
Okay.

215
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,740
Alright, yep.

216
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,660
Okay, nice, nice.

217
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,580
I need heals real fast.

218
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,940
Okay, I'm gonna ult here, but you're gonna have to team me up, though.

219
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280
Because I'll die.

220
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
No, I don't have enough healing as Rocket.

221
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,640
It's not just your job, though.

222
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,580
So, like, I'm a little...

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,600
Alright, I might be feeding a little.

224
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,940
I'll go Bucky.

225
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,480
It's okay.

226
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,100
I'll play Minim.

227
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:13,860
Alright.

228
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,720
Oh, if you're gonna play Venom, I don't need to play it.

229
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,940
I may or may not be feeding a little bit.

230
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,640
I keep thinking I'd live forever for some reason.

231
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
It's weird.

232
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,580
I don't know why.

233
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,820
I'm like...

234
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,800
Oh my god, I'll...

235
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
Okay, I...

236
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,820
I went into a...

237
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,180
I haven't played against...

238
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,980
Yeah, I haven't played against a Penny mine.

239
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,460
It's Penny and Solon.

240
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,740
Because Penny isn't meta.

241
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,360
So, like, nobody plays Penny.

242
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,760
So, I'm like, I can walk this, right?

243
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,020
Yeah.

244
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,240
Okay, okay, okay.

245
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,220
Nobody plays Penny, like, a higher rank?

246
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
No, no, she's a throw and higher ELO.

247
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,660
Because, like, Mag...

248
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:56,900
Mag...

249
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,740
Mag is strange and...

250
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,940
Who's the third thing?

251
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,960
Hulk is just so much better.

252
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,880
Oh, yeah.

253
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,740
They're just a lot better, so people don't usually play...

254
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,560
Alright.

255
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:12,960
Let's see.

256
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,700
I'll flank.

257
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,300
I'm gonna wait until...

258
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,160
Oh, there's the Hulk.

259
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:19,900
Oh.

260
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,240
We got this.

261
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,940
Oh my god.

262
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,640
Do we do?

263
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,220
It's okay, it's okay.

264
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,740
We got this.

265
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,180
I believe.

266
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,180
I believe.

267
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,300
Whoa, what the fuck?

268
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,140
Where's our other healer?

269
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:31,840
I don't know.

270
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,900
That's how I felt the entire time.

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,080
I'm like, where is her?

272
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,280
I feel like...

273
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,260
I feel like you were the only one that's been healing me.

274
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,500
Oh my god.

275
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,140
Oh, she's back.

276
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,080
I think she was AFK, the invisible woman.

277
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,520
Oh my god.

278
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,140
Yeah, or...

279
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,080
I don't trust her other healer.

280
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,780
Only 30 seconds.

281
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,480
I have another ult.

282
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,080
Okay, don't worry.

283
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,880
Our Loki is gonna do something amazing.

284
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,180
I believe in him.

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,180
I'm gonna be very curious as to what the...

286
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,600
What the heal stats are.

287
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,920
I'm not actually...

288
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,060
Alright, Loki, Loki.

289
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,580
This is it.

290
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,460
This is your time to shine, Loki.

291
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,280
This is it.

292
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,160
This is your time to shine, Loki.

293
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,440
Use your one ult.

294
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,540
This is it.

295
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,760
Okay, that's not point, but that's okay.

296
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,300
That's okay.

297
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,780
I'm totally gonna get healed, right?

298
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,640
I got messed up by the...

299
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,240
Wait, our Loki still hasn't ulted?

300
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,960
Our Loki never ulted.

301
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,320
This is just our warm-up game.

302
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,540
Yeah, guys, this is it.

303
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,460
This is just...

304
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,180
This is just...

305
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,720
This is just a warm-up, guys.

306
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,690
Like, we just...

307
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,400
Yeah, I don't think I've ever saw a Loki ult at all.

308
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,020
Holy shit.

309
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,160
It's alright.

310
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,160
It's alright.

311
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:52,900
I think...

312
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,580
Oh, man.

313
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,160
The support players are like...

314
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,260
Clearly, the DPS is the problem.

315
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,740
I think the other supports are like...

316
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,680
And I'm like, no.

317
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,760
No, it's definitely not.

318
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,700
Yeah, I didn't...

319
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,000
I barely got any healing from the...

320
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,900
Yeah, no, me too.

321
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,740
You were the only one that healed me, and I was just like...

322
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh, that's...

323
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,320
That's awkward.

324
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,260
Maybe I should've just gone back to play Cloak and Dagger or something to keep us up.

325
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,420
Luna Snowgill, back I go.

326
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,280
Oh, my God.

327
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,020
I know I was definitely feeding, but then I was like...

328
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,880
Trying to adjust playing DPS again.

329
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,740
That's what we're doing.

330
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,100
We were playing on alt accounts, and we had to adjust the settings.

331
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:37,740
Yeah, yeah, guys.

332
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,640
We were adjusting settings mid-game, and like...

333
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,820
I was in Luna Snowgill for so long, guys.

334
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,740
Like, you know, it takes me a while to...

335
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,120
Back up and hit them from far...

336
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,520
What?

337
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,500
No.

338
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,880
Alright.

339
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
I totally...

340
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,280
I believe in my...

341
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,220
I'll just put it on you, so...

342
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,380
You'll never die, Freecloak.

343
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,220
Oh, thank you.

344
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,980
You'll never die.

345
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
If you die, it's not because of me.

346
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,740
It's because they just...

347
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:10,980
It's because of Jeff.

348
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,520
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,720
It's because of Jeff, obviously.

350
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,640
Alright.

351
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,740
I mean, Jeff works...

352
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,540
Oh, there's a portal.

353
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,200
Oh, my God.

354
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,260
They're doing real strats.

355
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,980
Oh, my God.

356
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,560
No way.

357
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,640
My mines were placed perfectly.

358
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,420
What is this goo that's on the ground?

359
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,140
Who does that?

360
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,780
Where's the goo?

361
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,480
The blue goo sometimes.

362
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,240
The blue goo?

363
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,240
Is that the penny?

364
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,880
Enemy penny?

365
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,760
I don't know.

366
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,640
I don't think I see any blue goo.

367
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,100
Okay, I just missed like three shots, but that's okay.

368
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,760
A freaking mantis.

369
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh, my God.

370
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,440
This mantis is actually really good.

371
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,520
She's like...

372
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,240
She could actually aim, which is crazy.

373
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,680
It's very surprising.

374
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,340
That the mantis could aim.

375
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,240
Oh.

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,360
Look at that.

377
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,900
We did it.

378
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,780
They don't realize I'm sitting up here, which is...

379
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,220
Maybe.

380
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,040
Yeah, we're all on alt accounts, by the way.

381
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,800
Me and Doobie.

382
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,820
We're all on alt accounts, so we're just fighting other smurfs, guys.

383
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,520
Yeah, somebody asked what rank we are.

384
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm grandmaster in my heart.

385
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,260
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,560
I'm like one above all right now.

387
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,740
That's like top 500, kind of, right?

388
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,380
Oh, my God.

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,880
Loki broke my fucking hull.

390
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
My building.

391
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,720
Oh, wow.

392
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,400
This Loki actually uses ult.

393
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
That's actually crazy.

394
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,600
Careful.

395
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,960
You might die here.

396
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,900
Don't peek.

397
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,720
You can die too.

398
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,440
I'll punish ult.

399
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,580
You stupid punisher.

400
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,060
That's all right.

401
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,320
Wow.

402
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,500
It's actually crazy what happens when you have a healer that can heal.

403
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,680
We're doing okay.

404
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,300
We're doing okay.

405
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:53,960
Oh, no.

406
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,760
Oh, that's fine.

407
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,200
That's fine.

408
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,760
You're alive.

409
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,300
You're alive.

410
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,800
You're fine.

411
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,340
You're alive.

412
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:58,940
You're alive.

413
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,940
You're alive.

414
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,160
I'm making sure you don't die.

415
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,680
You're alive.

416
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,560
Thank you.

417
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,400
You're alive.

418
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,200
I froze him too.

419
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,760
Huge heal.

420
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,280
Okay, I'm dead here because...

421
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,280
I guess nobody cares?

422
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,960
About me?

423
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,540
Oh.

424
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,160
I died.

425
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,980
I fucking moved our moon knight and I died.

426
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,740
I died and the moon knight left me.

427
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,840
I froze the wolverine just for our moon knight.

428
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,320
And he just ran away.

429
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,800
Welcome to my...

430
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,580
Oh, my God.

431
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,040
Oh, my God.

432
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,360
I thought the moon knight would...

433
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,020
I thought the moon knight would stay with me.

434
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,880
Silly me.

435
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,900
Silly me for thinking that.

436
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,680
Yeah, you're too used to...

437
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm so used to...

438
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm just used to players actually backing me up.

439
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,560
Okay, now I know.

440
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,540
Play for yourself.

441
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,600
I know now, Doobie.

442
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,100
I just...

443
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,920
I can't trust no one.

444
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,620
I just trust you.

445
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,360
That's it.

446
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, thank you.

447
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,200
Me?

448
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,480
Really?

449
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,400
I didn't keep you alive until I died.

450
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,720
Yeah.

451
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,920
I think if we had...

452
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,020
If our DPS was doing better...

453
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,080
Yeah.

454
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,260
I didn't look at the stats, but I'm gonna say...

455
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,700
I think if our DPS and our other two support actually healed...

456
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Then things would have been a lot better.

457
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
Alright, that's it.

458
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,180
I'll lock in.

459
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,420
I'm gonna lock in.

460
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:30,980
Okay.

461
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,120
Someone's like, Jeff is actually good if you're a flanker, but only if you're in top 500.

462
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,880
Do people still play Jeff at that rank?

463
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,800
In top 500?

464
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,780
Okay, the way they play Jeff in top 500 is that they would basically play him as a third DPS.

465
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,820
So like, he can occasionally heal, but all he does is just be in the enemy's backline and be annoying as fuck.

466
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,840
But like, it only works for a triple support.

467
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,860
Like, if you play Jeff in duo support, it's just throwing.

468
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:03,940
Yeah.

469
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,980
Because of his...

470
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,460
Survivability.

471
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, his support ult is not good enough for it.

472
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,880
That makes sense.

473
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,360
Yeah.

474
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,940
I saw there's like, Jeff tech where he goes in the ground really fast and then he comes up really fast.

475
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,920
There's like some Jeff 1 tricks in top 500.

477
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,980
They're like, really fucking annoying because it's so hard.

478
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,020
Even in top 500, they're really hard to kill because they do crazy movement shit.

479
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,460
But I still avoid Jeff players just because...

480
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,380
You don't avoid them?

481
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,180
Yeah, because there's just better support things you can play, you know?

482
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,000
Yeah.

483
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,680
You can play support characters that are so much better than Jeff, so you don't want to risk on a Jeff player.

484
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,820
It's just 1 tricks that are too risky to rely on.

485
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Jeff players are usually 1 tricks?

486
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,440
Yeah, usually.

487
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,060
Like, why would you do that to yourself?

488
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,180
Unless you're a 1 trick of like meta characters, you know?

489
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,800
Like characters that are meta, then it's fine.

490
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,040
Yeah.

491
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,200
Like Moon Knight meta?

492
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,080
Oh yeah, the Moon Knight meta is annoying.

493
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,320
Oh my god, I didn't see the Bucky.

494
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm so dumb.

495
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,700
I didn't see that they have a Bucky.

496
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,040
I was just looking at the Cloak and Dagger and he 1 shot me.

497
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,220
Oh...

498
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,400
This Bucky can aim.

499
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,140
This Bucky actually can aim.

500
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,900
Yeah, don't underestimate us gold players.

501
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:38,860
It's because I was playing gold earlier and then didn't get here.

502
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,460
That's yours?

503
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,220
Okay, I keep like...

504
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,620
Because I'm not used to playing with Fanny, I'm like, which one's yours?

505
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:46,980
Yeah.

506
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,180
Okay.

507
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,320
I'm ready to flank.

508
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,560
Let's see.

509
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,700
This is a little bad.

510
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,000
Alright, I'm ready to push in.

511
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,180
Oh, okay.

512
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,860
Oh, never mind.

513
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,560
What?

514
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,020
I'm getting the mines though.

515
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,640
I got the spider mines.

516
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,740
Fuck.

517
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,660
They're like giving us the point, kind of.

518
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,800
Not really.

519
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
They backed up for a while.

520
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,800
I guess so.

521
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,740
Oh.

522
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,440
Come on, let me...

523
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,680
No!

524
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,260
I was about to ult!

525
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,280
I was just about to ult.

526
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,480
I fucking risked it.

527
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,360
I was gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna risk it all.

528
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,840
You still have it though, right?

529
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Yeah, I do, but I could kill those three.

530
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,160
I was gonna kill three people with my ult.

531
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,320
It's fine, it's fine.

532
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
If they push up...

533
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,280
They have support ults, I'm pretty sure, right?

534
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,420
This penny is like, weird.

535
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,780
Oh, they're bunched up.

536
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,060
Goddamn, get away from me, this Bucky.

537
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,320
Oh my god, this Bucky is good.

538
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,360
This Bucky is actually good.

539
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm so scared of him.

540
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,960
I'm actually scared of him.

541
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,380
He's actually...

542
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,300
He can actually aim.

543
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,180
It's weird.

544
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,440
Maybe they're smurfing.

545
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,680
Please somebody get the mines.

546
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay, I'll just frontline, I'm fine.

547
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,200
I'll frontline.

548
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,900
I'll frontline as a flanker, that's okay.

549
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,020
I'll just frontline.

550
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,920
I'll just frontline.

551
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,580
That's okay.

552
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,560
I don't wanna flank anyway.

553
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,500
Oh my god, get your hands off me!

554
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,100
I died, I died, I died.

555
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
You ran right into my mines.

556
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,840
Yes, thank god.

557
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,560
Thank fucking god.

558
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,140
I feel like I can't play flanker against this comp.

559
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,900
They're way too fucking corny.

560
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,700
That Bucky is way too scary for me.

561
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,300
I'll stay up here.

562
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,600
I'll just shoot down.

563
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,860
Okay, nice.

564
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,720
Nice.

565
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
I have ults soon.

566
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,560
The moon!

567
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,560
Oh, nothing.

568
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,780
That's a random bullshit.

569
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,060
You ever hear these ultimates in your dreams?

570
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,320
Oh yeah, the moon.

571
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,560
They're like, the moon!

572
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,280
And then armed and dangerous.

573
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,240
All the time.

574
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,780
They live in my head, rent-free.

575
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,540
Oh wait, I can...

576
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,260
Stop punching up together, stop punching up!

577
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,400
He's just a solo, she's low, she's low.

578
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,820
She's low, nice.

579
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm gonna focus Captain America.

580
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,340
Don't worry!

581
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,360
Don't worry, invisible woman!

582
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,420
Oh shit, not her.

583
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,760
Wait, where did he go?

584
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,420
Nice.

585
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,280
I'm okay.

586
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,200
Did he die?

587
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,080
Yes, okay.

588
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,080
I'm just scared of one man.

589
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm scared, I'm so...

590
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,480
I fear, I fear him.

591
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
Is he like, watching the backline too?

592
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,340
Like, yeah, like he's protecting his support, so I'm like...

593
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,420
That's why I can't flank, because he's like...

594
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,240
He's like, just guarding it.

595
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,120
So I'm just mowing down the tanks with my Psylocke, so that's fine.

596
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,280
One of my friends, he's like a pro player.

597
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,640
And his main hero pool is like Psylocke, and Psylocke, Starlord, and Bucky.

598
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,020
So he was telling me like, oh yeah, if you can't flank, you can just like, shred tanks frontline as Psylocke.

599
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,980
And I'm like, yippee!

600
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah, that makes sense.

601
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,520
Because like, you can get ult really fast too, if you just stand in the frontline.

602
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,320
I've had a Psylocke on my team where they were doing that, they weren't flanking at all.

603
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,860
They were just standing in the frontline, except they were dying all the time, and then they used their ult.

604
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,820
That was me for like, two deaths, and then I unlocked it.

605
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,860
I was just like, I figured it out.

606
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,480
They never figured it out the whole game.

607
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,620
That's why they're in gold!

608
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
That's sad.

609
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,760
I said, oh, I missed my right click.

610
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,500
I'm so bad with the right click.

611
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,500
This is good practice though, because usually you don't play DPS, right?

612
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,460
Yeah, usually.

613
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,740
Oh my god, of course!

614
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,680
Of course I fucking see you here.

615
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,300
Oh, but I got you.

616
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,040
I got you this time though.

617
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,980
I got him.

618
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,880
I fucking got him.

619
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,040
Oh, fucking, he had res, but I still got you.

620
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,060
We win this?

621
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,300
No?

622
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah, we do.

623
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,100
No, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't.

624
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,740
We do not win this, because for some reason our rest of the team is still frontlining.

625
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,620
Yeah, I see them up there.

626
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,720
I think they're getting killed, maybe?

627
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,980
They're like in the backline, I don't know why.

628
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,620
Oh wait, wait a minute.

629
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,620
There you go.

630
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,560
Oh, that's right.

631
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,400
Nice, nice.

632
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,620
This guy's chasing you, watch out.

633
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,660
I know, I know he is.

634
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,260
They're all chasing me!

635
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,120
Okay, yeah, okay, I'm okay though.

636
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,160
Mantis, what are you doing?

637
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,240
Mantis, you're crazy!

638
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,880
You're so crazy!

639
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,620
He fucking was like running into...

640
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,060
You're so crazy, Mantis.

641
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,300
He's fucking frontlining with me.

642
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,960
You sure that's what you do?

643
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
But I don't trust a gold Mantis to be up here.

644
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,600
Maybe they're smurfing too.

645
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,280
They can't all be smurfs, Doobie!

646
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,820
There has to be real players here!

647
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,440
There has to be real players in gold!

648
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,240
Yeah, but you don't think they're also going against gold players though, you know?

649
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Oh my god.

650
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,820
Oh, he's so low!

651
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,040
Oh my god, he actually got healed though.

652
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,520
I have ult soon.

653
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,340
I'm not gonna peek this because...

654
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,360
Oh, he's on Psylocke!

655
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,260
That's right, I'm better!

656
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,260
That's right!

657
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,620
No fear now.

658
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,240
I don't have fear now that he's on Psylocke.

659
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,460
Man, they're mad that if they switch to the same thing...

660
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,600
He's actually trying to mirror me.

661
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,980
Oh my god, that's crazy.

662
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,680
I feel good though, like I'll play Venom and I feel like I'm doing really good and then the other tank switches to Venom.

663
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,940
Yeah, and you're just like, wait a minute, was I actually doing stuff?

664
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh my god.

665
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,220
Oh, I forced ult, nice.

666
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,460
Nice.

667
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,640
Okay, Starlord, you should have waited a little start bit.

668
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:42,780
Oh, hey.

669
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,340
Oh, I fucked his ult.

670
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,480
They're so mad.

671
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,960
That's right!

672
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,720
Oh, and he goes GG!

673
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,940
Oh, you should have stayed, Bucky!

674
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,760
I was actually scared!

675
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,300
Now that you're not Bucky, I'm free to do whatever the fuck I want!

676
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm gonna spawn camp.

677
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,120
Let's go.

678
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,220
I see you, Psylocke.

679
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,700
I see you over there.

680
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,080
Wait, actually, I don't.

681
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,720
Where did he go?

682
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,180
Wait, he disappeared.

683
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,560
Maybe he jumped off?

684
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,380
Wait, what the fuck, Wolverine?

685
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,400
The moment he swapped off of Bucky, I knew it was over for him.

686
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,820
GG.

687
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,500
Yeah, see, we told you guys.

688
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,320
First game was just warm-up.

689
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,500
Yeah.

690
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,640
Oh, hey, look!

691
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,920
Yippee!

692
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,380
Don't look at my accuracy, it's not real.

693
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,340
I was missing my right clicks and everything.

694
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,500
Wait, actually, what's the... I think I forgot to charge my mouse.

695
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,760
Oh, you have a wireless one?

696
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,420
Do you use wireless?

698
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,800
No, I have a wired one.

699
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,460
I got a Zowie.

700
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,360
Oh, I use a G Pro Wireless.

701
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,340
I can't do wired, because it's like...

702
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,100
When you go wired... Have you ever tried wireless?

703
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,280
No, I never tried it.

704
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,160
It feels heavy, though.

705
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,860
Or isn't it?

706
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,600
No, no, no, no.

707
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,720
If you try a G Pro Wire... There's a Super Light.

708
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,280
If you try a Super Light...

709
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,360
Are you advertising to me right now?

710
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,580
Not sponsored, by the way.

711
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,560
But if you want to use my referral code...

712
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,760
Wait, really?

713
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,220
You have one?

714
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,580
No, I wish I could have a referral code from G...

715
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,140
It would be huge!

716
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,180
What was the company from Intel, right?

717
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,340
Logitech?

718
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,640
Yeah, Logitech.

719
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,780
We all blur together.

720
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,880
If it's sponsored by Logitech, that would be fucking crazy.

721
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,520
I've used G Pro Wireless for so long.

722
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,460
They're super light.

723
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,060
When I swapped from wired to wireless, it was lighter than my wired.

724
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,540
But they have weights and stuff that you can add.

725
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,720
Counterweight.

726
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,660
I don't know.

727
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,800
I think you'd like wireless.

728
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:11,800
When I went wired from wireless, I realized just how intrusive the wires were when I'm moving around.

729
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,760
I have a shitty $13 wireless mouse I use for my second PC.

730
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,120
It's so I can click on OBS stuff without changing my mouse.

731
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,760
That's so true.

732
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,120
Alright, let's see.

733
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Triple DPS, let's go!

734
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,800
I don't really play.

735
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,500
I figured... I don't play Halo.

736
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,980
I don't know how to play it, but I figured I might as well.

737
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,980
Might as well try it out.

738
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,820
It seems like point and click.

739
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,060
I don't know.

740
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,820
I haven't played it either.

741
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,900
It seems like it though.

742
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:48,080
I'm also using a new crosshair because I got too lazy to use my actual...

743
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,840
Oh shit!

744
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,960
I hate Black Panther.

745
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,440
Someone break his knees right now.

746
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,280
Oh no, I don't know what counters Black Panther!

747
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,160
That's a DPS!

748
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Oh!

749
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,240
I don't know.

750
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,760
Just leave it to me.

751
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,640
Chat, what counters Black Panther as a DPS player?

752
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,340
Alright, let me figure it out.

753
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,040
Because I don't know how to...

754
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,160
I wonder... Namor?

755
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,260
Oh, you're right, Namor.

756
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,380
I don't know how to play Namor.

757
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,640
But it can't be that hard.

758
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,640
I just put out turrets.

759
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah.

760
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,020
Aiming.

761
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,960
So it's like, just aim.

762
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,520
Oh man, I wish I could just aim.

763
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,680
I wish I have a Luna then.

764
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,360
Oh, I mean it's projectile, so...

765
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,920
That's right!

766
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,060
Try and dive me!

767
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,880
I have turrets!

768
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,880
That's fucking right!

769
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,040
I think Penny Parker is also anti-dive.

770
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,300
Yeah, she's anti-dive too.

771
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,280
Alright.

772
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,480
Try and dive me!

773
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,260
That's fucking right!

774
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,380
Oh, they double support ulted.

775
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,220
That's good for us.

776
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,340
Okay, I did not expect her to do that.

777
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,440
But alright, I'll slowly head over to the invisible world then.

778
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,180
Oh, we also double support ulted.

779
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,800
Okay.

780
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,060
Oh, are you okay?

781
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,760
Oh, you're dead.

782
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,860
No, I'm dead!

783
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,900
You're so dead.

784
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,240
You're definitely not...

785
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,920
You're definitely not okay.

786
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,940
That's fucking right!

787
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,780
He can't dive my supports, but...

788
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,100
Other than that, we're not doing anything.

789
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,900
I don't know...

790
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,720
Oh, I got two.

791
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,640
Nice.

792
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,380
Okay.

793
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,600
That's fucking right.

794
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,000
Get turret.

795
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,780
Get turreted.

796
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,020
Oh no.

797
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,740
Get turreted.

798
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,540
No!

799
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,380
Oh, he got full HP.

800
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,080
Goddammit.

801
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,160
Well, we got the point.

802
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,200
There's a Panther still back here.

803
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,340
That's fine.

804
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,720
I got Starlord though.

805
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,820
I have turrets everywhere.

806
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:42,960
That's right!

807
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,920
Try and dive this!

808
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,120
That's right!

809
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,060
Dive this!

810
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:49,980
Nice.

811
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,300
That's fucking right.

812
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,420
I'm just putting them on the ground.

813
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,740
I'm not even angling them.

814
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,980
Oh, this is bad.

815
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,320
Oh, Jk.

816
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,340
That's right!

817
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,060
Get turreted!

818
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,220
He's just on the turret.

819
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,100
Oh yeah, you can't do anything!

820
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,800
That's fucking right!

821
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,060
Go back to Wakanda!

822
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,460
That's right!

823
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,620
Go back to Wakanda where you belong.

824
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,980
Oh, I got the ult.

825
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm just like, random.

826
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,320
Oh, he actually is getting hit by the...

827
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,880
Nah, he got out.

828
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
Yeah, he was like 1 HP.

829
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,720
He was actually 1 HP.

830
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,840
Oh, do we have...

831
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:43,680
I don't know where people are, but I'm assuming that my things are doing stuff, honestly.

832
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,320
Where is Wakanda?

833
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,520
Where is he?

834
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,760
I have my turret just chilling.

835
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,540
I don't know where he is.

836
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,940
I'm a little worried.

837
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,940
I was going to say, isn't this Wakanda, but this is not Wakanda.

838
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,060
No, this is not Wakanda!

839
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,620
He's not back home yet.

840
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,900
Oh, I don't know where you have support ults for this.

841
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,660
Oh, I should have saved it.

842
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,400
What the hell?

843
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,520
What is he doing here?

844
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,220
Oh, no!

845
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,200
No!

846
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,740
I think I'm going to switch to Venom 2.

847
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,140
Oh, no.

848
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,600
It's okay.

849
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,440
We still have one more fight.

850
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,800
Alright, okay.

851
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,080
I got Venomed hard.

852
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,380
I wasted my ult because I thought we were going to win it for some reason.

853
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,680
I don't know why I thought we were going to win.

854
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,060
It was very obvious.

855
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,060
We were not winning that fight.

856
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,520
I don't know.

857
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,260
I was just...

858
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,800
We have to... We're not getting that.

859
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,020
I get melted.

860
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,200
It's like the only tank.

861
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:54,800
No!

862
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,080
Especially with Boondight.

863
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:04,020
I shut down their Black Panther, so we couldn't do anything after that.

864
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,640
Now, we just need the rest of our team to do stuff.

865
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm trying!

866
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,740
I'm trying!

867
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,660
No, no, not you.

868
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,920
You're our only tank.

869
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,960
It's never the solo tank's fault.

870
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,000
It's the other players.

871
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,460
It's never the solo tank.

872
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,020
We could really use another tank.

873
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,920
Yeah, maybe someone will switch.

874
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,780
Maybe more for a Panther counter.

875
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:41,900
Yeah, I'm like... I nearly got... I got rid of... I got rid of Panther for so long because of me.

876
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,480
Yeah, I think it helped too.

877
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,660
Yeah, me and you, we just... They just had... I mean, they're literally running meta.

878
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,660
Fucking nerds.

879
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,760
Why are you running meta in gold?

880
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,540
Is that the meta?

881
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,420
Yeah, Mag, Strange is meta.

882
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,620
All I'm saying is you're still Track Force, Mag, Strange in gold and you're not climbing.

883
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,480
It's not the meta problem.

884
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,320
It's not.

885
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,260
You're running meta wrong and you might as well just play off meta.

886
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,380
It's not, yeah.

887
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,520
I just think you might as well play off meta if you can't... you can't even climb meta.

888
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,380
Yeah, we got a Megiddo now.

889
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,060
We're meta too.

890
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,440
Oh my gosh, whoops.

891
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,920
I threw a little bit.

892
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,420
I used my shift, but that's a miss.

893
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,000
I have Venom as well.

894
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,960
Oh, they're running Venom now.

895
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,920
Yeah, I switched it up.

896
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,360
I think I mismapped New Harker's.

897
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
Maybe you're trying to...

898
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,780
Oh, that's fine.

899
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,100
Disappear.

900
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,040
That's fine.

901
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,180
Oh, you can't do anything about it.

902
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,760
Okay, like, please one flanker at a time.

903
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,540
Are they diving together at all?

904
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,860
Yeah, I got both Panther and Venom on my ass just then.

905
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,220
I was like, okay guys, one at a time if you're gonna flank me.

906
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,220
I have no idea how to use the Penny Parker ult.

907
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,600
Yeah, you just use it on...

908
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
What is this?

909
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,160
Oh.

910
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,440
You just use it on the point.

911
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,540
I don't know.

912
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,980
This is my very first time playing anymore, by the way.

913
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,580
I'm like a little...

914
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,480
Isn't he fun?

915
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:25,860
Hey, nice.

916
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,540
I got a kill.

917
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,780
Alright, yeah.

918
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,180
Come on.

919
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,980
Go for the turret.

920
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,360
He's like... he's like weird to aim a little, though.

921
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,160
I would admit.

922
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:35,980
Oh, yeah.

923
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,980
It's not hitscan.

924
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,280
It's like...

925
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,200
Yeah, it's projectile.

926
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,920
It has drop-off, too.

927
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,340
Yeah.

928
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,460
Wait, it has drop-off?

929
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,040
I didn't even know that.

930
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,380
Yeah.

931
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,160
I didn't even know that.

932
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,000
Now I do.

933
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,060
It's pretty far, though, I think.

934
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,900
Like, I'm so disorienting trying to aim with it.

935
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,880
Oh, okay.

936
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,880
Nice.

937
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,540
Alright.

938
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,440
Ah, the ult!

939
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,920
I ulted it, though, but I don't know if it does anything.

940
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
You knocked Strange down.

941
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,520
That helped.

942
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,840
It's just the Moon Knight was above just spamming.

943
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,120
I got him off.

944
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,280
It's fine.

945
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,080
I'm basically shutting him... how does he... Black Panther get killed?

946
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,420
I've been, like, shutting him down.

947
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,900
Yeah, I haven't seen him.

948
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,700
Yeah, he's just like, where are you?

949
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,760
Maybe I'll just play next to my support, just in case.

950
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,940
But our support positions so weirdly sometimes.

951
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,340
They, like, position in them, and I was like, I don't want to be in them.

952
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,200
Really?

953
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,140
Yeah, they're, like, frontlining sometimes.

954
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,260
And I'm like, well, I don't want to be there.

955
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,380
Yeah.

956
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:37,960
Honestly.

957
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,780
Oh, the Moon Knight's one.

958
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,040
Oh, there he is.

959
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,960
Okay, I got him.

960
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,400
I got... oh, wait, I got Moon Knight.

961
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,040
Nice.

962
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,180
I'm putting my turrets at the weirdest spots, but somehow it's working?

963
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,260
Because I think it's just the ELO?

964
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,140
Yeah, yeah.

965
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,540
They don't shoot at it.

966
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,320
They're, like, uh...

967
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,960
Yeah, like, these are pretty bad spots, not gonna lie.

968
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,040
Like, but I'll take those.

969
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,340
I know as a gold player myself, I'll see them and I'll just walk by them and hope somebody else deals with them.

970
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Yeah, some of them don't even shoot the Angs too, which I've noticed.

971
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,180
You know, that I try to shoot, but I can't.

972
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,260
No!

973
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,820
No, not the Moon!

974
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,740
All the ults.

975
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,460
No!

976
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,780
Okay, I guess I'll stay on there.

977
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,080
It's alright.

978
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,220
It's okay.

979
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,640
I have my ult.

980
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,760
Yeah, just wait until everybody's up.

981
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,520
Oh my god, I'm coming over.

982
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,160
I'm walking.

983
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,540
Oh, nice Conchu, but, like, I don't know if we should use it now because we're not here, but that's alright.

984
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah, we'll be the only one there.

985
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,680
I was like, alright, I mean, that's cool.

986
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,820
That's cool, but, you know, we're all...

987
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,400
I don't know about that.

988
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,360
And solo.

989
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,700
Oh no!

990
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,880
I went in to try to help the Moon Knight.

991
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,620
I should've waited.

992
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,160
Okay, look.

993
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,960
Oh my god.

994
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,120
I don't know.

995
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,980
At this point, I'll just use it here.

996
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,020
I'm still there on the point, but, like, I don't feel so good.

997
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,540
What is that line from the movie?

998
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,780
Like, I don't feel so good.

999
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,400
I don't feel so good.

1000
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,660
Bro, I just saw the mech behind me watching me.

1001
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,900
I was just like, what are you doing?

1002
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,140
Oh my god.

1003
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,600
I tried to stall.

1004
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,300
The Moon.

1005
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,820
It's okay.

1006
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,580
It's not our fault.

1007
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,560
It's not us.

1008
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,480
It's never us.

1009
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,480
We're streamers.

1010
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,640
It's never the streamer's fault.

1011
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,780
He mates.

1012
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,880
Yeah, exactly.

1013
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:12,080
I literally was, like, on the point and I turned around and see our mech just watching me out off of point.

1014
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,720
I'm just like, okay, alright, that's...

1015
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,320
I'm okay with that, I guess.

1016
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,760
Maybe I shouldn't play Penny Parker on, like, control point.

1017
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,060
Maybe it's too... I don't know.

1018
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,280
Sometimes it works, but sometimes not so much.

1019
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,220
Well, it should work because we were playing against Black Panther.

1020
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,840
It's just our team wasn't shutting down Panther enough.

1021
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,260
I played Namor and then the Panther literally just stopped trying to dive me.

1022
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,060
Like, he ran away from me all of a sudden.

1023
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,400
He gave up.

1024
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,240
Yeah, he gave up because I had, like, turrets with me.

1025
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:55,660
But I guess, like, he just went after my support players because I didn't know where the fuck they went.

1026
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,500
I was like, where's my support?

1027
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,300
Yeah, I didn't really see them, but maybe it's my fault because I didn't turn around.

1028
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,360
As a tank, you don't really see them often, too, because you're just...

1029
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,740
You're always, like, you know, you just have to look at the front.

1030
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:12,920
What's this?

1031
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,060
Oh, this is the newest map.

1032
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,760
I heard... I was gonna try Storm.

1033
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,520
This is a good Penny Parker map.

1034
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,460
Maybe.

1035
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:22,980
Maybe.

1036
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:23,880
I don't know.

1037
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,440
I have no idea because, like I said, I never see Penny.

1038
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,260
I never see Penny in my...

1039
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,500
I mean, this is supposed to be New York, so it's like Spider-Man.

1040
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,020
That's true.

1041
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,560
That's where Spider-Man lives.

1042
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,500
Penny Parker lives in Japan, doesn't she?

1043
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,960
I mean, you know, it's another city.

1044
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,520
One concrete jungle to another.

1045
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,020
You're right, you're right.

1046
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,440
Tokyo is also a city.

1047
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,480
Tokyo, New York is basically the same, right?

1048
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,620
I mean, New York is, like, kind of stuck in the past, but...

1049
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,120
Yeah, they're pretty similar.

1050
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,960
Alright, I am... I hope I get healed.

1051
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,020
I hope.

1052
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,540
That's really all I hope for.

1053
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,880
Alright, I'm on damage.

1054
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,620
Oh, I got the heal.

1055
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,780
I got heal off.

1056
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,540
Oh my god, that's crazy.

1057
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,860
I was not expecting it.

1058
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,520
I was not exp... What the fuck?

1059
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,540
No, not another...

1060
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,820
Oh my god, okay.

1061
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,860
No, I don't... I don't want to go no more!

1062
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,540
God damn it.

1063
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,920
Oh, I don't want to go no more, though.

1064
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,980
He's gone!

1065
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,380
He has a big whale.

1066
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,220
It's so cool.

1067
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,980
I just don't know his projectile enough to, like, go him.

1068
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,060
Man, there's a Moon Knight in every single game.

1069
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,900
It's so annoying.

1070
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,860
Oh, wait, are you doing Moon Knight grid?

1071
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,080
Oh, I hate that.

1072
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,240
I hate that comp.

1073
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,480
Oh, I guess I'll learn no more.

1074
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,900
I guess it's time.

1075
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,940
Why do we have, like... Don't have a Luna... The moment I play no more, we don't have a Luna player.

1076
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,380
Yeah, that's really useful.

1077
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,180
Shoot the Ankh!

1078
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,420
Their Ankh, where is it?

1079
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,840
No, it's... I got it.

1080
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,620
I got it.

1081
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,060
Yeah, we got one.

1082
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,080
Nice.

1083
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,880
Nice, I have turrets.

1084
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,220
Come on, you should be dead.

1085
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,380
There we go, we did it.

1086
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
It was just that easy.

1087
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:30,220
Okay, I'm, like, a little scared to go up... like, group up because of the fact that they have a Groot.

1088
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,020
Yeah, a Groot and Moon Knight.

1089
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,380
That's basically it.

1090
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,560
Okay.

1091
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,780
I have turrets on me, but I'm trying to break the walls right now.

1092
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,820
I got one guy.

1093
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,400
Nice!

1094
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,700
I got Black Panther.

1095
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,680
I got DP.

1096
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,700
He is so looking for ult.

1097
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,000
Oh my god, look at him.

1098
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,960
He's just... he's looking for it.

1099
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,140
Oh, I'm trying to break this.

1100
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,760
I'm trying to break this.

1101
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,340
I'm the only one trying to break this stupid tree!

1102
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,520
I'm walking around.

1103
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,340
I spent, like, 20 seconds just trying to break the wall.

1104
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,880
That was a mistake.

1105
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,820
I should not have done that.

1106
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
Alright, that's fine.

1107
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,900
Oh, that's fine.

1108
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,020
I'm not okay right now, but that's fine.

1109
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,640
Where is she?

1110
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,320
No, it was right there!

1111
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,420
I was on it!

1112
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,120
Where are you?

1113
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,900
There you go, I got him.

1114
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:35,980
Oh, nice.

1115
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,320
I got him.

1116
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,040
Don't worry, the evil has been defeated.

1117
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,800
I sent him back to Wakanda.

1118
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,880
It's fine.

1119
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,120
Please!

1120
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,220
Oh my god, it's so cute!

1121
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,080
Oh, please, I'm just a little baby.

1122
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,560
Oh, there it is!

1123
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,540
Goodbye, everybody!

1124
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,100
Goodbye!

1125
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:55,960
I leave!

1126
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,760
The wombo combo.

1127
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,120
I got mine killed, though.

1128
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,480
That's pretty cool.

1129
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,100
That's right!

1130
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,820
Oh, you're scared!

1131
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,000
You're so scared.

1132
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,780
I have turrets.

1133
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,000
That's goddamn right.

1134
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,440
Okay, but like... Oh my god, that's alright.

1135
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,200
We don't have healers right now, but that's fine.

1136
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,520
I'm just gonna stay here.

1137
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,000
They're on their way.

1138
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,520
They're behind me.

1139
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,580
Oh, that was unlucky.

1140
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,480
Both are...

1141
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,960
Oh, I thought they were closer.

1142
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,720
Oh wait, no, I did.

1143
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,280
I knocked him down.

1144
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,860
You knocked one, I think.

1145
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,700
Do you know Marvel characters and stuff a little bit?

1146
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,760
Yeah, but I'm more of a DC fan, though.

1147
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,100
I just never really liked the Marvel Cinematic... I didn't like the movie cinematic universe that much.

1148
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:52,680
I don't know if you think so, but it got way too formulaic at one point.

1149
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,220
I haven't really watched them.

1150
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,080
I didn't watch any of the Marvel movies except for Guardians of the Galaxy.

1151
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,840
Oh yeah, I like Guardians of the Galaxy.

1152
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,560
I think it's the music that makes it.

1153
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,190
Yeah, it's the music and it's like, you know the director, James Gunn?

1154
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,360
Yeah.

1155
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,860
Yeah, I love his stuff.

1156
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:20,060
His stuff is so different from... I mean, you can say that they're formulaic now because he has the formula, but it's just different from Marvel and stuff.

1157
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,540
Have you seen his newest anime thing, the Creature Commandos?

1158
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,440
I don't think so.

1159
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:25,780
What is that?

1160
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,160
Oh my god, it's like he's rebooting DC now.

1161
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,340
Now he's working for DC.

1162
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,960
He's doing really well.

1163
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,880
He did really well with Marvel, so DC hired him.

1164
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,440
And it's basically like, you know the Suicide Squad?

1165
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They're rebooting the Suicide Squad, but animated for him.

1166
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,620
Honestly, I highly recommend it.

1167
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,820
I am the only DPS that has more kills than the rest of the DPS!

1168
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,920
You can't say it was me!

1169
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,140
And all I've been doing is just...

1170
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,980
I think it's just that we don't have another... I don't know, maybe it's because I don't play any other tanks.

1171
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,260
I can play Strange for you, but then they'll have to complain even more.

1172
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,360
Like, they can't complain about DPS when I'm literally the only one that's doing something for us.

1173
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,300
The hello melts me so bad.

1174
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:20,820
Yeah,

1175
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,300
I can't freaking live right now.

1176
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,600
That's fine.

1177
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,240
It's fine, because every win we get, we get... Guys, please touch it.

1178
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,460
Please touch it, guys.

1179
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,040
No!

1180
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,540
It's okay, we're a little too good.

1181
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,660
It's fine, it's fine.

1182
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,300
Oh my god, this hella has 24 kills.

1183
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,260
I wish I could play a character that we're not forced to do anti-dive.

1184
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,920
Yeah, I mean, now that we're on attack...

1185
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,080
That's true, that's true.

1186
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,560
That's true.

1187
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,240
Just let our team die.

1188
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,820
When you please hit attack, it's just soloing.

1189
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,700
How can we hit anything?

1190
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,980
Oh, wait, wait.

1191
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,260
You can play DPS now.

1192
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,300
Oh, you can play Namor!

1193
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,160
You can play Namor!

1194
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,020
Nevermind.

1195
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,420
I mean, one take is viable, right?

1196
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:18,960
Yeah, that's fine.

1197
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,880
You should play Namor.

1198
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,960
You know how to play Namor.

1199
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,900
I was learning as we go.

1200
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,320
I was literally learning how to play as we go.

1201
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,880
This is like my second game on Namor.

1202
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,060
But yeah, no, you should check out... I think you'd like Creature Commandos.

1203
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,640
It's actually a really good animation.

1204
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,640
Because if you like Guardians of the Galaxy, you might like Creature Commandos.

1205
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,720
Is it out already?

1206
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,140
I thought it was just the...

1207
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,200
Yeah, the full series ended like last week.

1208
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,300
Oh, okay.

1209
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,020
Wait, on what?

1210
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,360
Is it like a Disney?

1211
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,340
Not Disney, no.

1212
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,140
It's on...

1213
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:51,440
Paramount?

1214
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,100
I think so.

1215
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,640
I think?

1216
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,740
I don't remember where it was on.

1217
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,960
But I personally really like it.

1218
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,480
There's like... Okay, so like, you know, there's like screenshots, like GIFs of it everywhere.

1219
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,380
But GI... I think you'd like the character GI Robot, I think.

1220
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,140
GI Robot?

1221
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,160
GI Robot.

1222
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,720
GI Robot.

1223
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,380
Oh, wait, is that the one?

1224
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,300
I think I've seen it.

1225
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,700
On Twitter?

1226
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,320
That's where it comes from.

1228
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,360
That's where GI comes from.

1229
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,880
I like the music that people were... I don't know if it's like wind up something boy.

1230
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:31,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,480
I think like... Wait, have you ever watched the Peacemaker with John Cena?

1232
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,820
Oh, no, I haven't seen it.

1233
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,440
Oh, I think... Oh, you'd like that too then.

1234
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,760
Because it's also James Gunn.

1235
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,160
Oh, okay.

1236
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,700
Because I think you just really... I think you just like James Gunn.

1237
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,660
Like James Gunn directed things?

1238
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,260
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

1239
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,180
Because he has like... His personal style is like destroy the...

1240
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,300
Try...

1241
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,620
Okay, I'm gonna switch.

1242
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,860
Where are you gonna switch to?

1243
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,700
Okay, if you're gonna do that, I'm gonna... If we have a rocket anyway, so...

1244
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,680
I'll just play Call of Duty.

1245
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,580
Oh, Lunis, that was the one in the back.

1246
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,060
Nevermind, shut up.

1247
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,560
They were all so low.

1248
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,920
I'm just gonna... They were all so low.

1249
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,200
And we have...

1250
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,920
Nice.

1251
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,060
Yeah, I think you'd like Peacemaker too.

1252
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,800
What are your favorite shows then?

1253
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,660
What do you tend to watch?

1254
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,740
I watch The Voice.

1255
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,820
I watch Invincible.

1256
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:37,540
Invincible.

1257
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,700
They're not my favorite, but I enjoyed watching them, I guess.

1258
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,940
What are your favorite shows in general?

1259
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,460
Like, not just superheroes.

1260
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,500
I've just been watching anime.

1261
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,020
I don't know.

1262
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,680
I don't watch that much TV, I guess, or shows.

1263
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,600
I'm different.

1264
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,880
It's because for me, I just don't have... I'm dead.

1265
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
I heard the Moon Knight.

1266
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,780
I was like, there's no way I'm living through that.

1267
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,880
For me, I just don't have time to watch anime, because you know how it's like...

1268
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,900
In anime, you have to read the subtitles.

1269
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,400
Oh, yeah.

1270
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,620
You can't read?

1271
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,020
No, I feel like...

1272
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,360
Yeah, no, you're right.

1273
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,220
No, you're right.

1274
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,920
You're right.

1275
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,100
I can't read.

1276
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,760
But I'm also like... You know how I'm a workaholic, so I get lazy.

1277
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,700
Not lazy, but like...

1278
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,000
Wait, where?

1279
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,460
Oh, you like to do stuff while watching shows, right?

1280
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,820
Yeah, I like to do stuff while watching.

1281
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,040
That makes sense.

1282
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,980
Yes, I feel like I'm like not being productive.

1283
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,460
Wait, we capped it?

1284
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,580
Where the fuck was there...

1285
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,220
Somehow...

1286
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,120
I don't even see anyone alive.

1287
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,040
I was not even...

1288
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,280
How the fuck did we cap it?

1289
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,920
That's crazy.

1290
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,400
I think this... I think the enemy team is stacking.

1291
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,280
They're like way too coordinated, you know?

1292
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,660
Oh, that makes sense.

1293
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,460
Yeah, maybe it's a four stack or something.

1294
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,820
Yeah, no, this team feels way too...

1295
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,100
Oh, no.

1296
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,780
This is where I die.

1297
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,120
Oh, that's cool.

1298
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,380
Hey, I'm in it too.

1299
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,240
He has nowhere to... He has nowhere to throw it, but like...

1300
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,640
He's gonna throw us into his team.

1301
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,240
No!

1302
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,460
I should've shot the Jeff instead of Luna.

1303
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,020
Yeah, she was keeping him up.

1304
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:27,500
Yeah.

1305
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,980
I'm coming over.

1306
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,180
I like how my chat was like, just learn Japanese.

1307
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,500
Oh, yeah, let's meet...

1308
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,780
That's a lot of work.

1309
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,280
Let me just learn another language real quick.

1310
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,600
You can do the dub version for some of them.

1311
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,400
Yeah, but it's not the same, I feel like.

1312
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,260
Yeah, it's just not the same.

1313
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,140
Jesus Christ, where is this stupid Black Panther?

1314
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,820
Alright, I'm just gonna wait until...

1315
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,180
I hate you.

1316
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,900
Get me out of here.

1317
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,900
Get me out of here.

1318
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,300
Do you think DC will make a game like this?

1319
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:12,820
DC?

1320
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,940
They tried.

1321
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:15,940
They did?

1322
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,280
I feel like they have to like...

1323
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,620
Oh my gosh, I forgot.

1324
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,520
I have my fucking glasses toggled on.

1325
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,760
So every time I press 1, I wear my glasses.

1326
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,940
But like, I feel like...

1327
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,900
I don't know.

1328
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,940
They tried to make games for it.

1329
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,120
They tried to make live service games.

1330
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,560
You know, the Suicide Squad one?

1331
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,560
No, I didn't know they had one.

1332
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,520
There's a reason why you don't know.

1333
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,860
It was like a live service game.

1334
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,660
So it was like...

1335
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,240
It's apparently, you know, like the Batman Gotham City.

1336
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,460
Like those games and stuff.

1337
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,260
Basically, it's like...

1338
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,860
It's not...

1339
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,160
Like, everybody loves the Gotham City and the Dark Knight and all that for the game.

1340
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,020
But like, the...

1341
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:09,740
So like, it was supposed to be the sequel to the Batman series.

1342
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,560
But then it's really, really, really, really, really...

1343
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,500
Like Dark Knight, yeah, it's really, really bad.

1344
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,040
I'm not gonna die.

1345
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,520
Oh, now we have Luna!

1346
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,260
Okay.

1347
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,120
I get so melted.

1348
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,360
Yeah, and then...

1349
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,460
The game was supposed to have like a long story.

1350
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,160
And it was gonna be like a super long, like...

1351
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,840
Lots of DLCs and stuff.

1352
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,600
Season passes and things like that.

1353
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:42,120
And then like, it literally just ended in...

1354
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,980
I don't think he knows that...

1355
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,460
That like, you know...

1356
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,300
You can't eat me.

1357
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,760
I don't think he knows that.

1358
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,220
Ah, fucking hell.

1359
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,020
I like, went back into it.

1360
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:56,860
That's it!

1361
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,560
I almost went back into it.

1362
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,660
So wait, what type of game was it?

1363
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,240
It was a live service game.

1364
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,540
So you know like, there's like a progression.

1365
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,300
I don't know how to explain it.

1366
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,580
But it's basically like, Assassin's Creed type deal.

1367
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,920
So it's like a progress...

1368
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,960
You know, you find things, there's missions.

1369
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,820
But it's just not good.

1370
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,460
Oh no, it's not good?

1371
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,780
Looter Shooter.

1372
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,760
Yeah, it's a Looter Shooter type deal.

1373
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,320
But there's like, battle pass and stuff like that.

1374
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,340
And it literally died...

1375
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,960
It died in a year.

1376
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,160
It died in a year.

1377
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,280
And then they...

1378
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,440
Cause like, the biggest thing that people hated...

1379
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,700
Was the fact that like, they killed off Batman.

1380
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,580
On a series about...

1381
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,700
That was supposed to be like, the sequel to like, Arkham Knight.

1382
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,780
And it was so fucked up because like...

1383
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,140
You know like, the voice actor for Batman.

1384
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,900
It was considered to be one of his last roles.

1385
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,300
So like...

1386
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,380
So like...

1387
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:04,860
Because...

1388
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,860
So they were like, you just killed him off?

1389
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,700
And then, people found out...

1390
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,520
Like, last week, cause the game ended.

1391
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,140
They were like, JK, they were just clones.

1392
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,260
Ah...

1393
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,520
What?

1394
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,600
Yeah, cause they killed off the entire Justice League.

1395
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,320
And they're like, JK, they didn't actually...

1396
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,320
They were just clones.

1397
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,460
So they did it just to like, get...

1398
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,560
Like, just to bait people and get engagement.

1399
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,100
Which is pretty fucked.

1400
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,880
That just sounds like something they came up with afterwards, right?

1401
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1402
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,740
Be like, no guys, don't be upset.

1403
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,040
No, no, stop, don't be upset.

1404
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,340
They're not actually dead.

1405
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,840
See, look.

1406
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,820
Somebody said spoilers, but I'm pretty sure...

1407
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,980
You can't play it anymore, right?

1408
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,840
Or can you still play it?

1409
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,000
You can still play it, but like...

1410
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,900
If you're like, mad about spoilers...

1411
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,820
On a game that's bad, like...

1412
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,520
I don't think you should be mad about spoilers.

1413
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,420
That game was absolutely terrible.

1414
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,000
They're literally shutting it down in a few months too.

1415
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,540
Oh, okay.

1416
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,220
What?

1417
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,360
You still have time to play it?

1418
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,400
Yeah, guys.

1419
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,720
Guys, you wanna spend $40?

1420
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,860
Oh, yeah, oh.

1421
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,740
Yeah, it's like $40+, because it's a AAA game.

1422
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,820
So it's like $40+.

1423
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,840
And then it'll just close down and you'll lose your money.

1424
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,860
Yep, yeah.

1425
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,460
Yes, that's why people were mad that it was live service.

1426
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,320
Because they're like, why are you...

1427
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,640
Like, it's gonna close down because of the reception.

1428
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:34,860
Yeah.

1429
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,480
It's just like, at least it's not like Concord.

1430
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,140
Concord?

1431
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,940
Did you play that?

1432
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,840
I really wanted to.

1433
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,980
I wanted to play it so badly.

1434
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,420
They shut it...

1435
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,360
Because I think I was like...

1436
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,960
I think I was like away or something.

1437
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,280
So I couldn't play it.

1438
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,100
I was like on a trip or something.

1439
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,320
Maybe I was like rehearsing for the concert.

1440
01:00:59,140 --> 01:00:59,980
Oh, yeah.

1441
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,280
So I couldn't check it.

1442
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,320
And then the moment they shut it down, it was too late.

1443
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,380
I was gone.

1444
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,820
There's a Wolverine.

1445
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,780
He's gonna kidnap.

1446
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,680
Use his passive though.

1447
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,680
Oh, but it doesn't matter.

1448
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,340
Our guy's fucking dead.

1449
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,100
I'm on it.

1450
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,040
I got her.

1451
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,760
Oh, shit.

1452
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,140
Oh, okay.

1453
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,340
That's fine.

1454
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,860
Wait, I know he does that passive.

1455
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,000
Oh, no, he's dead.

1456
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,020
He's actually...

1457
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,280
He's getting healed.

1458
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,400
That's illegal.

1459
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,100
Oh, my God.

1460
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,080
Wait, we still have these points.

1461
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,940
Why is Rocket?

1462
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,940
I'm just fucking playing.

1463
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,240
Yeah, you have the blue thingy.

1464
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,020
Oh, wait.

1465
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,760
I have all the red.

1466
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,480
Oh, wait, all the DPS.

1467
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,440
Oh, my God.

1468
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,300
Mr. Fantastic, come on.

1469
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:57,980
Go get him.

1470
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:58,920
Go.

1471
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
I got him.

1472
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:02,880
I got him.

1473
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,020
It's time we capped it.

1474
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:05,540
There you go.

1475
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,920
He's haha'ing now.

1476
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:07,900
Haha!

1477
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,440
Haha!

1478
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,140
Wait, actually, I can force something out.

1479
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,100
There you go.

1480
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,300
I forced a support ult.

1481
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:20,680
Haha!

1482
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:21,680
Oh, nice.

1483
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:22,900
Haha!

1484
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,260
Oh, I'm dead though.

1485
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:24,920
He's so bad.

1486
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,240
I'm dead.

1487
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,560
She died from it because Mantis ult is...

1488
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,580
The more people are grouped up, the more you get healed.

1489
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,340
But everybody ran from her.

1490
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:38,720
Also, I heard for Psylocke's ult, you can outlive it if all your team is jumping it.

1491
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1492
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,980
If you stack up, there's a potential to live for it.

1493
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,340
Oh, oh.

1494
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,800
He's saying that ult.

1495
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,440
That's right.

1496
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,860
What you gonna do to me?

1497
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,500
You have no more abilities here.

1498
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,960
Let me farm ults off you.

1499
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,020
Oh, disappear.

1500
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,300
Wait, I hear somebody on the outside.

1501
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,060
Oh, there you are.

1502
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,060
There's some magic, I guess.

1503
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,120
Oh, I fucked up.

1504
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,060
Yeah, I got the Punisher though.

1505
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,180
Oh, shit.

1506
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,160
Oh, I'm alive.

1507
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,080
Oh, you're so low.

1508
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:16,960
I'm so healthy.

1509
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:20,960
I'm okay.

1510
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,400
You can play this game with controller, can't you?

1511
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,020
You can, but there's no aim assist.

1512
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,180
Yeah.

1513
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,260
You can.

1514
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,640
It's just like, there's actually a pro player that plays on controller.

1515
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:32,700
Oh.

1516
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,500
Yeah, he's actually crazy.

1517
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:35,360
I'm scared of him.

1518
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,100
I mean, it makes sense.

1519
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,300
Like, if there's Call of Duty play or something and it just feels more natural.

1520
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:41,820
Yeah.

1521
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,480
No, he was an Overwatch controller player.

1522
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,680
That's what makes him crazy.

1523
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,440
What did he play?

1524
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,800
He was a tank player.

1525
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:50,860
He plays tank.

1526
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:51,980
Oh, okay.

1527
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:52,820
Oh, no.

1528
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,100
Oh, I'm invisible and I'm alive.

1529
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,800
I don't know what I'm cooking.

1530
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,180
Aha!

1531
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:01,720
Aha!

1532
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:03,840
Aha!

1533
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,100
Give me your ult.

1534
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:05,700
Give me your ult.

1535
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,340
Give me your ult charge.

1536
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,020
Judge!

1537
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,000
Jury!

1538
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:11,960
Executioner!

1539
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,620
He was trying to...

1540
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,240
Oh, shit.

1541
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,180
He was trying to find me.

1542
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,300
Oh, I used it.

1543
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,200
The Punisher.

1544
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,100
I went invisible in front of him and he instantly 180'd.

1545
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,180
He was like...

1546
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,980
He thought I was behind him.

1547
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,840
And I just thought I was looking at him in front of me.

1548
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,960
He was like, oh my god, bro, where did she go?

1549
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,240
And I just stood in front of him.

1550
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,980
It's like the mind...

1551
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,180
Mind games.

1552
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:41,900
Yeah, mind games.

1553
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,140
Yeah, I'm here to fuck with him.

1554
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,980
Mental warfare.

1555
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,620
The mental warfare.

1556
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,360
Yeah.

1557
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,060
Oh my god.

1558
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,560
What games have you been mostly playing lately, Doobie?

1559
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,240
Roblox.

1560
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,480
What are your favorite Roblox games?

1561
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,280
Just the dress-up one and the cake one.

1562
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,340
Wait, you just spend your time playing either of those?

1563
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:05,520
Yeah.

1564
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,500
No, I was playing Counter-Strike.

1565
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:08,600
On Roblox?

1566
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,160
Yesterday.

1567
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,440
Or like regular.

1568
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,800
No, not on Roblox.

1569
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,700
Just regular CS2.

1570
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,160
The real one.

1571
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,520
The real one.

1572
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,460
I was like, wait, on Roblox?

1573
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:21,960
No, no.

1574
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,420
Crazy.

1575
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:29,300
There's... have you seen... I guess it's called Murky Divers or something?

1576
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,700
Oh, Murky... yeah, I've always wanted to try Murky Divers.

1577
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,280
Oh, has it been out for a while?

1578
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,360
I thought it just came out.

1579
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:34,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1580
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,240
Yeah, it's been out.

1581
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,280
They've been like... there was like a beta for it.

1582
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:37,980
Oh.

1583
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,400
Why are you trying to...

1584
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,560
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1585
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,160
Thank you.

1586
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,640
I got... I got stuck.

1587
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,980
I'm just gonna be on point real quick.

1588
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:49,320
Fast.

1589
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,200
Yeah.

1590
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,000
Wait, isn't that... that's multiplayer, right?

1591
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,200
Yeah, yeah, there's like eight... up to eight people can play.

1592
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:55,640
Whoa.

1593
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,440
Yeah, I never played it.

1594
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,860
I heard it's like... it's like a little bit like horror-esque type deal too, right?

1595
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,340
Yeah.

1596
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,020
Okay, break this thing.

1597
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,280
I think it's kind of like Weeple Company a little bit.

1598
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:04,800
Oh.

1599
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:05,920
Maybe?

1600
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:06,260
I don't know.

1601
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,420
I've always wanted to play it.

1602
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,400
Or it's like... I heard it's really fun.

1603
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,840
Because like you're like... you have the potential to die in the water type deal.

1604
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:16,880
Yeah.

1605
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,320
What are you trying to do, Penny?

1606
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,640
Somebody said you were lagging, but I think it passed already.

1607
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,920
It just happens with internet.

1608
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,040
Oh, yeah.

1609
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:25,880
Did you fix your internet?

1610
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,620
Um... kind of.

1611
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,120
I think something was wrong with the cables, but...

1612
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,800
Oh, is it a cable thing?

1613
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,400
Sometimes it still drops.

1614
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,160
Yeah, I think so.

1615
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,600
Not my cables.

1616
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,380
It's like, I guess...

1617
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,240
It's just like ISP cables type deal.

1618
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:39,520
Yeah.

1619
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,300
Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.

1620
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,600
Oh, I didn't actually press E.

1621
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,140
That's alright.

1622
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,300
I just got like a satellite backup internet, but I haven't...

1623
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,320
Oh my god!

1624
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,260
Oh my god!

1625
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,840
He accidentally gripped me!

1626
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,060
He wasn't even trying!

1627
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,380
Oh my god, he wasn't even...

1628
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,820
Sorry, I got like gripped while I was trying to ult.

1629
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:00,800
Gripped?

1630
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:01,560
Yeah, yeah.

1631
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:06,100
The bucket like fucking held me and I was just like, oh my god.

1632
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,380
He gripped you firmly?

1633
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,800
Yeah, he gripped me hard and I was like, whoa!

1634
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:10,980
Whoa,

1635
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,340
I did not expect that.

1636
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,440
Oh, we win this anyway.

1637
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:17,260
Oh, yeah.

1638
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:18,700
Nice.

1639
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,220
Came back and we won.

1640
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,100
Look at that.

1641
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:24,300
Insane heals.

1642
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,540
Oh, they're talking about you!

1643
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,160
I... I... I don't know about that.

1644
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:28,840
They're talking about you!

1645
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,040
I ran away from most of them.

1646
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,460
What else?

1647
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,960
What else were they talking about?

1648
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,060
Oh, he... There's nobody on point.

1649
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,580
You know, it's the... It's the thought that counts, you know?

1650
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,840
What the fuck?

1651
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,900
Strange, why were you watching?

1652
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,640
The strange was just watching me 1v1 Penny.

1653
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,600
He's like, you... you can deal with it.

1654
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,320
You're the DPS.

1655
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,840
Yeah, that's why I thought the strange was watching me.

1656
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,980
I was like, shoot him!

1657
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,280
Why you don't shoot him?

1658
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,100
I just...

1659
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,080
Wait, he gave up.

1660
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,500
Yeah, or maybe their mouth died.

1661
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,320
I just thought the Psylocke gave up.

1662
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:11,620
Probably.

1663
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,540
Did we win?

1664
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,360
Yeah, we did.

1665
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,620
We got back all the points we lost in two games... in one game.

1666
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,380
Yeah, ranked back up.

1667
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,840
So it's like true tank, me.

1668
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,760
Respecting the 1v1.

1669
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,100
Yeah, yeah.

1670
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,800
I know, but isn't it like...

1671
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,540
You're going into tank, not another DPS.

1672
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:32,920
Yeah, yeah.

1673
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,320
But he wanted the tank to have his 1v1.

1674
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,520
I'm like, that's fucked up.

1675
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,100
That's fucked up, bro.

1676
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,520
Our Mr. Fantastic never died.

1677
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,100
That's crazy.

1678
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,420
Wait, I also never died.

1679
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,040
Okay, but you're a rock.

1680
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,520
Yeah, I got out really fast.

1681
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,740
You can climb, you can dash, you can jump, you can glide.

1682
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,440
Maybe it should be a Rocket 1 trick, because we just won.

1683
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,100
I think there's a correlation there.

1684
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1685
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,040
Don't go to the dark side.

1686
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,300
No, we don't need...

1687
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,660
Doobie, no, we don't need more Rocket Baits, Doobie.

1688
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,140
We have matching banners.

1689
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,500
Oh my god.

1690
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,960
They do, they're 3-stacking.

1691
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,220
DC is better.

1692
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,580
Oh, is that somebody's enemy?

1693
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,420
Yeah, the enemy team.

1694
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:22,720
What is that?

1695
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,000
Their name is literally, DC is better.

1696
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,500
The Holy Bible.

1697
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,240
Oh my god, we have the Holy Bible on our team.

1698
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,060
Is there... is somebody talking in-game?

1699
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:38,640
Yeah, there is.

1700
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:39,940
Oh, okay.

1701
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:40,800
That was a fail.

1702
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,700
I was hearing voices.

1703
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,220
I don't even know.

1704
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,660
I don't like how you don't know who he's talking to.

1705
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah.

1706
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,460
Sometimes it's bugged, like it doesn't show it at all.

1707
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,060
Yeah, it doesn't show.

1708
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,020
I think it's RSXGod.

1709
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,420
I literally muted the first person I saw, and now it's quiet.

1710
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,960
Now it's quiet.

1711
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,980
I have it really low, so I just hear...

1712
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,840
It's like the Snoopy characters.

1713
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,800
The Snoopy adults are like...

1714
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,440
Alright, well if any... nobody's gonna... okay.

1715
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,700
I guess I'll play support.

1716
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,080
It's back to Luna, jail we go.

1717
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,260
Yay!

1718
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:16,620
Yippee!

1719
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,040
I'll never die!

1720
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,780
I mean, you like playing her, right?

1721
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,040
I do, I do.

1722
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,600
I love playing Luna, Snow.

1723
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,120
I saw your schedule art.

1724
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,580
Oh yeah, the Luna, Snow cosplay.

1725
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,800
The one time I had boobs, like...

1726
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:33,740
Oh yeah, I saw that.

1727
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,060
I'm like, god damn, that's a bare boob.

1728
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:38,420
I was like, no, wait a second, I have to do a double take.

1729
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,720
Don't worry, it's not padded, guys.

1730
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,000
It's not a push-up, it's not padded, it's 100% legit.

1731
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,420
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask.

1732
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,620
Well, I mean, it's okay, you don't have to answer, but...

1733
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:52,560
Cause you showed your 3D during the concert.

1734
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1735
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,080
But are you gonna have like an official 3D debut?

1736
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,280
Cause I haven't seen you use it.

1737
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,620
Oh yeah, yeah, that's why I've been waiting for the official.

1738
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,900
I've been like scouting out studios for it too.

1739
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,460
Cause like, people are like, oh, do you have any plans?

1740
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,740
I have no plans yet.

1741
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,620
But no actual concrete plans and stuff.

1742
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,320
I really, really want to do an actual official debut.

1743
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:20,560
Yeah, you should, that'd be cool.

1744
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,900
So then I can actually use the model for stuff, like...

1745
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,940
Like shorts and things?

1746
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:29,140
Yeah, yeah, like your dancing shorts, that's so fun.

1747
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,480
Then you were doing all those like dancing shorts and with the chibi and the main model.

1748
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,820
Yeah, I could see you doing some cute ones, like the cat one.

1749
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the...

1750
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,860
Actually, I was gonna say, you guys could probably reuse like some of the concert stuff.

1751
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,940
Yeah, yeah, no, we were planning to, yeah.

1752
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,520
Sorry I spoiled it.

1753
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:54,240
No, no, I told my chat cause like, one of the things we recorded was literally like me doing Soldier Boy.

1754
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,260
Nice.

1755
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:01,660
I wanted to do it at the concert, but Min was like, we are not doing Soldier Boy at the concert.

1756
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,760
You recorded a whole song?

1757
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,980
No, it was like we were choosing our setlist and the one thing I wanted was Soldier Boy.

1758
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,060
But because I can't... Oh, I was 97, I was not paying attention.

1759
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,020
That's fine.

1760
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:17,940
That's fine.

1761
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,220
Wait, oh, she destroyed the rez.

1762
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:20,820
I was like, what?

1763
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:21,560
Yeah.

1764
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,480
I tried to take it down before she destroyed it, but I guess it didn't let me.

1765
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:29,040
Yeah, but I have a Soldier Boy short.

1766
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,980
I told my chat about it too.

1767
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,620
I was like, Soldier Boy...

1768
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,620
We also did Ganon style.

1769
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,200
Oh, nice.

1770
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,280
Yeah, cause you guys had the glasses, right?

1771
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:39,860
Like, sunglasses?

1772
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:40,260
Or...

1773
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1774
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1775
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,660
Oh my god, our DPS is...

1776
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,020
I don't think they're enjoying the Amplifier.

1777
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:50,440
Okay.

1778
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,160
Oh, we could technically mow her down, but like...

1779
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:01,040
Technically our Iron Man could do something, but he's not going.

1780
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,000
He's just flying around.

1781
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,020
He could have ulted her, but...

1782
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,980
Oh, now there's the ult.

1783
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:07,860
Alright.

1784
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,560
I'm alive.

1785
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,100
Thank god.

1786
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,060
I'm gonna... I guess I'll kill him for us too.

1787
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:15,540
We haven't got the point yet, though.

1788
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,700
Yeah, no, we didn't.

1789
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,900
Oh, we're running triple support.

1790
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,960
Oh, we got it, we got it.

1791
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,620
Who decided to not play DPS?

1792
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,680
Iron Man?

1793
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:24,960
No.

1794
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:25,620
No, no, no.

1795
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:26,760
Oh, wait, no, it's Iron...

1796
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,700
I can do triple support after this, actually.

1797
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,640
That's fine.

1798
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,860
I'm practically being DPS right now.

1799
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:34,860
As Luna.

1800
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:45,300
I think even if you play support, and we have like triple, you'll still do way more damage than a lot of the other supports either on our team or on their team.

1801
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,340
My chat was like, dude, keep your survival magneto up.

1802
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,420
This is... I'm not afraid of gold magnetos.

1803
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,680
The worst is when you hear Iron Man ult and he's like right behind you.

1804
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,580
Oh, yeah, I hate that.

1805
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,920
I've had that happen to me so many times.

1806
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:01,460
That shit...

1807
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,020
Oh, shit.

1808
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,080
Holy Bible.

1809
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:04,720
Oops.

1810
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,260
I should have helped you.

1811
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,640
No idea why.

1812
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,380
Shit.

1813
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,220
Yeah, I can live this, so I'm just gonna...

1814
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:17,500
Oh, tank, why did you just, you know, decide to...

1815
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,160
Alright, here we go.

1816
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,980
Aww, I'm invisible.

1817
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,220
Why is I...

1818
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:22,540
What?

1819
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,840
He doesn't know how to get up!

1820
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,860
I'm... Kurt doesn't know how to get up!

1821
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,500
He's stuck!

1822
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,120
He doesn't know how to...

1823
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,200
I'm watching you, I'm watching you!

1824
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,660
Oh, my God!

1825
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:32,780
Oh, my God!

1826
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,360
Kurt didn't know how to...

1827
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:34,740
Kurt!

1828
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,520
He's here, he's here, he's here.

1829
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,000
He didn't know how to get up!

1830
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,020
What was I watching?

1831
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:53,220
I watched him walk around the...

1832
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,120
Oh, the bottom.

1833
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:59,740
He was stuck in... He was stuck on the bottom for so long!

1834
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,480
He switched to Hulk.

1835
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,120
I think maybe he feels bad, cause he...

1836
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,180
I don't know, maybe he thought he could jump up somehow.

1837
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,300
Have you ever played, um, Paladins?

1838
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,060
Paladins?

1839
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,660
Oh, yeah, I played a little bit.

1840
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1841
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,380
There's, like, a character that's kind of like Groot, but he swings like Spider-Man.

1842
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,260
Yeah, yeah.

1843
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:23,300
That'd be cool if Groot in this game had, like, a kind of, like, a short swing, not crazy like Venom.

1844
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,080
Yeah, yeah, and just, like, swing back up.

1845
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,800
To be fair, that would be so scary, too.

1846
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,580
That would be so fucking scary.

1847
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,100
Yeah, if I just see a giant...

1848
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,300
He's already kind of OP or something.

1849
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,060
Yeah, yeah, if I just see a giant tree just swinging in and be like, I am Groot, I'd be so scared.

1850
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:42,780
Alright.

1851
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,940
Oh, now we don't have any support.

1852
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,220
Wait, what?

1853
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,600
Where did our other support go?

1854
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,400
Oh, we have, we have Adam Warlock.

1855
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:49,900
This should be good.

1856
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be good.

1857
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:51,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1858
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,180
Oh, okay.

1859
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,840
Oh, hey, I can do this.

1860
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,240
I can do this.

1861
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,120
Nice.

1862
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,140
Round of bullshit, let's go.

1863
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,320
Let's go.

1864
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:05,720
Alright, I don't like our Iron Man.

1865
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,040
He's, he's, he might be, like, an ace, but I don't like him.

1866
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,240
But, like, I don't like the stuff he's doing.

1867
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,260
He's just doing his own thing.

1868
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,160
Oh, my God.

1869
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,360
Alright, that's fine.

1870
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,420
Us against the world.

1871
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,020
Oh, my God, he is.

1872
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,880
Come on, Indian team, I know you want to go low-key.

1873
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,240
Come on.

1874
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,700
Oh, my God, I almost have ult.

1875
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,760
Alright, no.

1876
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,180
Liv, please.

1877
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,680
I almost have ult.

1878
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:35,240
Please.

1879
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,260
Jesus Christ, I should have put it further up.

1880
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,040
I should have...

1881
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,280
That literally got the freest ult ever, and I could have...

1882
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,040
Oh, goodbye.

1883
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:47,440
Oh, no.

1884
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:48,420
Goodbye.

1885
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,820
Oh, nice.

1886
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,660
Wait, why did she stack it here?

1887
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,260
Stack it on the point!

1888
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:54,740
Oh, my God!

1889
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,180
Sorry!

1890
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,420
Oh, my God, Doobie, you gotta stack it on the point, Doobie!

1891
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,280
I panicked!

1892
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,300
I'm a tank main now, I don't play support.

1893
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:07,880
Okay, like, as Cloak, you're so strong.

1894
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,600
Your ult is so strong that if you stack it...

1895
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:16,000
If you stack it on point and just do it twice, you... Oh, my God, nice.

1896
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,500
You literally kill everybody.

1897
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,340
Like, nobody dies.

1898
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:25,700
That's how I used to use the ult, but then people told me that you have to use it more, like, defensively for the team since it heals.

1899
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,180
Yeah, yeah, like, uh... Yeah, yeah, when you use it defensively, just go up.

1900
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,600
Go up and then go back once and then, like, you live.

1901
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,900
Because she got the buff where, like, nobody dies now.

1902
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,020
Oh.

1903
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:41,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1904
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,480
So, like, that was old Cloak.

1905
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,240
That was, like, Season 0 Cloak.

1906
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,240
Season 1 Cloak is, like, crazy broken.

1907
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,960
So, like, nobody can die.

1908
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,500
Like, you live through a Punisher ult and a Cloak ult now.

1909
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,360
That's how crazy broken she is.

1910
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,180
Okay.

1911
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,900
Sorry, my ring toxicity almost got out.

1912
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:06,900
Why are you yelling at me?

1913
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,760
It's not yelling, chat.

1914
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,160
It's called character build.

1915
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,440
She's building character.

1916
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,180
I'm getting free coaching.

1917
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:17,600
Yeah.

1918
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:17,680
Yeah.

1919
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,620
Does our Groot have... No.

1920
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,060
Okay.

1921
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,340
Let's do double moons, I guess.

1922
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,300
So they'll think it's their moon.

1923
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:34,600
I almost forget to use my E.

1924
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,600
I haven't played Cl- uh...

1925
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:39,900
It's not fair.

1926
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:40,820
You have a fucking...

1927
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:41,920
It's not fair.

1928
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,300
You have a snowflake!

1929
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,920
It's actually crazy.

1930
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,980
We haven't bumped into a Luna player, too, in our own game.

1931
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,480
On our team?

1932
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:50,760
Yeah.

1933
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:51,380
Yeah, yeah.

1934
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,480
Like, Luna is such a...

1935
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,200
Such a good... Like, the one...

1936
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,540
Like, they all play... Everybody plays...

1937
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,720
The other support players, they play everything but Luna.

1938
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,020
Yeah.

1939
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:01,920
I don't... I don't know.

1940
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:02,880
I don't like playing her.

1941
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:04,440
Like, she feels...

1942
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,020
Like, I miss my shots, I guess.

1943
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,420
Yeah, she has a high skill ceiling.

1944
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:12,940
Because you have to require aim and stuff.

1945
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,720
But it's just weird because, like, the enemy team has Cloak.

1946
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:16,660
Yeah.

1947
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,300
And not Luna.

1948
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:17,780
Not Cloak.

1949
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:18,180
Luna.

1950
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,060
Luna, yeah.

1951
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:20,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1952
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,120
How do I still have... Oh, my God.

1953
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,020
I have the most damage.

1954
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,360
It's okay.

1955
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:24,960
Nice.

1956
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,360
It's okay.

1957
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,520
We're just... We're still warming up, guys.

1958
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,500
We're still...

1959
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,040
Yeah.

1960
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,720
Guys, we're still warming up.

1961
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:35,820
It's okay.

1962
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,780
It's like we win-lose, win-lose, win-lose.

1963
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,980
Oh, that's, like, the worst part.

1964
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,060
That's the worst part.

1965
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:44,680
I once had, like... I once had, like, an actual Zebra record.

1966
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:50,280
For, like, the entire page was just win-lose, win-lose, win-lose, win-lose.

1967
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,300
Like, I was going crazy.

1968
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,400
I was crashing out.

1969
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,740
What rank was that?

1970
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,080
It was... Yeah, it was one above all.

1971
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,440
It was literally win-lose, win-lose, win-lose, win-lose.

1972
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:04,700
And I was playing with, like... I was trioing, too.

1973
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,160
So, it was crazy.

1974
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,760
Like, we would have the easiest games when we're winning.

1975
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,060
And the most fucked-up, hard-ass games when we lose.

1976
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,340
I was like, why can't we have it twice?

1977
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,520
I think I would give up.

1978
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:20,700
Oh, no.

1979
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,760
I was crashing out.

1980
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,760
The only reason why I kept going was because...

1981
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:31,840
Was because I had to end in top 500, so I, like, was forced to keep going.

1982
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,580
I just... I had to...

1983
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,340
I had to get in.

1984
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:37,400
You played, like, nine hours or something?

1985
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,420
I played for, like...

1986
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,820
I played for, like, 14 plus hours.

1987
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,760
And, like, this was off-stream, too.

1988
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,880
This was off-stream.

1989
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:47,020
And I was just, like...

1990
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:49,400
I was so desperate.

1991
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,700
I was just, like...

1992
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,200
I was literally, like...

1993
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,900
Because, like, I thought I was safe.

1994
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,280
You know, like, when you think you're safe, but you're not.

1995
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,260
And then you...

1996
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,540
Because I got close to... I thought I was in a safe area.

1997
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,080
And so, I was like, okay, I don't have to play for the next three...

1998
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,020
The next couple of days.

1999
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,240
And then, oh my god, we just have DPS players.

2000
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,820
That's good, that's good.

2001
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,280
So, we both played for...

2002
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:13,980
Yeah, yeah.

2003
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,140
And then...

2004
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:20,240
And then, like, on the last day, we found out that I was absolutely not safe.

2005
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,760
So, I just had to...

2006
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,520
I just...

2007
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,060
Grind.

2008
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:23,780
Grind.

2009
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:25,420
I just kept...

2010
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:27,140
And then, the worst part was afterwards.

2011
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:29,060
I had to...

2012
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,020
I had to, like...

2013
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:32,180
I had a stream.

2014
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:36,040
And I had to go to the passport office to take a picture.

2015
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,420
And get my passport renewed.

2016
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:41,680
And I picked up the passport, like, two days ago.

2017
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,180
And, um...

2018
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,460
The photo is, like, post-Marvel...

2019
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,580
And that's gonna be...

2020
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,880
Yeah, like, dark circles under your eyes.

2021
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:53,080
Yeah, that's gonna be my photo for the next ten years.

2022
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:56,360
And it's, like, post-Marvel rivals rank grind.

2023
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,560
I mean, it's a fun time.

2024
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,440
Now you'll remember the good memories forever.

2025
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,700
Yeah, yeah.

2026
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,340
Great memories.

2027
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,660
My, like...

2028
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,760
Okay, let's see.

2029
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,420
I got my passport photo taken at, like, a...

2030
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,640
Like, a pharmacy.

2031
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:14,120
Yeah.

2032
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,940
And they just had a really shitty digital camera.

2033
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,560
Like, one of those snapshot ones.

2034
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,040
From, like, 2003.

2035
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:21,960
Uh-huh.

2036
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:24,580
And the picture came out so bad.

2037
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,840
Whenever I go through airport security, they're like, Are you sure this is you?

2038
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:28,920
Is this you?

2039
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,380
And I'm like, yeah, it was a really bad picture.

2040
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,620
And they're, like, laughing at my picture.

2041
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,100
They're just like...

2042
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:35,800
Thanks.

2043
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,000
How long do you have to keep your passport for?

2044
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:40,920
Yeah, it's also ten years.

2045
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,580
That's your legacy.

2046
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,260
That's gonna be...

2047
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,480
Maybe I'll lose it.

2048
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,300
You'll lose it and be like, whoops, gotta renew my passport.

2049
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,020
Alright, yes.

2050
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,500
Oh my god.

2051
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,540
I remember back then.

2052
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,340
Back then, you can, like, Photoshop your photos too.

2053
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:00,320
Back then.

2054
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2055
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:08,120
I think there's, like, some countries where they let you put, like, beauty filters on your passport.

2056
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:08,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2057
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,460
Okay, so, like, when I got my passport renewed out of country, they do not have, like, photo regulations.

2058
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,320
Because it's, like, you know, it's just the embassy that's doing your photo.

2059
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,160
So they didn't care.

2060
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:26,840
And then, like, I think, like, my mom did, like, a beauty filter for her photo.

2061
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,340
Because they didn't care.

2062
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,400
I already had my own.

2063
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,920
I was not paying attention.

2064
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,100
Nice.

2065
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:36,800
Look at that.

2066
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,240
Wow, this game is so easy.

2067
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,540
Hey, Rocket Raccoon.

2068
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:43,000
What you doing outside your home, Rocket Raccoon?

2069
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,000
What you doing outside?

2070
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,120
Alright.

2071
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,200
Oh, he missed.

2072
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:48,980
He actually missed.

2073
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,300
Alright, go kill him.

2074
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:50,680
Oh, no.

2075
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,620
Go kill them.

2076
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,980
Yes, go, Magneto, go!

2077
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,100
There's somebody behind.

2078
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:56,380
Oh.

2079
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:57,480
Who is it?

2080
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,060
Who's behind?

2081
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,220
Oh, no.

2082
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,080
I got him.

2083
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,620
I got him for you.

2084
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,220
Nice.

2085
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:04,840
You might have died, but I got revenge for you.

2086
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:06,240
That's fine.

2087
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,320
Our Mag is so healthy.

2088
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,440
Look, he's alive.

2089
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:16,340
Oh, here there's a thing where, um, if you have, like, a religion, like, you can take a picture for your passport or ID.

2090
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,120
Like, wearing whatever your religion thing is.

2091
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,480
Oh, that's interesting.

2092
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:23,960
Yeah, some people wear, like, a colander to take their picture.

2093
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,300
Because they're, like, apostapharian.

2094
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, like the spaghetti monster.

2095
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:31,400
Yeah, yeah.

2096
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:35,060
Wait, like, is that actually a registered religion?

2097
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,780
Yeah, you can have one official.

2098
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:38,260
Wait, really?

2099
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,220
I thought it was, like, a meme.

2100
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,400
I didn't realize it was an actual registered religion.

2101
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,760
I mean, I don't know if they check.

2102
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,920
Maybe it does have to be registered.

2103
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,720
Probably chat knows.

2104
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,160
I feel like, apparently, it's not hard to start a church or religion.

2105
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,460
Unless you try to start a VTuber.

2106
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,060
Like, you just need a place of worship.

2107
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,580
I watched a video of a guy that started a religion for his, like, a church slash religion for a YouTube channel.

2108
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:08,020
And also for, like, and it's, like, recognized by the government and stuff and, like, you can get, like, tax breaks and stuff from it.

2109
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:13,300
Which is absolutely crazy that you can get tax breaks from a random religion you start.

2110
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,220
Yeah.

2111
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,580
That's why most people do it now, I think.

2112
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:19,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2113
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,600
So, like, for tax reasons, yeah.

2114
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:22,580
And then, like...

2115
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:23,760
Wow, we should totally start...

2116
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,180
Oh my god, we should start a YouTube... a VTuber.

2117
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,860
Definitely very legal in my eyes.

2118
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,920
I mean, we already take donations, so...

2119
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,680
Yeah, exactly.

2120
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,860
Like, you can say SuperChat is, like, a donation to the church, you know?

2121
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:39,860
Like...

2122
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,900
I think we are not gonna be okay.

2123
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,680
Actually, we are.

2124
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,820
I'm scheming.

2125
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,980
Rocket Raccoon, what are you doing, Rocket Raccoon?

2126
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:50,540
You're throwing.

2127
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,400
What are you... Oh, your Bucky saved your life.

2128
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,800
Let's finally win it.

2129
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,860
Alright, so basically...

2130
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,920
To start a religion, you just... you literally just need a place of worship.

2131
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,060
And then, like, a place of worship and, like, people have... you have to give, like, service.

2132
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,420
Like, sermons and stuff at the place of worship.

2133
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,720
And then, that's how you make a religion.

2134
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,380
And you just apply... like, do, like, an application and the government just has to recognize it.

2135
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,500
And then, a YouTuber did it and he just... he was, like... he did it for, like, one week and disbanded it after that.

2136
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,660
Oh, just to see if he could do it.

2137
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,620
Yeah, see if he could do it.

2138
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,200
Yeah, and it got recognized by the...

2139
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,120
It got recognized by the British government.

2140
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,460
I pranked the government.

2141
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:49,580
So, if all the VTubers work together and, like, buy a church, we can make a religion.

2142
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,560
And then, we'll run it as a venue for a virtual concert.

2143
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,320
Yeah, exactly.

2144
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,820
And then, like, our sermons will be, like, virtual concerts and, like...

2145
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:04,580
We can put a laptop, like, a giant screen and then, like, we can live stream into it and those are our sermons.

2146
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,580
And we just do it every Sunday.

2147
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,460
We can make it for a day.

2148
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,080
It doesn't have to be a Sunday.

2149
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,460
Oh, true.

2150
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,240
It doesn't have to be a Sunday, but then...

2151
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:12,420
Saturday night party.

2152
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:18,520
We can make it, like... We can make it, like, a Monday and then say... and then make it, like, a religious holiday, so, like, the...

2153
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,220
So, your work... you can be like, I'm sorry, I have to go to... I have to go to church on Monday.

2154
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,260
We have a special event.

2155
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:24,620
There you go.

2156
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:29,920
We're cookie right now.

2157
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,860
Write it down, guys.

2158
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,400
Write it down.

2159
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,380
My next project, I'm gonna start a church.

2160
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,100
I'm gonna get sponsored.

2161
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,020
I believe it if you say it.

2162
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,300
I'm gonna get spon... I'm gonna ask GamerSupps to sponsor it.

2163
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,800
Instead of going up to drink from the cup of wine, you drink from the...

2164
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,800
GamerSupps cup of...

2165
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,380
Oh, yeah.

2166
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,440
Oh, my God, that's wild.

2167
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,980
A cup of GamerSupps.

2168
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:55,140
You're so bad.

2169
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,540
Black Panther, you're so bad.

2170
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,680
I, like, instantly froze him.

2171
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,840
I am the counter dive.

2172
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,640
He's back.

2173
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,880
Oh, he is back.

2174
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,740
He had the res.

2175
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:13,970
Oh, my God.

2176
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:17,450
And then, like, you use the cup of waifu every time.

2177
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:21,050
And then, like, what would be, like, the...

2178
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:24,710
And then... Oh, no, you get baptized in the...

2179
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:27,050
You get baptized in the GamerSupps.

2180
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:30,230
It becomes, like...

2181
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:31,050
It becomes...

2182
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:39,330
Are you truly dedicated to the church of YouTubers if you don't get baptized in the pool of GamerSupps?

2183
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:40,890
You get to pick your flavor, though, at least.

2184
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:41,430
In the hot tub.

2185
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:42,510
Yeah.

2186
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:46,330
But, hey, you get to pick your flavor.

2187
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:47,510
Isn't that the best part?

2188
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:48,970
Wait, do you have a flavor?

2189
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:49,870
No.

2190
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:55,810
But, like, when you get baptized, you get to pick the flavor you want to be baptized in.

2191
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:57,890
Where?

2192
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,210
Where did he Grooted?

2193
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,970
This Groot is so weird.

2194
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:02,710
I'm not sure.

2195
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,410
Like, I don't know where he Grooted.

2196
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:06,230
Where?

2197
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,090
Like, where is the Bucky going?

2198
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:12,210
There's somebody behind, buddy.

2199
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,050
Oh, it's Rocket.

2200
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:14,110
It is?

2201
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:15,990
Yeah, he was just stalling on point.

2202
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,330
Oh, I might be dead.

2203
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:21,930
Oh, no, I got hit by the tree!

2204
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:24,450
I got hit by the tree!

2205
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:25,530
What the?

2206
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:28,450
No, their Bucky is pretty decent.

2207
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:29,470
Yeah.

2208
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:32,990
He, like, one or two-shot me.

2209
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:34,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2210
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,250
Wait, what?

2211
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:36,790
Why did he...

2212
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:37,110
Okay.

2213
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:39,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2214
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:40,310
Try it.

2215
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:41,510
Oh, wait, dude, he did kill the tank.

2216
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:42,930
Okay, I didn't realize there's Psylocke.

2217
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,010
But, King ran off of it.

2218
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,470
I was like, yeah, kill the tank.

2219
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,290
Jesus, their Bucky is carrying.

2220
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,110
Alright, I'm just...

2221
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:54,490
Hey, Bucky.

2222
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:55,830
Oh, my God.

2223
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:56,450
Alright.

2224
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:01,950
I saw there was, like, a hack where somebody was playing Rocket and they were doing clean damage.

2225
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:02,250
Oh, yeah!

2226
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,090
Yes!

2227
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,550
That's crazy!

2228
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:06,950
And how did they even do that?

2229
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:08,870
That is the crazy hack.

2230
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:12,410
Like, I'm like... I actually want to know where he got that.

2231
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:15,910
That's such a crazy thing to do.

2232
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:19,150
Hello, fucking Cloco.

2233
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:21,450
How many odds?

2234
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:22,710
They used everything.

2235
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:23,430
They used everything.

2236
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:24,330
Oh, my God.

2237
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:25,550
They used everything.

2238
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:26,350
Holy shit.

2239
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:27,110
They wasted it.

2240
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:27,710
They wasted it.

2241
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,510
Yeah, they used, like, four ults.

2242
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:31,150
That was crazy.

2243
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:32,350
I was not...

2244
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,790
Okay, we're wasting four ults.

2245
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:36,590
We're wasting four ults.

2246
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:38,230
That's alright.

2247
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,730
That's fine.

2248
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,190
We still have Rocket.

2249
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,570
We still have my ult and then we still have Moon Knight ult.

2250
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,270
I'm just surprised that...

2251
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:51,810
Because we definitely did not need to use some of these ults.

2252
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:53,410
Yeah.

2253
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:56,650
It's fine.

2254
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:57,350
I survived.

2255
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:59,630
He headshot me, but I lived.

2256
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:02,110
Oh, it's fine.

2257
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:04,490
There's a Black Panther on point.

2258
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:06,570
Just focus on the Black Panther on point.

2259
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:07,450
I guess.

2260
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:09,730
Can I put a rez on the freaking...

2261
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:10,090
Please.

2262
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:12,350
Please, just shoot him.

2263
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:12,970
Please.

2264
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:16,730
If there's a rez here, I'm shooting the rez so that we...

2265
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,170
I got the Rocket.

2266
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:18,570
Please.

2267
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:19,910
Sorry, I killed them.

2268
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:23,570
Final score.

2269
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:25,030
1-2-0.

2270
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:25,790
Alright.

2271
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:28,890
I was gonna say more kills on our DPS, but pretty much...

2272
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:29,890
Oh my god.

2273
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,870
Yeah, we have...

2274
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,450
We have more kills than her.

2275
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:35,510
We have a better KDA than her Iron Fist.

2276
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:36,950
Oh my god.

2277
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:40,530
We're about to overlap the Iron Fist's KDA.

2278
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:42,330
Well, that's me.

2279
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,650
I can play Luna on autopilot.

2280
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:45,530
I actually...

2281
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,050
You played her so much, yeah.

2282
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:54,050
Yeah, when you play a character so much, you can legitimately just have a conversation while playing, because...

2283
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:56,430
It's just autopilot for me.

2284
01:31:56,790 --> 01:32:00,110
That's how I feel with Cloak and Dagger, especially because you don't really have to aim.

2285
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:03,870
Yeah, it's just brain off, just chillin' type deal.

2286
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:07,450
I can play another game while I'm playing this game.

2287
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:09,690
Just Cloak and Dagger?

2288
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:13,310
Just have Bloons on the side?

2289
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:15,690
Pretty much, yeah.

2290
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:19,690
Alright, let's see.

2291
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:23,450
Oh, we have our very first Luna player.

2292
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:24,810
Oh my god.

2293
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:30,510
Oh, I just thought about that you're pretty much boosting me.

2294
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:32,910
No, because I played DPS.

2295
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:34,750
I played DPS.

2296
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:35,750
It's okay.

2297
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:38,270
It's not boosting, because I'm bad at DPS.

2298
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:41,030
I'm also bad at DPS when I'm streaming.

2299
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:45,550
Legitimately, I don't focus a lot.

2300
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,410
So in the end, I'm not boosting.

2301
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,010
I'm actually throwing your games.

2302
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:54,590
Yeah, I mean, you're like top 500 support player, but as a DPS, you're just like a diamond or something.

2303
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,510
Yeah, exactly.

2304
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,290
It's fine.

2305
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,550
I'm legitimately just... Oh my god!

2306
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:00,450
Oh my god, Nimi!

2307
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:02,050
Thank you for the raid!

2308
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:02,890
Thank you!

2309
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:03,930
Hello, Nimi!

2310
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:05,390
Hello!

2311
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:06,930
We had a good stream.

2312
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:09,510
I saw she was playing that... was it a horror game earlier?

2313
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:10,150
I saw that.

2314
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:11,750
Which one?

2315
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:12,850
I don't know.

2316
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:16,150
It was something about choosing if you want to be a human or not.

2317
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:17,050
I didn't read the title.

2318
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,070
I saw the thumbnail.

2319
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:18,990
I was like, that's freaky.

2320
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:22,190
Freaky?

2321
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,470
That's freaky.

2322
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:25,090
I'm so bad at horror games.

2323
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:28,030
But no, no, no.

2324
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:30,250
I really can't do VR horror games.

2325
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:30,990
Those must be up.

2326
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,690
Oh my god.

2327
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:34,630
No, I remember I tried to play... What was that?

2328
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:35,910
One of the scariest horror games?

2329
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:38,390
The one that was like PT.

2330
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:42,690
I don't know the name.

2331
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:43,990
I don't remember the name either.

2332
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:47,550
It's like... I forgot what it was called.

2333
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:51,850
I swear to god, if I see another Black Panther, I swear to god, I'm going to go to Wakanda.

2334
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:55,070
No, they don't have one.

2335
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:55,930
Good.

2336
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:59,010
I was going to go to Wakanda and something was going to happen in Wakanda.

2337
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:00,850
I will find him.

2338
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:03,410
Oh, Visage.

2339
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:04,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2340
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:04,470
Visage.

2341
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:05,150
No, I cannot.

2342
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:06,270
Oh, yeah.

2343
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,120
Heaven Factory was kind of scary when I played it.

2344
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,960
It was a really short one.

2345
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,160
Yeah, I thought it was.

2346
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,660
I heard like... But it was so short though.

2347
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,700
How was it scary?

2348
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:30,600
It's because... So it's like a cabin comes out on the conveyor belt and then sometimes it's haunted, but then sometimes it's not.

2349
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,380
Yeah, so what were some of the haunted things?

2350
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,920
There's like a portrait on the wall and you go through the cabin a bunch of times and nothing's weird with it.

2351
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,560
But then in one instance, like the portrait turns and it's like following you.

2352
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:48,700
And then in one instance, you see it, it's normal.

2353
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,260
And then as you turn around instead of a portrait...

2354
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:53,420
Because it's a portrait of a woman in like a really long dress.

2355
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,820
And then she's just standing there staring at you instead of like in the portrait.

2356
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,980
She's like... Her whole body appears.

2357
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,340
Yeah, yeah.

2358
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,600
I don't like that.

2359
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,640
That's so freaky.

2360
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,680
I'm so bad.

2361
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:09,600
Like I once like... When I tried to play Visage, I legitimately... I got drunk.

2362
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,740
Because I was like...

2363
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,660
You thought it would help?

2364
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:13,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2365
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,820
It's like liquid courage, you know?

2366
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,280
I got drunk and then I didn't... Okay, my chat knows about this because I told this story before.

2367
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:23,220
And then like... I didn't... Have you ever played Visage?

2368
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,000
No, I don't think so.

2369
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:28,660
Okay, so there's... The thing they didn't tell you is that...

2370
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:31,800
The first part is a level select.

2371
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,420
So it's not even like... You don't get in the game.

2372
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:38,740
But I didn't know that because you're like walking around the house.

2373
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,060
But you're supposed to pick up items to like... Start the game.

2374
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,060
So I was stuck in there for like an hour plus.

2375
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:49,240
Because I was just like... Oh my god, I'm so scared.

2376
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,020
When does the monster come out?

2377
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,580
When does the ghost come out?

2378
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,860
And then I found out after an hour and a half.

2379
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,820
My chat was like... You're in the level select.

2380
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,320
You gotta pick up an item.

2381
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:02,960
And I was like freaking the fuck out.

2382
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,260
And then the moment I picked up the item, I just... I couldn't.

2383
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,960
It was actually... It got bad.

2384
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,040
It was so bad.

2385
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,160
It's so... It was like... Oh, I lost track of where the fucking wall was.

2386
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,660
That sounds confusing though.

2387
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
I think I'd probably get it confused too.

2388
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:21,980
Goodbye.

2389
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,420
Oh my god, I'm dead.

2390
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,960
Oh, I'm so dead.

2391
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,700
I thought I had the snowflake still.

2392
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,680
That's fine.

2393
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:35,300
And then like, I couldn't... And then I picked up the level, technically.

2394
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,680
And then after that, I like...

2395
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,020
I couldn't do it, so I looked up a YouTube video of the first level.

2396
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:45,600
I was like, let's watch.

2397
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,800
Hey guys, let's pretend to play the game, guys.

2398
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:52,960
But even then, I was so freaked... I was so scared even then.

2399
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,020
Even when I was like pretending to...

2400
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,940
Pretending to play it, I was still scared.

2401
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,560
Oh my god.

2402
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:02,140
Oh, okay.

2403
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:02,860
That's cool.

2404
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,580
I got three though.

2405
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:05,440
I got three kills.

2406
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,840
We win this easily.

2407
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:08,820
Now I'm gonna play Starlord.

2408
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,280
Nice.

2409
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,020
I'm just gonna play Starlord and fly over.

2410
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:19,940
Anyway, I'm supposed to... I'm actually supposed to play Visage like this year because it's a charity goal.

2411
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:20,860
But like...

2412
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:21,420
Oh, nice.

2413
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,400
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna drink for it.

2414
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:26,400
I can't.

2415
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:27,500
I can't play it sober.

2416
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,980
Hey, oh my god!

2417
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,360
It's gonna be our second win in a row, Doobie!

2418
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,060
We break the streak!

2419
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,080
We're gonna do it!

2420
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,180
I'm so proud of us.

2421
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,880
All it took was just not focusing on the game.

2422
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,040
Just playing mindlessly, yeah?

2423
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:59,160
Yeah, just not even... We're not even focused on the game anymore.

2424
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:04,140
I feel like if I played in a stack or something...

2425
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:07,840
Well, maybe it's just a problem with players in the game, but...

2426
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,940
Even when communicating, it takes a lot of brain power.

2427
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:12,500
Yeah.

2428
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:14,160
It does.

2429
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,960
For Stylok, I legitimately... I'm not even thinking.

2430
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,480
I'm just mindlessly shooting my hands.

2431
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,020
I just go pew pew pew pew.

2432
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:28,420
Do you usually like... I know in Overwatch, the supports usually show colors.

2433
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:29,220
Yeah.

2434
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,740
Is it the same for this game too?

2435
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,720
It's the tanks.

2436
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:32,940
It's the tanks.

2437
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,040
It's not even the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2438
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:40,160
Which is a lot different, because the tanks control the ults and stuff.

2439
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,300
So they know when to do the ults and everything.

2440
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,580
So usually the tanks are the IGLs for this game.

2441
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,180
Which is a lot different.

2442
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:53,460
I think it's like... I mean, the support helps out too.

2443
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,700
But it's not like... They're not the main shot caller.

2444
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,940
They do like... They mostly do like ults.

2445
01:38:59,140 --> 01:38:59,660
Ult tracking?

2446
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:00,720
Ult tracking, yeah.

2447
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,360
Man, thank you again for the raid, Nini!

2448
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:04,880
I hope you had a great stream!

2449
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,900
I heard Nini is like really good at like MOBAs.

2450
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,300
Oh?

2451
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:15,360
Yes.

2452
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:20,520
Have you played MOBAs?

2453
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:24,620
No, I'm so... I refuse to play League.

2454
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:28,380
You should play Heroes of the Storm.

2455
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,420
Oh, Heroes of... Wait, is that still alive?

2456
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,500
Is that game still alive?

2457
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:33,580
Wait, I'm so surprised.

2458
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,600
I'm actually surprised Heroes of the Storm is still alive.

2459
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:38,840
What the fuck?

2460
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:42,840
Yeah, I don't like playing League of Legends, but I think Heroes of the Storm is really fun.

2461
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:47,140
I've never played... I've never played League before.

2462
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,420
I mean, I played it once like years ago.

2463
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,560
Oh my god, you're so bad, Storm.

2464
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:53,980
I clearly...

2465
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,760
Okay, I might die doing this, but like...

2466
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:58,640
Nope.

2467
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,160
I'm fine.

2468
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:01,500
Alright, kill two.

2469
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,940
We should be able to move up now.

2470
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
They don't have a support anymore.

2471
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:05,960
I have Rocket.

2472
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:06,860
Oh no, is that Rocket?

2473
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:07,540
They had Rocket.

2474
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,500
They had Rocket.

2475
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,140
Oh.

2476
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,560
Yeah, yeah.

2477
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,700
Alright, I know how to play Sidelock again.

2478
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,420
I figured it out.

2479
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:22,280
You just had to warm up, yeah?

2480
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:22,820
Yeah, yeah.

2481
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,760
It just took me like a couple of hours, you know?

2482
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,940
It took me a couple of hours to warm up.

2483
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:30,320
What the fuck are you doing?

2484
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:31,180
Whoa!

2485
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,040
Alright.

2486
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:33,940
I guess you're gonna do that.

2487
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,140
Did they ult?

2488
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,360
No, he was just like chilling.

2489
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,940
But like...

2490
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,120
Oh, hello, Sharkboy.

2491
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:43,960
Hello!

2492
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,820
What are you trying to do, Sharkboy?

2493
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:48,740
That's fine.

2494
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,740
I have ult here.

2495
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,200
Alright, yeah, get in this point.

2496
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,120
Oh, easy.

2497
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,640
Oh my god, the hella god damn play.

2498
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,420
She literally got to play a game in one second.

2499
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:00,820
Really?

2500
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:06,960
I tabbed, I was ace, and then I just saw my ace go away the moment we won.

2501
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,440
Did she get it?

2502
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,320
I guess she would've got it.

2503
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:12,640
Yeah, like what did you do?

2504
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,360
Oh, she had more damage, nevermind.

2505
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,820
She had more damage.

2506
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,520
Did you rank up?

2507
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,020
Yeah, I just...

2508
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:21,560
Yippee!

2509
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,520
I'm the rank that we started with.

2510
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,440
Wait, you ranked down?

2511
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,820
Yeah, we lost like two games.

2512
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:34,060
I didn't know, I thought you were flat.

2513
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:35,940
No, no.

2514
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,460
I de-ranked the gold too, and then...

2515
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,560
Okay, alright, don't worry.

2516
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,560
I just ranked back up.

2517
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,680
We'll get you there.

2518
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,160
You'll boost me?

2519
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:48,020
No, no, no, we're gonna play well to get there.

2520
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,980
Right, right, right, right.

2521
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:53,700
It doesn't count, because you're not playing support.

2522
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,220
You're right, because I'm boosting myself, because I win.

2523
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:02,140
I'm boosting myself.

2524
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:03,000
Oh my god.

2525
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,540
Lord Hawkeye, that's crazy.

2526
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,880
Don't worry, I've remembered how to play Psylocke now.

2527
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:16,580
Hey, at least one of us is climbing, you know?

2528
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,460
Wait, you mean you and not me?

2529
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,260
It's better if at least not both of us are losing, you know?

2530
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,460
One of us is climbing.

2531
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,140
Wait, does that happen, like you're getting more points than me?

2532
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,800
MVPs get more points.

2533
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:39,180
Yeah, that's why DPS players climb so much, because it's so easy to get MVP.

2534
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:40,320
Oh, yeah.

2535
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,020
I didn't know that.

2536
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:46,280
Oh yeah, but like, I've always wanted to try Heroes of the Storm.

2537
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:47,920
We should do it.

2538
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:48,860
Heroes of the Storm?

2539
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,360
Yeah, we should play it.

2540
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:50,260
I really like it.

2541
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:53,520
We should do Mimi and then...

2542
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,820
How many players are in Heroes of the Storm?

2543
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:56,920
Five, I think.

2544
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:57,220
Five?

2545
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,240
Yeah.

2546
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,760
I'm willing to do Heroes of the Storm because they're Starcraft characters and I love Starcraft.

2547
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:02,540
Yeah, yeah.

2548
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:03,800
And Overwatch characters.

2549
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,100
Oh yeah, that's true!

2550
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,720
There's Tracer too, right?

2551
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,720
Yeah, but they kind of suck.

2552
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,940
Yeah, yeah, you can teach us.

2553
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:12,940
Except Lucio.

2554
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,480
Lucio's really good in Heroes of the Storm.

2555
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,920
Who are the best characters in Heroes of the Storm?

2556
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,920
I'm just surprised there's still a player base.

2557
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Yeah, well, it's like a game that's been around for a while has like a dedicated player base, but then you find somebody that has...

2558
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,880
They're like level 500 or something crazy.

2559
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,980
Oh, true, true.

2560
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,720
I don't know who the best are.

2561
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:41,820
People always play this one character, Abathur, where he just sits in the back of the map and he has like a little parasite that sticks onto other players.

2562
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:42,680
Oh.

2563
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:43,940
Yeah.

2564
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,760
Well, that sounds broken.

2565
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:51,440
Yeah, and I thought for the longest time, I thought that like people who played him were just AFK because they just sit and spawn.

2566
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,420
Where's my team?

2567
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,580
I'm on point.

2568
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,140
No, no, where's our Captain America?

2569
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,680
No, look at our Captain America.

2570
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,760
Wait, I think he DC'd.

2571
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:05,540
Our Captain America DC'd!

2572
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,200
Is he like...

2573
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:09,280
No, look at him!

2574
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,600
Oh, he's walking into the wall.

2575
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,780
No, he's not even walking, he's just...

2576
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:18,100
Oh, wait, is it one minute?

2577
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:21,100
If it's one minute, the game cancelled.

2578
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:21,720
Yay!

2579
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:23,460
Oh, okay.

2580
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,160
Yay, not punished!

2581
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,680
Yeah, we kind of had a bad start anyway, so this works out.

2582
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:32,520
Let's go!

2583
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:36,200
I'm so happy, never punished, guys.

2584
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:37,680
That's the best part.

2585
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:39,980
Saved.

2586
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:40,300
Yeah.

2587
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:45,040
Oh my god, game queued longer than five seconds, the game's dead.

2588
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:51,460
Oh yeah, I have... I wanted to show you something.

2589
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:51,980
Oh yeah?

2590
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:55,340
Oh, because I saw your tweet, I was like, there's two doobies.

2591
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,080
Oh, there's two doobies?

2592
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:03,880
I wanted to show receipts because I had this... I'll send this picture to you so you can verify.

2593
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:05,000
Wait.

2594
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,540
I remember when I saw you debut, I was like, what the hell are designs?

2595
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:16,020
Because I'd never seen your design before.

2596
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:24,680
So I was like, I was already in the process of designing Doobie, and so I was like, damn, it's kind of similar.

2597
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:30,900
Blondes, blondes with green eyes, short hair.

2598
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,140
And then the hat is similar too, and I'm like, shoot.

2599
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,080
But then I saw you were getting a redesign, and I was like, oh, okay.

2600
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:38,620
That was fun.

2601
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:41,280
And then it looks even more similar.

2602
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,860
Kind of, a little bit.

2603
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:50,740
I even told my artist, I was like, I'm nervous, can we try not to get the hair...

2604
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,820
Just change the color a little different, you know?

2605
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,040
Yeah, yeah.

2606
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:01,400
I told him, I was like, no, you know, be careful with the ahegao, the hair.

2607
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,700
The little cowlick.

2608
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:03,260
Yeah.

2609
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:18,460
I had someone, I think it was my New Year's stream, someone in my chat came in during New Year's, I think he was drunk, and he was super chatting me and being like, oh my god, I'm so happy to have you here, Doobie.

2610
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:22,040
And I was like, yeah, Doobie?

2611
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:27,680
And he kept super chatting me, he was like, oh man, Doobie, this is what a great stream.

2612
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:32,660
Yeah.

2613
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:37,940
I had already picked the name out, so I was like, oh, this is kind of similar.

2614
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:38,980
Doobie and Dookie.

2615
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:39,740
Yeah.

2616
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:40,880
D&D.

2617
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:42,880
Oh, that's a good name.

2618
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:43,720
Yeah, that's a good name.

2619
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,120
I saw people asking, like, what's the collab name, Dookie?

2620
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:47,720
And I'm like, I'm not gonna respond.

2621
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:50,200
D&D is way better.

2622
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,080
D &D is so good, yeah, I like D&D.

2623
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,820
Oh, apparently I said the wrong word, it's, what is it?

2624
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,040
It's not ahegao.

2625
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:03,900
I don't want to say it too, because I know it's, I'm scared too.

2626
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,120
Wait, what is the prop ahoge?

2627
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,200
They sound really similar.

2628
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:09,880
They do, they sound so similar, like...

2629
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:13,260
Is he F'ed activated?

2630
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:13,940
Yeah, no.

2631
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:21,820
Especially for me, because I've, uh, I tried, there's like one time I tried saying Sega Genesis, but instead I said Aega Genesis.

2632
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:27,600
And I was, like, working at a convention, so...

2633
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,420
Yeah, yeah, and you're just like all, you know, the kids too, and you're like, oh, fuck.

2634
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:33,860
Sega Genesis.

2635
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:38,360
I'm, like, supposed to be kind of a spokesperson for this stuff, but I'm...

2636
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:39,600
Hey, hey, you are!

2637
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:41,040
You are, though!

2638
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:44,360
You're very inclusive, you're...

2639
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,020
You know?

2640
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,040
What?

2641
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,640
You're very inclusive.

2642
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,320
Yeah, I'm including dyslexic people.

2643
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:55,180
Alright, let's see, oh, come on, Cloak!

2644
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,160
Come on!

2645
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:59,140
Oh, yeah, you're gonna run away, little boy?

2646
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:00,900
You're gonna run away?

2647
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,000
Oh, you know what, fuck you guys.

2648
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:05,560
I'm gonna kill you guys just for the sake of it.

2649
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:07,680
We won the fight, but I just...

2650
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,440
I'm giving them a message.

2651
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,040
Whoa, I've never seen those Groot skins before.

2652
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:12,540
Is this new?

2653
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:12,780
Which one?

2654
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,720
Like, blue crystals?

2655
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:17,860
Uh, no, it's an old skin, it's just there's, like, better skins.

2656
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:23,280
Not old, old, but, like, it's been a couple of weeks.

2657
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,780
It looks, like, blue raspberry flavored.

2658
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,040
Ooh, where are they?

2659
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:32,080
Are they going main?

2660
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,220
Oh, they are.

2661
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:36,900
Come on, let me farm you up here.

2662
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:40,540
That's right, give me free farms.

2663
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,340
That's right.

2664
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,980
Oh, they went Thor.

2665
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,620
Yeah, but they're just pushing, like...

2666
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,880
Yeah, like, they're...

2667
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,660
Yeah, I was like, yay, I'll charge!

2668
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:58,760
That's strange as all, but he's, like, not having a good time.

2669
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,020
Oh, wait, they went... they did a cloak up.

2670
01:49:03,220 --> 01:49:07,320
But he's, like, not going... he did a cloak up and then he ran off his ult.

2671
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:08,460
Yeah.

2672
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:11,460
I was like, what are you doing, buddy?

2673
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:12,900
Are you okay?

2674
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,660
He's not okay.

2675
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:17,880
Come on.

2676
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,980
Lower elo is so difficult sometimes because they move, like, so predictable.

2677
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,220
But I'm not used to predictable movement.

2678
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:26,860
Yeah.

2679
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,260
Used to playing against actual good players.

2680
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:33,800
Like, I'm used to players doing, like, really fucking weird strafe patterns.

2681
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:37,060
So when they move, like, in a way where I don't expect...

2682
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:38,780
I'm like, you're not... don't move like that!

2683
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,540
Don't move like that!

2684
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:41,980
And my muscle memory fucks up.

2685
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:45,580
Alright.

2686
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:48,780
Hello, guys.

2687
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:49,420
Hello.

2688
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,160
Hello, goodbye.

2689
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,480
You can't get healed in your ult, can you?

2690
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,400
Uh, no.

2691
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,920
I can't get damage in my ult.

2692
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:01,440
So it's fine.

2693
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:03,600
So, like, I don't worry.

2694
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,420
That exchange has ult.

2695
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,040
That exchange has ult.

2696
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:05,500
So careful.

2697
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,200
He's literally looking for it right now.

2698
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,140
Yeah, he is.

2699
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:08,700
Yeah.

2700
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:11,280
There he goes.

2701
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:12,280
Nice.

2702
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,200
He fucked it up.

2703
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:15,140
He fucked it up, too.

2704
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,120
Oh, nice.

2705
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:16,480
We win.

2706
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,820
Goodbye, judge!

2707
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,240
Let's go!

2708
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:25,220
Look at that.

2709
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,600
We're so warmed up now, Doobie.

2710
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:27,580
We're so warmed up.

2711
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:28,780
Let's go!

2712
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:35,540
The least obvious strange ult in the world.

2713
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:39,480
He's like, let me just walk forward.

2714
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:41,140
They'll never know.

2715
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,880
Yeah, it's kind of like Reinhardt, how you can tell when they have their ultimate.

2716
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:45,220
Yeah, yeah!

2717
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:49,340
They just try to walk forward and just be like...

2718
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,860
You're just like, I wonder what they're gonna do right now.

2719
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,760
I do hate going against a good strange, though, where they just obliterate you.

2720
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,080
Like, he does so much damage.

2721
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:04,160
Oh my god, when he flies up in the air and does this fucking Agumado.

2722
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,100
Yeah.

2723
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:07,140
And then you just don't expect it.

2724
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:10,660
Somebody in the chat noticed that the other team doesn't have any kills.

2725
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:12,180
Oh my... and we have zero deaths.

2726
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,320
We have zero deaths!

2727
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:20,360
At least we know they're actual good players.

2728
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,020
Thank god.

2729
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,420
Thank god I'm fighting real golds.

2730
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:25,680
Thank god.

2731
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,760
I need this ELO, guys.

2732
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,880
I need it so bad on my other alt account.

2733
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:36,780
When the season resets, what do you get from your main account?

2734
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,000
It was plat 1.

2735
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:40,140
Oh, okay.

2736
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,040
Yeah, it wasn't that bad.

2737
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:42,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2738
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:43,860
It was really easy to...

2739
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,580
Well, yeah, because all the other players are also plat 1, so it's not like, you know...

2740
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:52,020
It's not like too bad for ranked games.

2741
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:55,800
The games are actual high ELO games and stuff, so it was fun.

2742
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:57,880
Yeah, because a lot of people get put...

2743
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,880
I mean, yeah, especially at the start of the season, that's where they all get put.

2744
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2745
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,060
Alright, I'm gonna go flank.

2746
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:08,080
I'm gonna do something crazy with my rocket jump.

2747
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:09,800
That I learned.

2748
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:11,220
Rocket jump?

2749
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,300
Yeah, yeah, the rocket raccoon jump.

2750
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:16,280
Let me see if I can dash up without using it.

2751
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:16,920
Yeah, I can.

2752
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:20,040
Wait, they're just here.

2753
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,200
Goodbye.

2754
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,460
I'm literally in their... behind them.

2755
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:30,660
But they're like...

2756
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:30,920
Nice.

2757
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:34,120
They're like playing on like...

2758
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:35,660
Why are they playing like this?

2759
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:37,500
They're playing on point.

2760
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:39,100
It's so weird!

2761
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,980
It's so weird!

2762
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,640
It's so weird!

2763
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,140
Oh my god, they all want me dead.

2764
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,060
Why are you playing like this?

2765
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:54,140
I refuse to acknowledge this.

2766
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:56,620
Why are you guys being such freaks?

2767
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:57,540
I'm just gonna play frontline.

2768
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,580
They have too much like...

2769
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,500
They have way too much damage in the...

2770
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:02,660
Protection in the back.

2771
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,780
I guess they were ready for you, probably.

2772
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:07,340
I know.

2773
01:53:07,860 --> 01:53:08,700
Oh, shit.

2774
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:09,620
Okay.

2775
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,320
Alright.

2776
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:11,200
Nice.

2777
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:12,300
We need that.

2778
01:53:12,380 --> 01:53:12,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2779
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:13,520
We can't die now.

2780
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,440
Oh, I got fucking pulled into it!

2781
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:17,780
Oh, nice.

2782
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,080
Okay.

2783
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:20,580
Oh, nice.

2784
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:21,540
Nice, Brutal.

2785
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:23,620
Wait, we win.

2786
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:25,240
Yeah, I think so.

2787
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:27,060
Yeah, let me just ult this too.

2788
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:27,680
Don't!

2789
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,520
The group wall!

2790
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:32,580
I like...

2791
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:33,840
I ulted the wall.

2792
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:34,460
Oh.

2793
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,940
I jumped at the point.

2794
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,060
It was our own wall too!

2795
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:44,460
Oh my god.

2796
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:46,760
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you.

2797
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:47,980
Are you a bird?

2798
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:49,980
Yes, I'm...

2799
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:50,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2800
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,220
I'm a bird.

2801
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,100
So I'm like...

2802
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:53,660
What type of bird?

2803
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,840
Like a doki bird.

2804
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:02,000
I am one of my species.

2805
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:04,460
You're only one.

2806
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,100
Yeah, yeah.

2807
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,280
I'm literally like...

2808
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,080
Like endangered species, guys.

2809
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,240
So I'm accepting donations to...

2810
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,320
Save the species today.

2811
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,540
Save the doki bird.

2812
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:16,240
Save the...

2813
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,000
Wait, what kind of...

2814
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:17,960
What kind of germ?

2815
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:19,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2816
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,180
You're like a...

2817
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:22,080
Oh my god, what kind of...

2818
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,080
The specific rat.

2819
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:24,060
Like a...

2820
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,900
Wait, gerbil?

2821
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,220
Gerbil, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2822
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,600
No, it's not a gerbil.

2823
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:31,580
You said gerbil, so I was like...

2824
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:31,800
Oh yeah, gerbil.

2825
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,060
That's what I thought you were gonna say.

2826
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,580
No, no, you said gerbil.

2827
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:34,960
I was like...

2828
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,820
Yeah, gerbil.

2829
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:38,120
No, it's like...

2830
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,780
It's like those jumping rats.

2831
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:42,100
Yeah, yeah.

2832
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:43,160
Yeah, that's what...

2833
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:44,420
Short-eared gerboa.

2834
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,980
Yeah, yeah, gerboa.

2835
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:47,400
Little jumping rats.

2836
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:50,180
Oh, I'm liking a little bit, so my...

2837
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,040
I might look pixelated somewhat.

2838
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,800
I can't believe it, you baited me.

2839
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:57,200
You said...

2840
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,380
Yeah, it was a test.

2841
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,300
It was a test.

2842
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,180
Oh my god.

2843
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:04,440
Freaking failed.

2844
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:07,060
My chat was like, she's germa.

2845
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:09,960
You're a germa rat.

2846
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,480
The first three letters are correct.

2847
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:13,800
Yeah, it was like...

2848
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,320
It's a past, you know?

2849
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:18,820
It's technically a past if you think about it.

2850
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:22,660
It's not my fault my professor baited me.

2851
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,620
Gerbil is spelled with a G.

2852
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:26,620
That's true.

2853
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:29,400
Oh wait, is gerboa spelled with a J?

2854
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:30,760
Gerboa.

2855
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:33,560
What's the lifespan of a gerboa?

2856
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,820
It's like 10 years in captivity.

2857
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:41,140
Oh shit, are you in the wild or are you a captive gerboa?

2858
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,000
Despite all my rage, I'm just a rat in a cage.

2859
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,700
You're just a rat.

2860
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:48,700
What was it called?

2861
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,380
Wagee?

2862
01:55:50,120 --> 01:55:51,220
A wagee cage.

2863
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,260
Stuck in the cage-y.

2864
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:57,720
Wait, technically you are, because you're forced into the train cage.

2865
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:58,640
Yeah, yeah.

2866
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,800
Wagee cage-y, guys.

2867
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:05,540
Free her.

2868
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,820
Someone free her from the trains.

2869
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,120
It's kind of like a purgatory thing.

2870
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,360
Yeah, wait, that's worse.

2871
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,860
Give it to the group.

2872
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:22,000
Not the wagee cage.

2873
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,000
Wait, how do you get paid?

2874
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:28,340
What does the conductor pay you in?

2875
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:31,480
Coins.

2876
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:32,300
Coins?

2877
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:33,740
But like, you're in purgatory.

2878
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,180
How do you buy anything?

2879
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,980
I mean, there's some towns, you know.

2880
01:56:38,220 --> 01:56:39,020
There's some towns.

2881
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:40,760
Universal currency.

2882
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,020
Yeah.

2883
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:43,940
They should pay you in gold.

2884
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,380
Gold never lose value.

2885
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:52,620
Those people who just put their entire savings in gold and then bury it outside.

2886
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:56,660
I don't understand why gold is so valuable anyways.

2887
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,860
You can't use it for- it just looks nice.

2888
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:07,360
It's just like- it's like- because you're like, oh, gold is like the universal currency type deal where like, it's a fixed price type.

2889
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,860
But like, that's not true.

2890
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:14,600
Because gold can fall in value, but some people are like, oh no, it's gonna go back- it's like socks.

2891
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,780
You know, like, gold will come back.

2892
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:19,680
The value of gold- That's what I heard.

2893
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:24,180
It's probably different where you are, but the banks here are like, insured, I guess.

2894
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:27,860
The FDIC government insured up to a certain amount.

2895
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:32,780
I guess people are talking about that they're gonna take it away soon, so everybody's talking about buying gold.

2896
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,840
Just to make sure.

2897
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,680
That's like actual conspiracy theories.

2898
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:44,560
I just realized we only have Root as our king, and our Groot was like, not feeling okay.

2899
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,560
Our Groot.

2900
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,100
I got you.

2901
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,000
I'll go first.

2902
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:52,520
Woo, I'm dancing.

2903
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,120
Come on.

2904
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:02,140
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2905
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,800
Calm down, sir.

2906
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:06,740
That's- Oh, whoa.

2907
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:07,780
It's okay.

2908
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,580
I got frozen.

2909
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,880
Oh my god, I got solo ulted!

2910
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:15,580
He's so- that freak.

2911
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,340
He actually solo ulted me.

2912
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:24,520
I feel like maybe it'd be good to- What is it, like copper wires, people?

2913
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,640
Copper wire?

2914
01:58:26,060 --> 01:58:31,100
Yeah, because they'll be used for electronics and stuff, so maybe it'd be good to stock up on that.

2915
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:33,940
Make their own 50-80.

2916
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:44,280
If the social economy or whatever collapses, then you can make your own graphics card if you have the right tools.

2917
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:49,360
Our Wolverine just- Our Wolverine killed himself, but then the Iron Man just flew away.

2918
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:57,260
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

2919
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:01,620
Oh my god, it's fine, we're okay.

2920
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,820
Oh my god, I'm gonna play in your ult.

2921
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:04,700
That's right.

2922
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:12,960
I'm gonna kill this Iron Man, because he's too- This Iron Man is too stupid to go in her luna ult.

2923
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,760
Oh, wait, that's our only tank though.

2924
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,140
Oh, wait, he did!

2925
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,420
Oh, no, no, no!

2926
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,240
I'm watching Gru walk backwards!

2927
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:26,880
No!

2928
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:28,860
No!

2929
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,820
Then he'll be back.

2930
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:34,680
Then he'll be back, right?

2931
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,920
Then he'll be back.

2932
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:39,560
He's not lonewolf69.

2933
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:43,060
Lonewolf69, come back!

2934
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:44,500
No!

2935
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,040
Oh, he's back, he's back.

2936
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:52,040
Oh, he is lagging, he is lagging, lagging.

2937
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:56,460
I'm teleporting right now through the walls.

2938
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,680
Can you heal me real quick?

2939
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,560
Where is he?

2940
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:01,120
I'm here, I'm right beside you.

2941
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:05,960
He's walking over as best as he could.

2942
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,760
He's very slowly walking over.

2943
02:00:10,700 --> 02:00:12,340
He's trying his best.

2944
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,760
Our Moon Knight is our tank right now.

2945
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:20,160
Nice, good job.

2946
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:27,960
And the worst part is just the fact that I had to look at our Gru just standing still.

2947
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:33,240
Standing still while we all got Strange ulted, that was so sad.

2948
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,760
That was actually so sad!

2949
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,060
We probably could have held the point if he did it this way.

2950
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:40,480
100%, I agree.

2951
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:43,260
Alright, I'm grabbing the Strange.

2952
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,260
C'mon, c'mon Strange, go die!

2953
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,480
Wait, are you like scared over these guys?

2954
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:51,380
Oh, maybe I'm scared too.

2955
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,340
She's getting healed and I'm not.

2956
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:57,340
She has like a Rocket Heal with her.

2957
02:00:58,340 --> 02:00:59,540
Is Rocket Heal really that good?

2958
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,820
I always thought he was kind of like a...

2959
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:06,960
It's alright, but I was 1v2ing a Rocket and Luna and I was like, oh yeah, you win this.

2960
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:12,120
My shift doesn't outheal that.

2961
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:16,080
Oh my god, we definitely could have full health.

2962
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:19,230
That is the furthest...

2963
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:20,840
That kills him!

2964
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:24,020
No, you died!

2965
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,340
I was like, that is so far, that's no way.

2966
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:30,020
There's no way!

2967
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,480
I thought I'd live this!

2968
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:35,300
I thought I'd live!

2969
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:43,580
It's okay, I just wanted to give him like a satisfaction.

2970
02:01:44,260 --> 02:01:49,180
You know, I died on purpose to make him feel good about himself.

2971
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:52,260
Yeah, then he'll psych himself out.

2972
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:55,180
He's gonna be overconfident.

2973
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:56,340
Yeah, exactly.

2974
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,760
He's gonna be playing so overconfident because he thinks he's him, you know?

2975
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:03,520
He's like, I'm him right now.

2976
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:04,740
I'm that guy.

2977
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,620
I'm that guy.

2978
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,700
Oh, we actually have a second tank?

2979
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,420
Oh my god, in gold?

2980
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:14,620
Finally.

2981
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,940
Oh my god, who are you?

2982
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:20,880
Oh my god, you don't deserve to be in this healer if you're willing to swap.

2983
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,540
What were they playing?

2984
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,420
I don't need a DPS that was not doing anything, I think.

2985
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,260
Was that our Wolverine, I think?

2986
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:30,500
Yeah, it was our Wolverine.

2987
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:31,380
He has four kills.

2988
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:36,040
He has four kills, it's 100% our Wolverine.

2989
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,280
Do people play Wolverine at like a higher rank?

2990
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:41,900
Oh my god, they do.

2991
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:42,560
It's so scary.

2992
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,120
If you're playing Wolverine at a low ELO, then you're a bad Wolverine.

2993
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:50,800
A good Wolverine is very, very scary.

2994
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,920
He can basically 1v6 everybody.

2995
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:59,960
How is he so tanky?

2996
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:01,500
His passive.

2997
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,440
He can't die right away.

2998
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,320
But his passive, he basically can grab some...

2999
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:13,720
Also, if you're playing with a good team, a magneetle will shield him when he goes in.

3000
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And then you put a snowflake on him and he just never dies.

3001
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:19,460
And then he just grabs a tank.

3002
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:20,760
He kidnaps tanks and stuff.

3003
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:21,720
Does he have lifesteal?

3004
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:23,220
Because I always see him gain shield.

3005
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,440
No, that's his passive.

3006
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:28,720
So if he's about to die, he gains shield type deal.

3007
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,120
And he has damage reduction.

3008
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:34,120
Kind of like Venom's shield.

3009
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,140
But Venom's shield, you pop it yourself.

3010
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:41,360
For Wolverine, it happens automatically.

3011
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:46,500
That's why in higher ELO, everybody just bans Wolverine.

3012
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,000
Because nobody wants to play against a Wolverine.

3013
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,900
Is it just this, Ethan?

3014
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,880
Because he got a buff?

3015
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:55,800
Yeah, he got a buff when he's already so strong.

3016
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:00,900
The only tank you can play against a good Wolverine is Magneetle.

3017
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:04,080
Because he can shield everybody.

3018
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:08,580
A good Wolverine is actual game changer.

3019
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:13,240
Every single Wolverine I've seen in this ELO.

3020
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:17,020
I like that one where they go off the side of the map.

3021
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:20,140
Oh yeah, the Wolverine memes.

3022
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:21,360
Have you seen the Wolverine memes?

3023
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,800
I don't think so.

3024
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,180
Wait, you haven't seen the animal?

3025
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,820
Oh my god, you haven't seen the animal?

3026
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,240
Okay, I'll send you the video.

3027
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:31,020
It's so good.

3028
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:34,520
It's my favorite.

3029
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:37,260
I always think about that.

3030
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:41,220
That and the Roblox meme is like the two memes that's been living breath-free in my head.

3031
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,220
Okay, goodbye Hulk.

3032
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:48,980
He tried.

3033
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:50,540
What are you doing?

3034
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:53,160
He like jumped in and that froze him.

3035
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:56,420
He popped me off real fast.

3036
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:57,480
Thank you.

3037
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:00,680
He just jumped in and was like, this is it.

3038
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,520
This is my time.

3039
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,580
He is definitely not a Hulk player, that's for sure.

3040
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,200
I'm just trying him out.

3041
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:13,140
Oh, they're healing each other.

3042
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,100
Alright, that's fine.

3043
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:15,160
The two supports ran away.

3044
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,320
Oh, they're running triple support.

3045
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:20,760
Their Hulk is lagging.

3046
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:26,380
What is he doing?

3047
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:28,320
His best.

3048
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:29,880
Where did the Iron Man go?

3049
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,440
The Iron Man disappeared.

3050
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:35,640
Oh, pretty fast.

3051
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:36,880
What?

3052
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:39,760
He just killed his Hulk charger.

3053
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:42,580
This guy does not play Hulk.

3054
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,340
Oh my god.

3055
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:44,160
Iron Man's above.

3056
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:44,760
Oh, he is?

3057
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:45,220
Where is he?

3058
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,580
He's like behind.

3059
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:47,220
I'll kill him.

3060
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:48,640
I kill him or I die.

3061
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:49,760
He's just standing really far away.

3062
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:54,020
Okay, maybe I do die?

3063
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:54,760
No, I kill him.

3064
02:05:57,940 --> 02:05:58,560
Let's go.

3065
02:05:58,820 --> 02:05:59,440
I got you.

3066
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:01,540
Okay, it's fine.

3067
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:02,600
Goodbye.

3068
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:04,060
Goodbye, Hulk charge.

3069
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:05,440
Alright.

3070
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,400
He has ult, right?

3071
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:08,200
I'm pushing the point.

3072
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:11,780
We're already going to cap it right now.

3073
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:18,380
Our penny was just on the point.

3074
02:06:20,180 --> 02:06:21,940
Maybe the Hulk wanted to be on stream.

3075
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:26,220
What is he doing?

3076
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:33,280
No, I'm pretty sure because they have an Iron Man player and report the RTT.

3077
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:36,700
Which one?

3078
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:39,660
Yeah, which one?

3079
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:41,460
Oh my god.

3080
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:45,860
Oh my god.

3081
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,780
I'm going to say, which one?

3082
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:57,680
They were all pretty bad.

3083
02:06:57,920 --> 02:06:58,700
I'm not going to lie.

3084
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:02,660
I had no idea who we were talking about there.

3085
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:05,480
I can't get it.

3086
02:07:05,500 --> 02:07:06,320
I didn't say it.

3087
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:06,780
It was them.

3088
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:07,420
They said it.

3089
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:13,920
Alright, let's go.

3090
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:17,740
Oh, they have a plat on the other team.

3091
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:21,500
No, we have Delft Destroyer.

3092
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,180
It's okay.

3093
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:26,740
We got him.

3094
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:29,260
He's going to clutch it for us.

3095
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:33,720
I believe in him.

3096
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:37,600
Alright, MrDuckTurtle, the bucky player.

3097
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:41,820
Alright.

3098
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:44,820
Sidelock time.

3099
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:48,300
GoldenBelow is toxic and terrible.

3100
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:52,440
Oh no, people in my chat, you think GoldenBelow is toxic and terrible?

3101
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:54,660
Hielo is just as bad.

3102
02:07:57,620 --> 02:08:00,740
I feel like it's higher stakes and people get even more angry maybe.

3103
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:06,500
It's because people in Hielo have bigger egos too because they think they're the very best type deal.

3104
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:15,280
But then the funny thing is that if they lose a game that they think they're going to win, their mental is destroyed for the rest of the day.

3105
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:25,840
If you win against them one time, you fuck their mentals because you think they're the very best and then they're like, wait, am I not the very best?

3106
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:31,760
That's the best part.

3107
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:36,160
They actually break, yeah.

3108
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:40,480
They start breaking and start picking troll characters because they think it's over.

3109
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:44,300
There's a secret hole.

3110
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,200
Oh, there it is.

3111
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,260
There's a secret hole.

3112
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:47,460
Secret tunnel.

3113
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,080
Are they TPing?

3114
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:56,960
Okay, I used my invis too early there.

3115
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,100
Oh my god!

3116
02:08:59,220 --> 02:08:59,800
Wait, what?

3117
02:08:59,980 --> 02:09:00,860
Everybody's dead.

3118
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:04,060
Okay.

3119
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:08,560
Oh,

3120
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:17,600
we might have lost the point, but I fucked over the Punisher.

3121
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:19,040
I made a statement.

3122
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:22,640
Alright, we'll go up.

3123
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,900
That Punisher did not turn around.

3124
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:26,700
It was funny.

3125
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:29,040
How does the enemy team already have so many kills?

3126
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,620
I don't know.

3127
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:35,220
I left you guys for a second and then a lot of stuff happened.

3128
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:35,960
It was crazy.

3129
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:38,100
I'm just gonna farm this guy.

3130
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:43,820
Bro, he's just getting- Oh, wait.

3131
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:46,060
Nevermind, he's not getting healed anymore.

3132
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,380
Bro, he was an ult battery for me.

3133
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,280
It was crazy.

3134
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,300
Like, I'm not complaining.

3135
02:09:55,780 --> 02:09:57,460
I am a little low though.

3136
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,680
Alright, I'm gonna grab this real fast for us.

3137
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:07,040
Oh, that's bad.

3138
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:09,820
I can't do anything aside from here.

3139
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:13,240
There's always too much healing going on.

3140
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:14,420
Oh, wait.

3141
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:16,180
Oh, wait.

3142
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:16,840
Nevermind.

3143
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,720
He's fucked up his grapple, I guess.

3144
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,560
Oh, we're portaling.

3145
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:23,600
Oh, we are?

3146
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:24,480
Yeah.

3147
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:25,560
There.

3148
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:29,000
Oh, that's- Whoa.

3149
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:30,720
Are you guys okay?

3150
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:32,720
Yeah.

3151
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,320
Alright, nice.

3152
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:38,020
I'm getting a little bliss, I guess.

3153
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,080
Oh my god, where am I?

3154
02:10:42,190 --> 02:10:43,220
Oh, where am I?

3155
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,660
Where am I?

3156
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,040
I'm healing.

3157
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:47,440
I'm being kicked up everywhere.

3158
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:50,020
Alright, I'd swap.

3159
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:53,700
I can play Trihella.

3160
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:55,640
Maybe.

3161
02:10:55,860 --> 02:10:58,420
What was the portal like?

3162
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:03,060
It was like- It was something.

3163
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:07,020
Trihella, if it doesn't work.

3164
02:11:07,660 --> 02:11:09,280
I wish I could play Wolverine.

3165
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,680
I could fuck up this route if I could.

3166
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,100
Oh my god, I die- I get melted so fast.

3167
02:11:20,020 --> 02:11:20,220
No!

3168
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:24,560
Alright.

3169
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:32,300
I guess the easiest would be Punisher and just use the Groot as an ult charge battery.

3170
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,740
Wait, we have a Groot?

3171
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:35,460
Oh, they have a Groot.

3172
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:36,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3173
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,940
So I was like, but Punisher is- like, Wolverine is easy- No, it's not.

3174
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:41,020
It's not.

3175
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,780
He's actually pretty difficult to learn.

3176
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,720
Or do Bucky.

3177
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:46,180
Bucky might be good.

3178
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:51,080
Do you think we could play TripleSport and then go rocket him?

3179
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:52,700
Ooh, yeah, we could.

3180
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:54,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3181
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:56,220
I'm trying because it wasn't working last round.

3182
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,940
Yeah, let's try this.

3183
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:01,160
Should I switch to dive?

3184
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:06,780
At the moment, we just need more damage on the Groot and it should be fine.

3185
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:10,740
Yeah, if you were like- Guys, you guys don't understand.

3186
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,380
It's so hard to grab people as Wolverine.

3187
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,920
I always grab nothing.

3188
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:19,160
It does seem- I don't know.

3189
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:21,080
Like a high-skill feeling, right?

3190
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:22,500
Yeah, yeah, super high-skill.

3191
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:24,620
There's just so many buttons and everything.

3192
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:26,080
Oh, doesn't he have combos?

3193
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:27,640
Yeah, yeah, he does.

3194
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,340
It's so hard.

3195
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,380
Mostly, I just- I would ult nothing too.

3196
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:33,360
I always get confused on how to ult with him.

3197
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:35,400
Because I just be like, how?

3198
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:36,200
How the fuck?

3199
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:41,080
Did you watch the new Deadpool movie with Wolverine?

3200
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:41,760
Oh, yeah.

3201
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:44,480
I liked it.

3202
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:46,760
It was like a- Like a yaoi.

3203
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:49,280
Yeah, the car scene.

3204
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:53,300
Oh, shit.

3205
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:54,340
Oh, a team gave me ammo?

3206
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:55,660
Oh, never mind.

3207
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:57,140
Oh, shit.

3208
02:12:57,320 --> 02:12:57,860
It's so fast.

3209
02:12:57,980 --> 02:12:59,120
I don't know if they can focus me down.

3210
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,080
Yeah, I was gonna be like, wait a minute, where did you go?

3211
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:06,280
Oh, what the fuck?

3212
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,900
I thought he was gonna die for that.

3213
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:10,600
Oh my god.

3214
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:13,980
Okay.

3215
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,200
Yay, I'm back!

3216
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:15,540
Hello!

3217
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:16,700
Hello, hello!

3218
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:18,040
Okay, whatever you want.

3219
02:13:18,180 --> 02:13:18,320
Okay.

3220
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:26,220
Oh my god, okay.

3221
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:30,460
Oh my- No, what the fuck?

3222
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,020
I can't even like, peek.

3223
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,400
That's crazy.

3224
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:35,980
It won't even let me peek.

3225
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:36,760
Oh, that's it.

3226
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:40,400
I'm gonna ult- I'm gonna do it again and then I'm gonna play Punisher because I know I'm gonna die.

3227
02:13:43,460 --> 02:13:43,860
Alright.

3228
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:47,660
I literally just sat there for like one second and died.

3229
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:48,380
That's crazy.

3230
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:52,880
Oh my god.

3231
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:53,860
Hey, we gotta kill Elise.

3232
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:57,180
I'm gonna be- Am I dead to this?

3233
02:13:57,220 --> 02:13:57,540
Okay.

3234
02:13:57,820 --> 02:13:58,980
No, but I'll be dead to this.

3235
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:02,500
Oh, okay, he clicked it.

3236
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:02,960
That's fine.

3237
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:07,880
It's fine.

3238
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,160
I wanted to swap to Punisher.

3239
02:14:09,620 --> 02:14:14,960
I feel like I just needed to like- I was like, who do I kill?

3240
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:20,760
Maybe I should shoot at the one character that can, you know, dodge it.

3241
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:23,880
That's so smart.

3242
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:28,680
And this is like my third time playing Bucky, I have a confession.

3243
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:32,360
That's okay, it's good practice.

3244
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:34,520
Oh no, no, no, I'm dead.

3245
02:14:34,860 --> 02:14:35,000
It's practice, exactly.

3246
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:37,540
It's good practice, exactly.

3247
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:43,960
I literally come back just to die because everybody's- Yeah, you got ulted.

3248
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:46,960
I come back and I have to die.

3249
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:48,220
I'm so sad.

3250
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:51,360
I'm so sad.

3251
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:54,440
No, our moves ready.

3252
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:56,800
Reset, everybody, reset.

3253
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,320
Just reset, guys.

3254
02:15:03,860 --> 02:15:05,520
I'm just going to put your ammo down.

3255
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:05,760
Okay.

3256
02:15:05,980 --> 02:15:06,340
Whatever.

3257
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:09,420
I haven't been able to use it at all.

3258
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:17,780
Oh my god, he's just ult charging for me, but like, he doesn't care.

3259
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:19,780
That's the messed up part, he doesn't care.

3260
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:27,120
Jesus Christ, like, what do I do?

3261
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:28,900
I can't, I can't live.

3262
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,900
I can't live.

3263
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:32,880
Oh my gosh.

3264
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:36,280
Also, I need to make sure to take off my tog.

3265
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:38,140
Every time I play Punisher, I keep forgetting.

3266
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:40,180
Alright.

3267
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:42,460
It's okay, it's not us.

3268
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:43,540
It's never us.

3269
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:46,820
No, we've been winning, so it's not us.

3270
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,880
It's not us, it's never us.

3271
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:53,960
Good night.

3272
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:58,520
Look, it's always... It's everybody but us.

3273
02:15:59,280 --> 02:15:59,700
Yeah.

3274
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,720
I mean, it's definitely not you.

3275
02:16:04,460 --> 02:16:06,940
Since you're carrying me, it's definitely not me.

3276
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:09,940
Yeah, yeah, and it's not you, so it's everybody else.

3277
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:16,040
Like, you know, it's so difficult to, like, deal with four other crutches, you know?

3278
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:18,460
Four other players with no hands, you know?

3279
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:21,000
And they had a plat player!

3280
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:22,340
Like, what are we supposed to do?

3281
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:23,520
They had a plat.

3282
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:23,820
Yeah.

3283
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:26,820
Oh, this one also... Oh, wait, we have a plat too, so it's fine.

3284
02:16:26,820 --> 02:16:27,860
Yeah, now it's fine.

3285
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:31,660
Now that we have a plat player, things would be easier now.

3286
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:40,120
Do you listen to the in-game music, or do you have, like, a proper in-game music?

3287
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:40,500
Yeah, I do.

3288
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:44,920
Because, like, I don't mind... I don't like playing with, like, random music while I'm playing.

3289
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,460
Because I like to focus up and stuff, so...

3290
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:49,160
It can be distracting.

3291
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:53,100
Yeah, and I listen to this music so much that it's just, like, easy to tune out now.

3292
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,940
Alright, back to Psylocke.

3293
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,300
Psylocke's so fun to play.

3294
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:00,840
Have you ever played Psylocke?

3295
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:02,800
No, I've never played her.

3296
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:03,960
It's like Genji, right?

3297
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:05,860
Yeah, it's like Genji, but, like, easy Genji.

3298
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:08,280
Because her shots are, like, hitscan.

3299
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:11,740
Oh, and also the ult is, like, automatic, right?

3300
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:15,200
Yeah, yeah, like, you don't have to worry, just...

3301
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:17,740
But there is RNG to her ult, though.

3302
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:22,900
Because, like, you don't know where it's going to focus and type E.

3303
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:25,280
Oh, shit, I never tried the portal?

3304
02:17:26,300 --> 02:17:28,540
Oh my god, that's cool.

3305
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:31,280
I don't know the matchup.

3306
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:35,780
Wait, what does she team up with?

3307
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:38,540
She teams up with Black Panther and Magic.

3308
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:40,900
So, like, I can use her Magic portals.

3309
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:42,780
Oh, that's cool.

3310
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:43,260
I didn't know that.

3311
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:44,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3312
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:47,960
Alright.

3313
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,680
We got this, I believe.

3314
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:55,360
We're climbing.

3315
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:57,140
We're technically positive right now.

3316
02:17:58,600 --> 02:17:59,060
Right?

3317
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:00,980
For what?

3318
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:01,940
Are we up, right?

3319
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:04,200
Uh, yeah.

3320
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:05,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3321
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:08,380
Wait, what was your number for the gold one?

3322
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:09,840
What number were you at?

3323
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:12,760
Um, what do you mean?

3324
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:13,500
Like, the points?

3325
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:14,380
Oh, yeah, yeah, the points.

3326
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:14,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3327
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:19,600
I think we were at, like, 80 and then we lost points right now, so I think it's like 60.

3328
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:21,420
Okay, so, we're close.

3329
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:22,480
Yeah.

3330
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:31,940
Oh my god, they're so low.

3331
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:34,580
I'm lagging.

3332
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,440
No, no!

3333
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:36,800
It's okay, you're alive!

3334
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:37,320
You're alive!

3335
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:39,000
If you're lagging, you're alive!

3336
02:18:39,820 --> 02:18:40,200
You're alive!

3337
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:41,940
You're so healthy!

3338
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:45,160
I'm literally seeing you're very much alive!

3339
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:47,000
I'm getting, I'm getting the lags, guys.

3340
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:48,560
You're so healthy right now.

3341
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:50,820
I'm not looking, but I'm pretty sure you are.

3342
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:54,860
You're like a doctor, like, oh, the baby's so healthy!

3343
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:57,320
Yeah, yeah, the baby is so healthy right now!

3344
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:59,580
Oh my god, wait, they're doing triple support.

3345
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:02,300
What the fuck?

3346
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,040
Do not panic, you're so healthy!

3347
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:14,600
Wait, what if I just...

3348
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:18,540
What the fuck is going on in this fight?

3349
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:20,400
What is this RNG?

3350
02:19:20,660 --> 02:19:20,940
No!

3351
02:19:21,640 --> 02:19:22,820
I got bad RNG.

3352
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:26,620
What the fuck?

3353
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:27,380
Stranger, are you okay?

3354
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,140
Yeah, he's up here all by himself.

3355
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,440
Stranger, are you okay?

3356
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:34,840
Oh shit, I've got to run.

3357
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:35,280
I've got to run.

3358
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:35,880
I've got to run.

3359
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:38,020
I don't want to be part of this.

3360
02:19:38,020 --> 02:19:39,760
I don't think he got anybody in there, did he?

3361
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:42,120
Oh, his teammate.

3362
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:43,500
Wait, wait, what?

3363
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:47,460
He, like, taxied his teammate.

3364
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:48,320
What?

3365
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:50,020
What the fuck?

3366
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:50,940
That's actually kind of smart.

3367
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,980
Like, what if it's overtime instead of a strange portal?

3368
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:56,540
It's like just ult and brings them to point.

3369
02:19:58,160 --> 02:19:59,900
Yeah, I could see that.

3370
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,020
I've never seen that play though.

3371
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:05,760
It was definitely very unique.

3372
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,480
It worked, I think.

3373
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:11,060
Yeah, it did.

3374
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:13,500
It did work.

3375
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:15,500
Because we weren't expecting it.

3376
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:16,260
Yeah.

3377
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:20,360
Alright, I'm going to wait until... Oh, we're still fighting?

3378
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:20,700
Okay.

3379
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:24,780
Bye bye!

3380
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:27,520
Aww, whore.

3381
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,800
He ulted my attack.

3382
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:34,480
Oh, nice.

3383
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:37,920
I do the same thing in games, but I say, like, uh...

3384
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:40,340
I don't know, maybe I even say it on stream, you'll get demonetized.

3385
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:43,540
Don't worry, I just said it.

3386
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:45,180
It's a popular Australian word.

3387
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:51,680
Just be an Australian and you get the pass.

3388
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,080
Yeah.

3389
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:57,440
No, it's not that bad.

3390
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:58,580
It's alright.

3391
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:00,820
She's like 1% Australian.

3392
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:02,080
Maybe.

3393
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:02,600
Yeah.

3394
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,460
I just did that.

3395
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:06,300
What was it called?

3396
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:07,080
23andMe?

3397
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:08,580
I don't even know if you did it.

3398
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:09,780
Oh, yeah.

3399
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:10,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3400
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:12,860
Just to see if you're Australian.

3401
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,440
No, I'm not.

3402
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,460
I'm like 4% Chinese.

3403
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,320
Oh, that's interesting.

3404
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:21,100
What?

3405
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:22,900
I didn't know that.

3406
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:26,020
I was like, where did that come from?

3407
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:27,540
I don't know.

3408
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:30,760
Alright, nice.

3409
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:31,500
We did it.

3410
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:34,160
Jin, this is insane.

3411
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:37,060
This is like... I don't wonder why they have three supports.

3412
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:39,280
The fucking backline does not exist.

3413
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:40,480
Yeah.

3414
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:44,020
They're having a rough time.

3415
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:46,220
I believe.

3416
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:52,500
I gotta be like, they're basically sisters!

3417
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,360
Yeah!

3418
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:00,080
Oh my god!

3419
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:02,560
Creep, creep, creep.

3420
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:06,000
The only time I've ever used that before is like, I met up with someone.

3421
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:06,480
Yeah.

3422
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:07,460
It was like a...

3423
02:22:07,460 --> 02:22:07,760
Not in CS?

3424
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:08,740
I was looking for a job.

3425
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:10,640
No.

3426
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:19,100
I was looking for a job, and I was like, I went to an interview type of thing, and it was kind of like a weird VR chat job where...

3427
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:19,320
Yeah.

3428
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:24,780
It was like before VTubers were popular, so they were trying to do like a VTuber thing, but in VR chat.

3429
02:22:24,780 --> 02:22:30,200
But they were trying to like, it's like a companion, like kind of like an adult thing, and I was like, oh, I don't want to do that part.

3430
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:30,880
Oh, that's weird.

3431
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:35,320
I don't want to do that part, but I can help you with like the 3D stuff, kind of.

3432
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:36,340
Yeah, yeah, you can assist.

3433
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:38,260
And they were like, are you Korean?

3434
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:39,700
And I'm like, what the hell?

3435
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:41,420
I'm not Korean.

3436
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:43,360
Do I look Korean?

3437
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:44,420
Maybe, I don't know.

3438
02:22:45,020 --> 02:22:47,180
About 4% Chinese, maybe that's it.

3439
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:49,500
Maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3440
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:51,000
Oh, yeah, we won.

3441
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:52,800
Nice.

3442
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:54,840
They just took it.

3443
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:56,660
Just let us take it.

3444
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:57,940
Wait, what's this group doing?

3445
02:22:58,540 --> 02:22:59,700
What are you doing?

3446
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,980
You literally just walked up to me.

3447
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:07,100
I'm like, yeah, don't mind if I take that extra ult charge.

3448
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:11,460
Did they take that?

3449
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:12,800
They're like, oh my god, you're hired.

3450
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:13,640
Nah.

3451
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:21,940
No, when I realized what it was, because I wasn't really sure what exactly it was before I went.

3452
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:24,360
And so when I learned what it was, I was like, oh.

3453
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:27,520
Okay, you're just like, no, never mind, I know how to do it.

3454
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:30,020
I'm like, okay, yeah, we'll be in contact, sure.

3455
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:37,760
Did they actually do anything about it in the end, or did the project just die?

3456
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,260
No, I think the project just died.

3457
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:44,320
And also, I looked it up afterwards, and it's against VRChat's terms of services to do something like that.

3458
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:46,980
Oh, so it wasn't even affiliated with VRChat, it was just like a separate thing.

3459
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:47,700
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

3460
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:51,180
It was just somebody like, oh, I'm going to use VRChat to sell...

3461
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:52,040
Yeah, yes.

3462
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:53,760
You can't do that.

3463
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:56,800
You can do it secretly.

3464
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:03,400
And I think the concept too, they only wanted one character, but then they wanted multiple people to play the same character, if that makes sense.

3465
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:04,580
Yeah.

3466
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:06,620
I don't think people would like that anyway.

3467
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:13,440
Yeah, that's like, people don't like that, because they'll be like, wait, but you said you liked this, and now you don't?

3468
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:14,160
Catfish.

3469
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,740
Yeah, I'm going to kill you, Mantis Story.

3470
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:21,600
Alright, that's fine, that's a good exchange.

3471
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:26,300
I used my ult just to kill that Mantis ult, so she used it for no reason.

3472
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:29,700
Which is good enough for me.

3473
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:35,100
Oh my god, I'm heading back, don't worry team!

3474
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:36,900
The Psylocke is coming!

3475
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:40,260
No, we lost our magic!

3476
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:40,860
We lost the rocket.

3477
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:41,860
No!

3478
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:44,060
Oh, and we lost...

3479
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:45,360
Yeah, we're down three.

3480
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:51,000
I didn't realize that we didn't even have our special TP now.

3481
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:53,720
Really?

3482
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:56,880
Really, you died to...

3483
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:57,420
Kill her!

3484
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,080
Who's healing her?

3485
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:01,680
Who's healing the Cloak?

3486
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:12,920
I was shooting the Cloak for like 20 years, and I was like, who the fuck is healing her right now?

3487
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:17,740
Oh my god, chill, chill, chill, chill.

3488
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:23,360
That is ours, that's good, I'll play in it then.

3489
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:27,720
Oh my god, that is... I'm just gonna farm ult.

3490
02:25:31,060 --> 02:25:35,560
Oh my god, I'm looking at the floor to make sure I don't die.

3491
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:38,700
Oh no!

3492
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,600
I got pulled.

3493
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:46,580
Alright, I forced Mantis ult again.

3494
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:50,280
Oh my god, I didn't have dash.

3495
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,460
I forced the support ult.

3496
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:53,740
It's fine.

3497
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:56,680
We're still fighting?

3498
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,600
Oh shit, okay.

3499
02:25:58,940 --> 02:25:59,720
Hey, we got to 99.

3500
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:00,680
We got it, yeah.

3501
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:05,800
Alright, it's fine, we got to 99.

3502
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:07,380
That's all that matters.

3503
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:11,100
I was like, what the fuck, why is...

3504
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:13,700
Why is nobody... Oh no.

3505
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:14,900
He's so low.

3506
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:18,080
No, stupid triple support.

3507
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:22,600
Stupid triple support.

3508
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:26,500
Oh nice.

3509
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:30,620
Aren't you like a pro, Mantis?

3510
02:26:30,860 --> 02:26:32,360
I killed her.

3511
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:36,380
No, the storm!

3512
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,400
I didn't expect to see the storm.

3513
02:26:40,460 --> 02:26:42,160
Somebody gets res'ed, I think.

3514
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:45,000
No, I think Rocket res'ed somebody else, I'm pretty sure.

3515
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:48,260
No, I don't think I should be the one swapping.

3516
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:51,900
I think there is someone that's clearly underperforming.

3517
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:58,220
Someone is clearly underperforming on our team.

3518
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:00,540
It's not me.

3519
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:02,180
No, it's not.

3520
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:03,100
It is...

3521
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:06,860
It's someone that's been... Oh nice, nice.

3522
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:07,610
Oh, nevermind.

3523
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:08,710
My field.

3524
02:27:10,910 --> 02:27:12,450
I see what you're saying.

3525
02:27:14,950 --> 02:27:18,710
He is not doing so well right now.

3526
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:20,630
Hello, Sleugy.

3527
02:27:21,010 --> 02:27:21,630
He should play Magic.

3528
02:27:21,630 --> 02:27:24,030
Maybe they play support also.

3529
02:27:24,710 --> 02:27:25,110
Maybe.

3530
02:27:25,490 --> 02:27:28,210
Can you continue to play Magic?

3531
02:27:29,650 --> 02:27:31,530
I want the team up.

3532
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,730
The team up is really good.

3533
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:38,110
You only get it if it's all three?

3534
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:38,770
Yeah.

3535
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:41,840
Or... Oh, nevermind.

3536
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:44,330
Thor is good too.

3537
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:47,810
I mean, I can play Storm.

3538
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:49,090
Fuck it, I'll play Storm.

3539
02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:50,610
I'm not good.

3540
02:27:51,610 --> 02:27:52,910
Storm has a team up, yeah.

3541
02:27:53,450 --> 02:27:54,230
That makes sense.

3542
02:27:55,310 --> 02:27:55,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3543
02:27:56,050 --> 02:27:57,790
I think I'm better than the enemy Storm.

3544
02:27:59,970 --> 02:28:02,890
Psylocke is really bad with triple support, I feel like.

3545
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:04,330
I don't know.

3546
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:05,790
I just feel like nothing dies.

3547
02:28:07,190 --> 02:28:10,430
It's so difficult when nothing dies.

3548
02:28:11,570 --> 02:28:12,110
Yeah.

3549
02:28:14,250 --> 02:28:16,510
I've been against a few like...

3550
02:28:16,510 --> 02:28:17,330
That's why I don't...

3551
02:28:18,070 --> 02:28:20,990
That's why I don't like playing as triple support.

3552
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:24,870
Just because nothing dies and it just feels so boring.

3553
02:28:26,110 --> 02:28:29,770
You're just rotating ults over and over again until something happens.

3554
02:28:30,070 --> 02:28:30,850
Oh, okay.

3555
02:28:31,050 --> 02:28:31,550
Alright, okay.

3556
02:28:34,330 --> 02:28:36,490
Do you think they'll change it and like next season or something?

3557
02:28:36,610 --> 02:28:37,170
I don't know.

3558
02:28:37,410 --> 02:28:39,750
I feel like... I mean, I hope they do.

3559
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:44,810
But I feel like... Oh, another thing I don't know about playing Storm is just healing-wise.

3560
02:28:45,670 --> 02:28:46,930
It's like super risky.

3561
02:28:49,490 --> 02:28:51,490
It's easier for Cloak and Dagger to heal Storm.

3562
02:28:51,850 --> 02:28:52,190
Yeah.

3563
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:53,550
Oh, I got my ult though.

3564
02:28:53,790 --> 02:28:54,370
Yeah, yeah.

3565
02:28:54,610 --> 02:28:57,010
We have like Rocket and they have triple support.

3566
02:28:57,210 --> 02:28:59,470
So it's easier for their Storm to live.

3567
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:01,350
So it's hard for me to 1v1.

3568
02:29:03,070 --> 02:29:03,810
Oh, okay.

3569
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:08,630
I'll do my ult and then swap because their...

3570
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:12,950
Their support backline is better versus for heals.

3571
02:29:14,410 --> 02:29:15,770
Wait, are we still fighting this?

3572
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:16,590
Yeah.

3573
02:29:17,230 --> 02:29:17,690
Oh, shit.

3574
02:29:17,710 --> 02:29:18,210
I died though.

3575
02:29:18,510 --> 02:29:19,630
Okay, I'm gonna stay here.

3576
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:20,910
I don't think we need to fight this.

3577
02:29:24,490 --> 02:29:24,970
No!

3578
02:29:25,550 --> 02:29:26,630
What did the Cloak come from?

3579
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:26,930
Okay.

3580
02:29:28,130 --> 02:29:28,950
Just sad.

3581
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:33,370
Alright, I'll use it on...

3582
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:36,510
I'll get... Yeah, I was like, I'm gonna get rid of this.

3583
02:29:37,730 --> 02:29:38,170
Goodbye!

3584
02:29:41,170 --> 02:29:44,130
What if they locked supports to only two per team?

3585
02:29:44,390 --> 02:29:45,050
Two per team?

3586
02:29:45,470 --> 02:29:46,970
Ooh, I would like that actually.

3587
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:51,970
What goes well against triple support?

3588
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:53,010
I guess I just play Hela.

3589
02:29:53,850 --> 02:29:54,690
Oh, nice!

3590
02:29:55,450 --> 02:29:57,870
I'll just play Hela just because we have a Thor.

3591
02:29:59,130 --> 02:30:00,810
And then we'll have the other team up.

3592
02:30:01,990 --> 02:30:04,390
I didn't think the Mantis would fucking run at me.

3593
02:30:04,690 --> 02:30:06,670
I ran up at the Mantis.

3594
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:07,270
I was like, hello?

3595
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:09,710
What are you doing here?

3596
02:30:11,030 --> 02:30:11,950
Don't you play her a lot?

3597
02:30:12,030 --> 02:30:12,890
Is that not how you play her?

3598
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:18,970
Yeah, but she's trying to solo without her team so it was very weird.

3599
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:24,890
You can technically burn it, but I don't even know if you have to.

3600
02:30:33,330 --> 02:30:33,870
Oh shit.

3601
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:37,010
There we go.

3602
02:30:37,770 --> 02:30:39,510
I killed the Mantis, but...

3603
02:30:42,170 --> 02:30:42,650
No!

3604
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:44,590
I was on point.

3605
02:30:46,650 --> 02:30:48,590
You could actually live on point with your ult.

3606
02:30:51,170 --> 02:30:52,170
But like, it's alright.

3607
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:55,930
Your ult is so strong, you can actually live on point.

3608
02:30:56,070 --> 02:31:01,590
Oh yeah, but I lagged out and I teleported somewhere else where I had no idea.

3609
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:03,990
It worked out though, I got out.

3610
02:31:04,430 --> 02:31:05,550
You're alive, you're alive.

3611
02:31:07,250 --> 02:31:08,810
Why do we still have rocket?

3612
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:12,890
Maybe I should have just ran Punisher because we have a rocket.

3613
02:31:15,710 --> 02:31:18,310
Yeah, he's playing with the buggy.

3614
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:19,390
Well, we just got one.

3615
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:20,610
Okay, nice.

3616
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:22,090
I might need heals, but...

3617
02:31:22,090 --> 02:31:24,250
Thank you.

3618
02:31:26,590 --> 02:31:27,530
She's still here?

3619
02:31:27,850 --> 02:31:28,810
Oh, she is.

3620
02:31:31,710 --> 02:31:32,450
Okay, nice.

3621
02:31:32,670 --> 02:31:33,610
She wasted it, she wasted it.

3622
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:38,470
She wasted that.

3623
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:41,170
No, I couldn't fly!

3624
02:31:41,410 --> 02:31:43,030
I did not fly anymore!

3625
02:31:43,750 --> 02:31:44,150
No!

3626
02:31:44,650 --> 02:31:46,750
I was trying to fly!

3627
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:48,130
Oh, okay.

3628
02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:48,730
That's fine.

3629
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,010
I'm fine with that.

3630
02:31:52,310 --> 02:31:52,970
No, I'm not.

3631
02:31:53,010 --> 02:31:53,550
I'm actually not.

3632
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:54,410
I'm not fine with that.

3633
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:56,690
Okay, we still have a healer.

3634
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:58,130
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3635
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:01,890
Did you fly out of it?

3636
02:32:01,890 --> 02:32:03,310
No, he like didn't.

3637
02:32:03,430 --> 02:32:04,390
I don't know what he was doing.

3638
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:05,370
He was playing really weird.

3639
02:32:08,410 --> 02:32:08,990
Okay, I'll ult.

3640
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:12,670
I'll wait for my ult before I use it.

3641
02:32:14,530 --> 02:32:16,330
As long as we're all here.

3642
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,750
Alright, bye ult.

3643
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:22,930
Bye ult!

3644
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:30,330
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

3645
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:32,630
I'm gonna need heals the moment I ult.

3646
02:32:33,430 --> 02:32:35,490
Goodbye, Sharky boy!

3647
02:32:38,530 --> 02:32:39,530
That's right.

3648
02:32:41,430 --> 02:32:42,250
Wait, what?

3649
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:42,870
I know Rek.

3650
02:32:42,970 --> 02:32:43,310
Goodbye.

3651
02:32:45,490 --> 02:32:46,750
There we go.

3652
02:32:47,970 --> 02:32:48,870
That's right!

3653
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:51,530
How dare you run triple support in gold!

3654
02:32:52,110 --> 02:32:53,570
How fucking dare you!

3655
02:32:53,810 --> 02:32:56,070
Gold is supposed to be a sanctuary!

3656
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:03,150
How fucking dare they!

3657
02:33:03,790 --> 02:33:08,010
Is there like a specific meta for 3 support or is it just any 3 support?

3658
02:33:08,210 --> 02:33:08,930
It's any 3 support.

3659
02:33:09,010 --> 02:33:11,650
Well, most likely it's Luna, Cloak.

3660
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:14,330
Luna, Cloak, and Invisible Woman.

3661
02:33:14,490 --> 02:33:16,650
Or Luna, Cloak, Mantis.

3662
02:33:16,850 --> 02:33:19,590
You have to have a Cloak and a Luna if you can.

3663
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:20,750
Cause they're like the strongest.

3664
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:21,650
And a Loki too.

3665
02:33:21,930 --> 02:33:25,690
So if you can't have Luna or Cloak, then you can substitute with Loki as well.

3666
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:33,150
But like, it's just, someone's like 3 support is like 24 7 diamond.

3667
02:33:33,450 --> 02:33:34,670
Please save us.

3668
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:38,750
I'm so sorry for the triple support players.

3669
02:33:40,050 --> 02:33:41,830
Is there no way to counter it really?

3670
02:33:42,110 --> 02:33:42,430
There is.

3671
02:33:42,530 --> 02:33:43,990
You can run triple DPS.

3672
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:47,230
Triple DPS, one tank.

3673
02:33:47,710 --> 02:33:51,870
And then a triple DPS has to like, you have to run magic with triple DPS.

3674
02:33:51,870 --> 02:33:54,770
Cause the magic can never die, basically.

3675
02:33:55,070 --> 02:33:56,890
And can get ult charged so fast.

3676
02:33:59,330 --> 02:34:03,770
And they can just farm the frontline over and over and over again.

3677
02:34:04,370 --> 02:34:09,990
And like, you have to have a Mag because a Mag can insta-kill like a support ult.

3678
02:34:14,250 --> 02:34:16,570
Other than that, you just run a better triple support.

3679
02:34:17,730 --> 02:34:21,410
What if they added like a character that had anti-heal?

3680
02:34:21,550 --> 02:34:22,650
Kind of like Ana's...

3681
02:34:22,650 --> 02:34:24,210
Oh, that would help a lot, yeah.

3682
02:34:24,490 --> 02:34:26,250
Anti-heal too would be really good.

3683
02:34:29,810 --> 02:34:33,530
Let's see, what does Captain Smackaho want to play?

3684
02:34:38,070 --> 02:34:40,550
I guess I'll try playing Luna Snow.

3685
02:34:40,850 --> 02:34:42,430
Wait, you can play DPS.

3686
02:34:42,910 --> 02:34:43,690
You want to play DPS?

3687
02:34:43,870 --> 02:34:44,930
I'll play Luna for you.

3688
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:47,690
Um, I'll just play second tank.

3689
02:34:49,550 --> 02:34:51,630
Would you rather play support or tank?

3690
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:53,650
I'll play tank.

3691
02:34:54,090 --> 02:34:55,770
Cause the guys asked for Luna Snow.

3692
02:34:55,870 --> 02:34:57,810
Yeah, but who cares about what he wants, though?

3693
02:34:59,010 --> 02:34:59,790
That's true, yeah.

3694
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:00,970
If he played Amour, it's a good team-up.

3695
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:02,290
Who cares about Chinny Chin?

3696
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:04,670
What do you want to play, Doobie?

3697
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:05,830
What do you want to play?

3698
02:35:05,830 --> 02:35:07,010
I like tank, I like tank.

3699
02:35:07,330 --> 02:35:07,930
Alright, alright.

3700
02:35:08,730 --> 02:35:11,770
It's kind of like the Stockholm Syndrome with tanks.

3701
02:35:13,110 --> 02:35:15,310
Queuing, nobody wants to play, so...

3702
02:35:15,310 --> 02:35:16,070
I like it now, though.

3703
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:16,490
I like it.

3704
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:17,770
Yeah, I like it.

3705
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:18,990
Yeah, I totally like it.

3706
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:20,130
You old, held hostage.

3707
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:21,930
Only if it's Penny Parker or Venom.

3708
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:22,630
I love it.

3709
02:35:24,850 --> 02:35:27,030
I do play in some games where they're like, can we get a strange?

3710
02:35:27,130 --> 02:35:28,850
And I'm like, oh, sorry, I only play Penny Parker.

3711
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:32,790
You can play tank.

3712
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:33,990
Yeah, exactly.

3713
02:35:34,150 --> 02:35:37,050
You can play tank if you want a strange.

3714
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:39,470
Alright.

3715
02:35:40,650 --> 02:35:42,750
You can't be making demands here.

3716
02:35:44,590 --> 02:35:46,870
I won't negotiate with Terius.

3717
02:35:51,590 --> 02:35:53,230
Alright, that's fine.

3718
02:35:54,810 --> 02:35:55,130
Where?

3719
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:56,610
You're fucking fully healed.

3720
02:35:56,770 --> 02:35:57,390
What do you want?

3721
02:35:58,750 --> 02:36:00,250
Don't be demanding.

3722
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:03,270
Because I will refuse to heal.

3723
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:08,630
Alright, this should be your rank up game, right?

3724
02:36:09,470 --> 02:36:11,130
Yeah, I'm like 9 points away.

3725
02:36:11,210 --> 02:36:12,730
Oh, this is... Okay, I'll full try.

3726
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:13,690
Don't worry.

3727
02:36:14,070 --> 02:36:15,550
I'll hit every fucking shot here.

3728
02:36:16,310 --> 02:36:18,370
Like, not... That's my first pass, though.

3729
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:19,170
Not this shot, though.

3730
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:20,630
But now, I'll hit every shot.

3731
02:36:20,710 --> 02:36:21,370
See, look at that.

3732
02:36:22,030 --> 02:36:23,810
Now that you're playing your main, I mean...

3733
02:36:23,810 --> 02:36:26,990
Yeah, now that I'm playing my main, I'm gonna hit everything.

3734
02:36:27,930 --> 02:36:28,630
Right here.

3735
02:36:29,370 --> 02:36:31,110
Nobody will die under my watch.

3736
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:33,250
And if they die, then like...

3737
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:34,350
I can't save, stupid.

3738
02:36:36,390 --> 02:36:37,810
Don't watch over them.

3739
02:36:39,450 --> 02:36:42,630
If they die, I intentionally wanted them to die.

3740
02:36:43,530 --> 02:36:46,230
Like, it was just a plan that I had.

3741
02:36:46,610 --> 02:36:47,410
Oh yeah, my ult, too.

3742
02:36:47,470 --> 02:36:47,930
That's crazy.

3743
02:36:50,010 --> 02:36:51,350
I got my ult so fast.

3744
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:53,550
Wait, just push forward.

3745
02:36:53,610 --> 02:36:53,930
Push forward.

3746
02:36:54,030 --> 02:36:54,310
Push forward.

3747
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:54,790
You won't die.

3748
02:36:54,850 --> 02:36:55,130
Trust me.

3749
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:55,650
Just push forward.

3750
02:36:56,130 --> 02:36:56,810
Just keep pushing forward.

3751
02:36:56,970 --> 02:36:57,430
You won't die.

3752
02:36:57,530 --> 02:36:57,870
Trust me.

3753
02:36:58,790 --> 02:36:59,670
Just keep pushing forward.

3754
02:37:00,350 --> 02:37:00,930
See, look at that.

3755
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:01,670
See, look at that.

3756
02:37:01,730 --> 02:37:02,230
Just keep going.

3757
02:37:02,310 --> 02:37:02,650
Keep going.

3758
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:04,250
You're so alive.

3759
02:37:04,350 --> 02:37:04,930
Keep going.

3760
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:09,850
You'll never die.

3761
02:37:10,010 --> 02:37:11,710
Oh my god, I can see you lagging.

3762
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:12,710
I see you.

3763
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:13,970
I see you.

3764
02:37:14,290 --> 02:37:15,750
It's because I'm playing on Wi-Fi.

3765
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,930
Wait, Wi-Fi?

3766
02:37:18,070 --> 02:37:24,950
Yeah, because I have Ethernet on my stream PC, but I haven't set up a special setup with my second Internet.

3767
02:37:25,270 --> 02:37:26,930
Yeah, that makes sense.

3768
02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:28,430
I was like, what?

3769
02:37:29,050 --> 02:37:31,150
Oh my god, that's crazy.

3770
02:37:31,150 --> 02:37:34,250
But I'm like right next to the Wi-Fi thing.

3771
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:36,550
Alright,

3772
02:37:39,810 --> 02:37:40,110
let's go.

3773
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:43,810
Double support ult because I waited for our cloak to ult and it took forever.

3774
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:47,130
I'm damage boosting it though, so something should happen technically.

3775
02:37:47,990 --> 02:37:50,270
I guess not, but that's okay.

3776
02:37:52,690 --> 02:37:55,330
Let's just use everything, you know?

3777
02:38:04,170 --> 02:38:05,330
Okay, Moon Knight!

3778
02:38:06,090 --> 02:38:08,150
Okay, he ulted the corner.

3779
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:10,970
That was crazy.

3780
02:38:10,970 --> 02:38:11,590
We didn't get it?

3781
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:12,270
We were so close.

3782
02:38:12,330 --> 02:38:12,970
No, we didn't.

3783
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:17,530
It was literally, we used every fucking ult except for our Neymor's ult.

3784
02:38:18,690 --> 02:38:19,990
They have Thor ult too.

3785
02:38:20,810 --> 02:38:22,250
The guy didn't use his Thor ult.

3786
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:24,490
They use all their support ults, so we're fine.

3787
02:38:25,370 --> 02:38:27,390
What the fuck are you trying to do putting an Ankh there?

3788
02:38:27,470 --> 02:38:28,470
Who are you trying to kill?

3789
02:38:29,170 --> 02:38:29,570
Ankh.

3790
02:38:29,570 --> 02:38:30,250
Okay.

3791
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:32,270
Yeah, the Ankh.

3792
02:38:33,070 --> 02:38:34,490
I'm gonna try and kill this Moon Knight.

3793
02:38:35,250 --> 02:38:36,010
Oh shit!

3794
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:37,010
Oh, nevermind!

3795
02:38:37,090 --> 02:38:39,330
I didn't realize the entire team was back there.

3796
02:38:39,730 --> 02:38:40,350
Are they in there?

3797
02:38:40,710 --> 02:38:42,490
Yeah, all of them are back there.

3798
02:38:42,530 --> 02:38:43,950
I was not expecting that.

3799
02:38:44,070 --> 02:38:44,950
I was like, wait a minute.

3800
02:38:46,030 --> 02:38:46,610
Oh no.

3801
02:38:46,930 --> 02:38:47,650
It's alright, I agree.

3802
02:38:47,710 --> 02:38:48,030
It's okay.

3803
02:38:48,950 --> 02:38:50,190
Keep that group up.

3804
02:38:51,610 --> 02:38:52,330
I'm just fine.

3805
02:38:54,930 --> 02:38:56,010
Who's he gonna try and kill?

3806
02:38:56,110 --> 02:38:56,570
Oh, her.

3807
02:38:58,290 --> 02:38:59,670
He's dead, I mean...

3808
02:38:59,670 --> 02:39:03,030
Yeah, like, I mean it's a good exchange because he's killed his support.

3809
02:39:03,710 --> 02:39:06,490
I'm just gonna... I'm just focusing on Cloak.

3810
02:39:06,990 --> 02:39:08,250
There you go, Cloak is dead.

3811
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:11,870
People play Thor in higher ranks?

3812
02:39:12,190 --> 02:39:13,670
There's four one-tricks, yeah.

3813
02:39:13,750 --> 02:39:14,730
He's not back there.

3814
02:39:15,210 --> 02:39:16,270
I don't find him.

3815
02:39:17,230 --> 02:39:22,930
I like, I had to frontline for our group.

3816
02:39:23,050 --> 02:39:24,210
He was behind me.

3817
02:39:26,570 --> 02:39:27,410
I was, like, scared.

3818
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:28,930
Groot, Groot, go up!

3819
02:39:28,990 --> 02:39:30,250
You're a big tree!

3820
02:39:31,350 --> 02:39:33,210
What are you scared of?

3821
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:35,270
You're a giant fucking tree!

3822
02:39:35,930 --> 02:39:36,630
Oh damn, Hawkeye.

3823
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:37,610
Now I have to actually play passive.

3824
02:39:40,450 --> 02:39:41,750
Now I have to be careful.

3825
02:39:42,130 --> 02:39:42,610
Wait, what?

3826
02:39:43,050 --> 02:39:43,530
Who's over there?

3827
02:39:45,190 --> 02:39:46,130
He was over there.

3828
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:49,970
Oh, I can kill this Hawkeye, I think.

3829
02:39:50,130 --> 02:39:50,750
Nope, he's getting me.

3830
02:39:50,770 --> 02:39:51,230
Yeah, he's low.

3831
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:53,810
Oh, he's... he is low, though.

3832
02:39:53,870 --> 02:39:54,450
He's still low.

3833
02:39:56,570 --> 02:39:58,570
Oh, I was reflexed.

3834
02:39:59,310 --> 02:40:01,470
Don't worry, we don't need our Moon Knight.

3835
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:03,010
He was useless.

3836
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:04,690
Is he doing it?

3837
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:06,090
Yeah, he's doing stuff.

3838
02:40:06,170 --> 02:40:06,590
He has 20 kills.

3839
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:08,470
Do not ult, Cloak!

3840
02:40:08,590 --> 02:40:09,710
Do not ult, Cloak!

3841
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:12,910
Oh, oh, that's fine.

3842
02:40:13,010 --> 02:40:13,870
I dodged it.

3843
02:40:14,650 --> 02:40:15,630
That's fine.

3844
02:40:16,070 --> 02:40:16,850
I dodged it.

3845
02:40:21,970 --> 02:40:23,730
I'm assuming you guys are over here.

3846
02:40:25,510 --> 02:40:27,830
Oh, you're so healthy, Syl!

3847
02:40:29,930 --> 02:40:30,750
Oh, you are not.

3848
02:40:30,850 --> 02:40:31,330
You're going to die.

3849
02:40:35,010 --> 02:40:41,490
Oh my god, when was these ults!

3850
02:40:41,910 --> 02:40:44,010
When were our Namor... wait, our Namor ults?

3851
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:44,450
When?

3852
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:49,530
When the fuck did our Namor ult?

3853
02:40:50,370 --> 02:40:52,350
Do you have any advice for getting out of Silver?

3854
02:40:53,450 --> 02:40:55,350
There's some people that are stuck there.

3855
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:59,690
For Silver, literally just play Rocky Raccoon.

3856
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:09,790
If you really, really want to get out of Silver, and you really, really want to climb, play Rocky Raccoon.

3857
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:11,850
He's that good?

3858
02:41:12,110 --> 02:41:13,650
He's that easy to climb.

3859
02:41:14,230 --> 02:41:16,910
He's one of the easiest characters to climb with.

3860
02:41:16,910 --> 02:41:17,870
Okay.

3861
02:41:19,210 --> 02:41:20,410
He is crazy.

3862
02:41:22,730 --> 02:41:23,850
I don't have Freeze.

3863
02:41:24,770 --> 02:41:26,150
I didn't have Freeze with me.

3864
02:41:27,050 --> 02:41:31,130
It's because his movement is so... He's unkillable in a lower ELO.

3865
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:39,710
He's unkillable in the lowest ELOs and stuff because his movement is really good.

3866
02:41:40,130 --> 02:41:42,070
So it's really easy to climb.

3867
02:41:42,470 --> 02:41:45,330
Just focus on dodging and everything.

3868
02:41:45,330 --> 02:41:48,610
But I hate Rocky Raccoon players that are KDA players.

3869
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,550
Because they do play like that.

3870
02:41:50,650 --> 02:41:52,550
Because they don't help with other support.

3871
02:41:52,730 --> 02:41:54,070
They play for their own lives.

3872
02:41:54,670 --> 02:41:58,450
So it's like one of the most tilting things when there's a KDA player.

3873
02:41:59,290 --> 02:42:01,230
Because they're so used to playing KDA.

3874
02:42:03,070 --> 02:42:04,210
I'm just up here getting whipped!

3875
02:42:06,850 --> 02:42:11,510
He's trying to... He's like, fuck this one particular Moon Knight.

3876
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:13,370
Your ult doesn't make you invincible!

3877
02:42:16,170 --> 02:42:16,630
Okay...

3878
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:20,010
That'd be crazy if he had like Life Steal or something like that.

3879
02:42:20,010 --> 02:42:23,870
Every time he Moon Knight ults, he like fucking walks into them.

3880
02:42:23,950 --> 02:42:25,190
And I'm like, Moon Knight, chill!

3881
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:27,230
Chill, buddy!

3882
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:30,250
Oh, I might be dead to this.

3883
02:42:30,450 --> 02:42:31,350
No, actually, I'm fine.

3884
02:42:32,090 --> 02:42:33,070
Our Cloak is, though.

3885
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:34,870
What?

3886
02:42:34,970 --> 02:42:35,210
Portal?

3887
02:42:36,010 --> 02:42:36,450
Why?

3888
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:41,770
It's where I do not look into it.

3889
02:42:41,770 --> 02:42:44,810
I ulted, but you are not invincible!

3890
02:42:45,430 --> 02:42:47,670
You are not invincible, Groot!

3891
02:42:47,990 --> 02:42:48,950
They have Strangelove.

3892
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:50,650
I don't know if I can freeze this in time.

3893
02:42:54,230 --> 02:42:55,730
Maybe I can web him.

3894
02:42:56,170 --> 02:42:57,950
Oh, the Pokedagger is super low.

3895
02:43:00,110 --> 02:43:00,530
Sorry!

3896
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:04,970
I used my freeze.

3897
02:43:05,210 --> 02:43:05,590
Did our Groot die?

3898
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:06,210
Oh, he did die.

3899
02:43:06,210 --> 02:43:07,770
Yeah, he was the first one to die.

3900
02:43:09,550 --> 02:43:10,910
I'm just gonna wait until...

3901
02:43:12,570 --> 02:43:13,010
Nice.

3902
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:14,970
We have ult.

3903
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:17,910
I used my freeze, so I fucked up.

3904
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:19,610
Because he has Strangelove.

3905
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:22,870
If he does it, maybe he won't use it in...

3906
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:26,450
Oh, nevermind, he used it.

3907
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:28,230
It's fine, I saved him.

3908
02:43:28,930 --> 02:43:29,930
I'm a fucking hero.

3909
02:43:31,910 --> 02:43:32,890
Did you freeze him?

3910
02:43:33,090 --> 02:43:36,130
Yeah, no, I froze him after the ult, so I'm a hero.

3911
02:43:37,150 --> 02:43:40,650
Oh god, I'm like teleporting and ulting at the same time.

3912
02:43:40,650 --> 02:43:42,510
And I feel so bad for the team.

3913
02:43:43,430 --> 02:43:45,590
I see, but you got people.

3914
02:43:46,970 --> 02:43:48,090
That's crazy.

3915
02:43:50,830 --> 02:43:54,090
Oh, I can't fucking jump there.

3916
02:43:54,530 --> 02:43:56,230
Don't leave the cart.

3917
02:43:57,090 --> 02:43:59,470
If you guys can live, we're like...

3918
02:43:59,470 --> 02:44:00,650
Oh nice, we killed him.

3919
02:44:01,290 --> 02:44:02,750
We killed the Disappear.

3920
02:44:05,290 --> 02:44:05,730
Alright.

3921
02:44:09,330 --> 02:44:10,950
There we go, we did it.

3922
02:44:11,530 --> 02:44:12,830
I feel like we'll do good on defense too.

3923
02:44:12,910 --> 02:44:13,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3924
02:44:13,950 --> 02:44:15,630
Groot and Penny are really good for defense.

3925
02:44:17,690 --> 02:44:19,290
Someone's like weaponized lag.

3926
02:44:19,390 --> 02:44:21,970
If you're lagging, that means they can't hit you.

3927
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:26,590
It's all part of my plan.

3928
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:27,310
Exactly.

3929
02:44:29,270 --> 02:44:31,410
You're like TPing around them.

3930
02:44:33,550 --> 02:44:35,590
I mean, it makes it's lore accurate.

3931
02:44:35,710 --> 02:44:36,130
Exactly.

3932
02:44:37,130 --> 02:44:37,950
That's true.

3933
02:44:39,190 --> 02:44:40,450
She's portal jumping.

3934
02:44:40,570 --> 02:44:41,710
She's playing with portals.

3935
02:44:44,210 --> 02:44:46,930
I believe in this full hold.

3936
02:44:47,830 --> 02:44:48,450
The Wi-Fi.

3937
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:49,870
I don't know how you can play with Wi-Fi.

3938
02:44:50,050 --> 02:44:50,590
That's crazy.

3939
02:44:51,110 --> 02:44:51,930
I don't usually.

3940
02:44:52,450 --> 02:44:54,850
It's just Wi-Fi because it's on my second PC right now.

3941
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:55,190
Yeah.

3942
02:44:57,050 --> 02:44:58,850
That's actually like very impressive.

3943
02:44:58,850 --> 02:45:04,310
I think I would actually freak out if I had to play on Wi-Fi.

3944
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:08,290
I was playing on low graphics too, but that's not too bad, right?

3945
02:45:08,290 --> 02:45:09,590
Yeah, everybody plays on low graphics.

3946
02:45:09,590 --> 02:45:10,770
I play on low graphics too.

3947
02:45:12,090 --> 02:45:13,250
It's just a gamer thing.

3948
02:45:13,350 --> 02:45:16,910
People will be like, wow, you have such a tanky PC, but yet you play everything on low.

3949
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:20,330
And you don't understand frames are much more important.

3950
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:26,990
Especially because I saw in this one, the more frames you have, the faster you move or something.

3951
02:45:27,350 --> 02:45:27,650
Yeah, yeah.

3952
02:45:27,650 --> 02:45:32,050
I know, like the more stuff you can do and shit, like that's so broken.

3953
02:45:32,330 --> 02:45:32,830
It's pay to win.

3954
02:45:32,990 --> 02:45:34,490
Yeah, it's literally pay to win.

3955
02:45:34,990 --> 02:45:36,310
The rich only gets richer.

3956
02:45:36,770 --> 02:45:37,810
They get everything.

3957
02:45:41,230 --> 02:45:43,290
The rich gets everything.

3958
02:45:45,950 --> 02:45:46,710
Yeah, frozen.

3959
02:45:49,470 --> 02:45:51,750
Oh my god, are you stupid, Neymar?

3960
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:59,670
I literally froze him in front of the...

3961
02:45:59,670 --> 02:46:00,770
Oh, I can't get to you.

3962
02:46:00,810 --> 02:46:01,650
No, no, no, no.

3963
02:46:01,650 --> 02:46:01,750
Sorry.

3964
02:46:02,430 --> 02:46:05,750
No, our Neymar ignored the fucking frozen stream.

3965
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:08,670
And then he was like, what's hitting me in the back?

3966
02:46:12,110 --> 02:46:14,390
Our Neymar was pretty dumb.

3967
02:46:15,210 --> 02:46:17,110
Headphones off, AFK.

3968
02:46:17,170 --> 02:46:18,270
Yeah, no, he's dumb.

3969
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:21,130
Literally, like, we all saw the portal.

3970
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:24,310
It's fine.

3971
02:46:24,530 --> 02:46:28,430
I can... I don't know if we should touch, but we can technically touch.

3972
02:46:29,610 --> 02:46:30,470
I'll try and get to you.

3973
02:46:30,710 --> 02:46:31,070
Here you go.

3974
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:33,470
Yeah, you can... I think you can touch it, right?

3975
02:46:33,890 --> 02:46:34,370
I... I...

3976
02:46:34,370 --> 02:46:35,130
Oh, never mind.

3977
02:46:35,410 --> 02:46:35,530
Nope.

3978
02:46:35,670 --> 02:46:36,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3979
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:36,430
Wait, wait, wait.

3980
02:46:36,470 --> 02:46:37,070
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

3981
02:46:37,170 --> 02:46:37,650
I'll keep you guys up.

3982
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:38,850
It's fine, it's fine.

3983
02:46:38,890 --> 02:46:40,270
You guys are still... You guys are still alive.

3984
02:46:40,310 --> 02:46:41,010
You guys are still alive.

3985
02:46:41,070 --> 02:46:41,750
I'm keeping you all up.

3986
02:46:41,790 --> 02:46:42,550
I'm keeping you all up.

3987
02:46:42,910 --> 02:46:43,650
You guys are still healthy.

3988
02:46:43,690 --> 02:46:44,570
I'm keeping you all...

3989
02:46:44,570 --> 02:46:45,430
Okay, not you though.

3990
02:46:45,650 --> 02:46:46,310
Not you though.

3991
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:47,910
Oh, no.

3992
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:49,010
Armed and dangerous.

3993
02:46:49,830 --> 02:46:51,590
No, so close.

3994
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:53,650
The armed and dangerous.

3995
02:46:56,010 --> 02:46:59,210
I can't believe I played Duna for this Namor.

3996
02:47:03,390 --> 02:47:06,590
I guess he's just a Namor one trick, probably.

3997
02:47:06,930 --> 02:47:09,530
A bad Namor one trick, I'm supposed to say it.

3998
02:47:10,470 --> 02:47:12,290
He was a... What the?

3999
02:47:13,250 --> 02:47:14,730
No, I got pulled.

4000
02:47:16,170 --> 02:47:17,130
I'm feeding.

4001
02:47:17,430 --> 02:47:19,710
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

4002
02:47:20,190 --> 02:47:22,510
Here we go.

4003
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:27,510
I'll make sure to kill you.

4004
02:47:32,250 --> 02:47:32,890
It's fine.

4005
02:47:32,990 --> 02:47:33,950
We stabilize this.

4006
02:47:34,230 --> 02:47:35,250
Because I kill too.

4007
02:47:36,310 --> 02:47:36,630
Nice.

4008
02:47:37,790 --> 02:47:38,630
Alright, nice.

4009
02:47:39,930 --> 02:47:42,590
I hope we have a cloak off for defensive later.

4010
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:44,570
That's what I hope for.

4011
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:46,670
Alright.

4012
02:47:47,330 --> 02:47:49,910
I can keep every... I think, but yeah, I can.

4013
02:47:51,410 --> 02:47:52,450
I'm saving my ship.

4014
02:47:52,570 --> 02:47:53,150
I'm saving my...

4015
02:47:55,030 --> 02:47:55,590
It's fine.

4016
02:47:56,410 --> 02:47:57,150
They fucked up.

4017
02:47:57,370 --> 02:47:58,310
They fucked up their ult.

4018
02:47:59,130 --> 02:47:59,930
Everybody lives!

4019
02:48:01,630 --> 02:48:02,430
Everybody lives!

4020
02:48:02,470 --> 02:48:02,870
Nice.

4021
02:48:03,370 --> 02:48:03,990
There we go!

4022
02:48:06,390 --> 02:48:07,450
Look at us go.

4023
02:48:08,030 --> 02:48:08,890
We all live.

4024
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:11,530
Oh, yeah.

4025
02:48:11,710 --> 02:48:13,850
You know, we don't... It's just three ults, you know?

4026
02:48:13,930 --> 02:48:14,610
It's just three ults.

4027
02:48:14,710 --> 02:48:15,690
We don't need those ults.

4028
02:48:18,650 --> 02:48:19,290
It's okay.

4029
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:20,290
We don't need them.

4030
02:48:22,350 --> 02:48:23,990
I can... Yeah, we don't need those ults.

4031
02:48:24,050 --> 02:48:25,390
Oh my god, I see you.

4032
02:48:28,010 --> 02:48:29,790
It's always so funny seeing you TP.

4033
02:48:32,330 --> 02:48:37,830
I think I... Yeah, I don't know what's going on with my internet.

4034
02:48:38,010 --> 02:48:38,870
It's really bad right now.

4035
02:48:39,270 --> 02:48:39,690
It's fine.

4036
02:48:39,810 --> 02:48:40,930
That means they're seeing it too.

4037
02:48:40,990 --> 02:48:42,170
If I see it, they see it.

4038
02:48:42,510 --> 02:48:42,890
Yeah.

4039
02:48:44,210 --> 02:48:45,490
Oh, they double support ulted.

4040
02:48:45,530 --> 02:48:45,890
That's good.

4041
02:48:48,770 --> 02:48:49,950
I think I'm gonna die.

4042
02:48:49,990 --> 02:48:50,250
Jesus Christ.

4043
02:48:50,490 --> 02:48:50,850
Jesus Christ.

4044
02:48:51,050 --> 02:48:51,290
Not yet.

4045
02:48:51,390 --> 02:48:51,630
Not yet.

4046
02:48:52,030 --> 02:48:52,230
Not yet.

4047
02:48:52,330 --> 02:48:52,510
Not yet.

4048
02:48:52,570 --> 02:48:52,830
Not yet.

4049
02:48:52,910 --> 02:48:52,950
Not yet.

4050
02:48:52,950 --> 02:48:53,390
Not yet.

4051
02:48:53,510 --> 02:48:53,710
Not yet.

4052
02:48:55,170 --> 02:48:55,850
Oh, okay.

4053
02:48:56,010 --> 02:48:56,130
Yep.

4054
02:48:56,210 --> 02:48:56,510
Yep.

4055
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:56,650
Yep.

4056
02:48:56,730 --> 02:48:56,830
Yep.

4057
02:48:58,170 --> 02:48:58,490
Yeah.

4058
02:48:59,310 --> 02:48:59,630
Yeah.

4059
02:49:01,950 --> 02:49:02,130
No.

4060
02:49:02,310 --> 02:49:02,490
No.

4061
02:49:02,590 --> 02:49:02,770
No.

4062
02:49:02,890 --> 02:49:03,170
Yeah.

4063
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:03,170
Yeah.

4064
02:49:03,370 --> 02:49:03,430
Yeah.

4065
02:49:03,970 --> 02:49:04,130
Yeah.

4066
02:49:04,130 --> 02:49:04,390
Yeah.

4067
02:49:10,490 --> 02:49:10,890
No.

4068
02:49:12,530 --> 02:49:12,690
No.

4069
02:49:12,770 --> 02:49:13,490
I almost got it.

4070
02:49:13,610 --> 02:49:13,890
No!

4071
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:16,170
I was trying to sneakily try and get my ult.

4072
02:49:16,310 --> 02:49:18,370
Cause I can... I could've saw it there.

4073
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:19,370
Oh, that sucks.

4074
02:49:19,950 --> 02:49:22,890
I legitimately could've got my ult there.

4075
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:25,250
If I didn't get shot by two people.

4076
02:49:26,650 --> 02:49:27,390
Oh, no.

4077
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:28,710
They have four minutes.

4078
02:49:28,810 --> 02:49:29,090
Okay.

4079
02:49:29,330 --> 02:49:30,450
They have four minutes.

4080
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:33,070
Alright.

4081
02:49:35,390 --> 02:49:35,790
Yeah.

4082
02:49:35,870 --> 02:49:37,930
I'll play more... I'm gonna play more smart now.

4083
02:49:38,570 --> 02:49:39,370
Knowing this.

4084
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:40,530
Alright.

4085
02:49:40,570 --> 02:49:42,890
I'm gonna keep my cooldowns until I actually need it.

4086
02:49:43,390 --> 02:49:43,890
Use it.

4087
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,370
Nice.

4088
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:45,310
We can push up with that.

4089
02:49:46,150 --> 02:49:46,290
Okay.

4090
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:47,570
Yeah.

4091
02:49:47,570 --> 02:49:48,450
Let's push up with that.

4092
02:49:50,090 --> 02:49:50,310
Yeah.

4093
02:49:50,390 --> 02:49:50,410
Yeah.

4094
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:50,730
Push up.

4095
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:50,890
Push up.

4096
02:49:50,930 --> 02:49:51,070
Push up.

4097
02:49:51,070 --> 02:49:51,430
Push up.

4098
02:49:51,610 --> 02:49:52,130
Let's go.

4099
02:49:53,150 --> 02:49:53,670
We're fine.

4100
02:49:53,730 --> 02:49:54,250
Our team is fine.

4101
02:49:54,350 --> 02:49:55,050
You just push up.

4102
02:49:55,690 --> 02:49:56,550
You just push up.

4103
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:58,210
You're gonna be fine.

4104
02:49:58,290 --> 02:49:59,010
Cause we killed three.

4105
02:49:59,790 --> 02:50:01,210
So, you don't have to worry.

4106
02:50:01,270 --> 02:50:02,610
There's support so he can't kill you.

4107
02:50:03,070 --> 02:50:04,210
I'm lagging.

4108
02:50:04,690 --> 02:50:05,490
It's okay.

4109
02:50:05,790 --> 02:50:07,010
Even if you're lagging, it's okay.

4110
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:07,790
Oh, shit.

4111
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:08,250
Nevermind.

4112
02:50:08,490 --> 02:50:08,790
Nevermind.

4113
02:50:09,010 --> 02:50:14,270
I can't trust you.

4114
02:50:16,050 --> 02:50:18,130
I forgot about the lag part.

4115
02:50:18,490 --> 02:50:19,830
That was my bad.

4116
02:50:21,190 --> 02:50:23,890
That was actually... I was like, oh shit, you're lagging.

4117
02:50:24,030 --> 02:50:25,450
I forgot all about that.

4118
02:50:29,050 --> 02:50:29,550
It's okay.

4119
02:50:29,810 --> 02:50:30,290
It's okay.

4120
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:33,690
Oh, drop down if you need heals because there's the cloak up.

4121
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:34,330
Oh, okay.

4122
02:50:34,450 --> 02:50:34,510
Nice.

4123
02:50:36,810 --> 02:50:37,570
I almost forgot.

4124
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:38,730
That was my bad.

4125
02:50:38,950 --> 02:50:40,750
I forgot about the most important part.

4126
02:50:47,230 --> 02:50:47,850
It's okay.

4127
02:50:47,930 --> 02:50:48,490
Just keep running.

4128
02:50:48,990 --> 02:50:50,170
Just keep running.

4129
02:50:51,210 --> 02:50:52,150
Just keep running.

4130
02:50:53,230 --> 02:50:53,910
He has change up.

4131
02:50:54,030 --> 02:50:54,730
Oh my god.

4132
02:50:54,790 --> 02:50:56,090
I got pushed back.

4133
02:50:56,090 --> 02:50:57,770
Holy shit.

4134
02:50:57,950 --> 02:51:02,110
Oh no.

4135
02:51:03,630 --> 02:51:05,530
I can't outheal all this.

4136
02:51:05,750 --> 02:51:06,890
There's too many.

4137
02:51:09,110 --> 02:51:09,910
You're dead.

4138
02:51:09,990 --> 02:51:10,390
You're dead.

4139
02:51:10,450 --> 02:51:11,030
It's okay.

4140
02:51:12,430 --> 02:51:13,450
That's where you were.

4141
02:51:13,510 --> 02:51:14,090
You were dead.

4142
02:51:16,310 --> 02:51:18,130
If you're curious where you were.

4143
02:51:19,410 --> 02:51:20,430
Are you serious?

4144
02:51:20,550 --> 02:51:21,630
I get solo ulted?

4145
02:51:21,710 --> 02:51:23,250
That fucking freak.

4146
02:51:26,090 --> 02:51:26,510
You're such a freak.

4147
02:51:26,610 --> 02:51:27,050
You're such a freak.

4148
02:51:35,060 --> 02:51:35,800
You're next.

4149
02:51:37,280 --> 02:51:38,580
Oh my god.

4150
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:40,140
He's trying to stall.

4151
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:42,040
Me too.

4152
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,480
Get on point.

4153
02:51:47,660 --> 02:51:48,080
DPS.

4154
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:51,000
Why can't you ult but not on point?

4155
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:55,320
Why can't you ult but not on point?

4156
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:57,020
You could've stood in his ult, right?

4157
02:51:57,220 --> 02:51:57,500
Yeah.

4158
02:51:57,740 --> 02:52:02,200
He literally ulted and then he didn't even go into the ult.

4159
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:05,000
I'm so tempted to be like, let me play DPS.

4160
02:52:05,340 --> 02:52:06,020
I can't.

4161
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:07,100
You guys are hopeless.

4162
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:12,280
I don't think he'll give up DPS anyway.

4163
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:14,480
I think Cap the Moon Knight is good.

4164
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:15,380
But Chinny Chin?

4165
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:17,600
He needs to swap his career.

4166
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,160
Chinny Chin was the problem.

4167
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:24,880
Captain Smack was doing okay.

4168
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:26,360
And also...

4169
02:52:26,360 --> 02:52:27,640
Our group feeds so hard.

4170
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:32,780
I can't even out heal it too.

4171
02:52:33,460 --> 02:52:35,840
I feel like the first round I was feeding a little bit.

4172
02:52:35,900 --> 02:52:37,660
But this one I tried to play more safe.

4173
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:39,960
But it's still...

4174
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:41,160
I don't play Magneto.

4175
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:43,360
You can play Magneto.

4176
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:50,920
Oh, Chinny Chin.

4177
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:51,900
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4178
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:54,580
I'll play DPS and then you can play support.

4179
02:52:57,660 --> 02:53:00,760
And then you can play...

4180
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:01,220
There we go.

4181
02:53:01,780 --> 02:53:02,920
I'll play Psylocke.

4182
02:53:04,220 --> 02:53:04,800
Actually...

4183
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:06,920
I'll play Psylocke, yeah.

4184
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:09,320
Alright.

4185
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:12,200
Locked in.

4186
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,340
This might be a little difficult.

4187
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:15,900
But lock in time.

4188
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:24,580
Oh, actually...

4189
02:53:24,580 --> 02:53:26,480
Can they play when it's not lagging?

4190
02:53:26,740 --> 02:53:28,380
Wait, you're right.

4191
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:29,200
I just remembered.

4192
02:53:32,180 --> 02:53:34,940
It's strange just trying to...

4193
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:36,920
I had to...

4194
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:38,140
Oh, nice.

4195
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:42,780
Okay.

4196
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:44,720
Wait!

4197
02:53:44,860 --> 02:53:45,320
Oh, shit!

4198
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:49,080
Okay, I got one.

4199
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:53,360
I got two.

4200
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:54,720
Nice.

4201
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:57,200
Oh, my snowflake!

4202
02:53:57,440 --> 02:53:58,500
Where's my snowflake?

4203
02:53:58,520 --> 02:53:59,280
Oh, no!

4204
02:53:59,740 --> 02:54:00,380
It's okay.

4205
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:03,080
I got three.

4206
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:03,600
It's okay.

4207
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:06,760
It's okay.

4208
02:54:07,640 --> 02:54:09,300
Keep the snowflake on me.

4209
02:54:10,320 --> 02:54:12,480
And then I can kill everything, I think.

4210
02:54:12,480 --> 02:54:13,340
I think I can.

4211
02:54:17,050 --> 02:54:18,770
It only heals when I'm healing, right?

4212
02:54:18,790 --> 02:54:20,870
Yeah, you can heal me with it and I get double the healing.

4213
02:54:20,990 --> 02:54:21,990
And then you can heal other people.

4214
02:54:21,990 --> 02:54:24,370
You heal other people and I get the heals, too.

4215
02:54:24,770 --> 02:54:27,990
So that's why they keep it...

4216
02:54:27,990 --> 02:54:29,530
Keep it on me.

4217
02:54:29,650 --> 02:54:31,130
So then I can... I'm behind you.

4218
02:54:31,470 --> 02:54:32,210
Look at me.

4219
02:54:32,830 --> 02:54:33,630
Okay, nice.

4220
02:54:38,590 --> 02:54:39,450
Oh, shit!

4221
02:54:39,490 --> 02:54:40,470
That's so much damage!

4222
02:54:41,430 --> 02:54:43,130
I couldn't even outlive that.

4223
02:54:44,310 --> 02:54:46,170
You can snowflake somebody else for now.

4224
02:54:46,490 --> 02:54:47,270
Because I...

4225
02:54:47,650 --> 02:54:49,990
I was just front tanking it.

4226
02:54:50,050 --> 02:54:50,170
I'm dead.

4227
02:54:50,370 --> 02:54:50,590
I'm dead.

4228
02:54:50,590 --> 02:54:50,990
Oh, no.

4229
02:54:52,570 --> 02:54:53,350
It's fine.

4230
02:54:53,430 --> 02:54:54,290
You're so healthy.

4231
02:54:55,030 --> 02:54:55,610
We're good.

4232
02:54:55,910 --> 02:54:57,150
Guys, just stay alive.

4233
02:54:58,130 --> 02:54:59,130
I believe.

4234
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:04,830
I need somebody else to be alive on this.

4235
02:55:05,510 --> 02:55:05,730
No!

4236
02:55:06,030 --> 02:55:06,530
I can't!

4237
02:55:07,350 --> 02:55:08,230
That's unlucky.

4238
02:55:08,930 --> 02:55:10,530
I thought someone else was alive.

4239
02:55:11,210 --> 02:55:12,950
I was so close to hitting my ult.

4240
02:55:14,090 --> 02:55:15,150
That's so unlucky.

4241
02:55:17,630 --> 02:55:21,310
If I'm in my ult form, I can't do anything.

4242
02:55:24,150 --> 02:55:25,490
I didn't try to play.

4243
02:55:26,110 --> 02:55:27,590
Yeah, just keep the snowflake on me.

4244
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:29,050
And I'll play more conservative.

4245
02:55:30,090 --> 02:55:30,150
Yeah.

4246
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:35,630
And I'll try and just pick off the supports.

4247
02:55:36,730 --> 02:55:38,770
I can play way far in the back, right?

4248
02:55:38,970 --> 02:55:41,230
Yeah, you don't have to play close.

4249
02:55:41,490 --> 02:55:44,230
The moment you heal them, I get healed.

4250
02:55:45,270 --> 02:55:45,710
Okay.

4251
02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:46,130
Okay.

4252
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:49,590
Yeah, because my ult form makes it so that I don't...

4253
02:55:49,590 --> 02:55:50,610
I stop existing.

4254
02:55:51,090 --> 02:55:53,370
I just don't exist.

4255
02:55:57,090 --> 02:56:01,070
Pretty sure my friends who are watching me play Psylocke are like, oh my god.

4256
02:56:01,390 --> 02:56:02,090
Get off Psylocke.

4257
02:56:03,610 --> 02:56:04,770
What are you doing?

4258
02:56:05,310 --> 02:56:07,870
They're like, what the fuck are you doing?

4259
02:56:09,070 --> 02:56:10,210
What are you...

4260
02:56:10,210 --> 02:56:12,410
What the fuck is this game playing?

4261
02:56:12,410 --> 02:56:12,590
What is this game?

4262
02:56:14,490 --> 02:56:15,930
Oh my god, are you dumb?

4263
02:56:17,850 --> 02:56:18,650
I'm sorry.

4264
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:20,950
I'm gold.

4265
02:56:24,970 --> 02:56:26,150
I'm just gold.

4266
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:29,390
I mean, if you have a DPS only account...

4267
02:56:29,390 --> 02:56:31,090
I remember people in Overwatch would do that.

4268
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:31,730
Yeah.

4269
02:56:34,350 --> 02:56:35,330
I don't know.

4270
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:36,630
DPS is so stressful to play.

4271
02:56:36,810 --> 02:56:37,990
That's why I don't play DPS.

4272
02:56:37,990 --> 02:56:39,690
It's just way too stressful.

4273
02:56:40,430 --> 02:56:42,270
What the fuck is he doing?

4274
02:56:51,300 --> 02:56:52,440
I'm just waiting.

4275
02:56:58,350 --> 02:56:58,970
Whoa.

4276
02:57:03,790 --> 02:57:04,570
Let's see.

4277
02:57:04,870 --> 02:57:07,450
I'm gonna try and annoy the supports real fast.

4278
02:57:08,270 --> 02:57:08,730
Oh no.

4279
02:57:09,390 --> 02:57:10,450
I should've gone around.

4280
02:57:11,550 --> 02:57:12,610
I didn't think they were that close.

4281
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:16,890
I'm contesting point.

4282
02:57:16,990 --> 02:57:17,530
Oh shit.

4283
02:57:18,990 --> 02:57:19,610
Oh.

4284
02:57:20,030 --> 02:57:21,630
I was contesting point.

4285
02:57:21,850 --> 02:57:24,530
But our teammates are not having a good time.

4286
02:57:27,610 --> 02:57:28,850
I mean...

4287
02:57:28,850 --> 02:57:30,650
I got a contestant.

4288
02:57:33,770 --> 02:57:35,010
Oh no.

4289
02:57:35,550 --> 02:57:35,890
What?

4290
02:57:36,870 --> 02:57:38,610
I got pulled.

4291
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:40,270
But I think it's the lag.

4292
02:57:40,890 --> 02:57:43,830
I used my freeze on him before he pulled me.

4293
02:57:43,930 --> 02:57:44,590
But it didn't register.

4294
02:57:45,470 --> 02:57:46,230
Oh no.

4295
02:57:46,330 --> 02:57:47,910
Our Venom is going fucking crazy.

4296
02:57:48,770 --> 02:57:49,330
Venom!

4297
02:57:49,690 --> 02:57:52,430
He just ran into it.

4298
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:01,140
Okay, I got Bucky.

4299
02:58:01,300 --> 02:58:02,320
But that's it.

4300
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:03,440
That's all I can do.

4301
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:09,900
I got a kill.

4302
02:58:10,040 --> 02:58:11,700
But I couldn't do anything else.

4303
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:16,140
We were so close.

4304
02:58:16,140 --> 02:58:17,760
I think if I saw...

4305
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:20,360
I think if ChinnyChin played Mag earlier...

4306
02:58:20,360 --> 02:58:22,060
I think we could've won that.

4307
02:58:22,480 --> 02:58:22,640
Yeah.

4308
02:58:25,240 --> 02:58:26,540
Oh my god.

4309
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:27,540
It's okay.

4310
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:29,200
That game...

4311
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:31,020
We don't need to avoid people.

4312
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:32,500
Because there are so many players in gold.

4313
02:58:33,060 --> 02:58:33,580
Yeah.

4314
02:58:34,880 --> 02:58:37,100
It's unlikely we would get anybody else.

4315
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:38,940
I feel like we haven't bumped into people.

4316
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:43,460
We haven't bumped into the same players.

4317
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:44,540
At all.

4318
02:58:45,540 --> 02:58:48,240
It must be pretty common for a higher rank rank.

4319
02:58:48,260 --> 02:58:49,460
Yeah, because there are less people.

4320
02:58:50,340 --> 02:58:50,820
But...

4321
02:58:50,820 --> 02:58:53,200
I haven't seen...

4322
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:54,820
The players...

4323
02:58:55,460 --> 02:58:57,060
The players we bumped into in here.

4324
02:58:57,360 --> 02:58:58,460
It's all new guys.

4325
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:04,470
I believe...

4326
02:59:04,470 --> 02:59:06,010
This is a game where...

4327
02:59:06,010 --> 02:59:08,390
We are going to win two in a row.

4328
02:59:08,530 --> 02:59:09,050
I believe.

4329
02:59:09,150 --> 02:59:10,090
And then you are going to be plat.

4330
02:59:10,850 --> 02:59:11,770
Let's go!

4331
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:13,110
There is no way.

4332
02:59:13,310 --> 02:59:15,330
Nothing bad will happen to us.

4333
02:59:16,090 --> 02:59:17,230
Well, I mean...

4334
02:59:17,230 --> 02:59:18,350
That's just asking for it.

4335
02:59:18,690 --> 02:59:22,210
Nothing bad is going to happen to us.

4336
02:59:22,530 --> 02:59:24,170
We are not going to go into...

4337
02:59:24,170 --> 02:59:24,910
A five game...

4338
02:59:24,910 --> 02:59:27,310
A five game loss streak or anything.

4339
02:59:27,950 --> 02:59:29,310
I would like Ironman.

4340
02:59:29,410 --> 02:59:30,090
Do we have Hulk?

4341
02:59:30,670 --> 02:59:32,810
Do we have a Hulk player?

4342
02:59:33,050 --> 02:59:33,830
Question mark.

4343
02:59:35,650 --> 02:59:36,170
No, okay.

4344
02:59:36,190 --> 02:59:37,070
If I pick Ironman...

4345
02:59:37,070 --> 02:59:39,430
And they don't play Hulk, then it's obvious...

4346
02:59:39,430 --> 02:59:41,430
They are not a Hulk player.

4347
02:59:42,290 --> 02:59:42,850
Yeah.

4348
02:59:43,610 --> 02:59:44,010
Yeah.

4349
02:59:44,070 --> 02:59:46,230
Like I said, it's really hard to find tank players.

4350
02:59:46,470 --> 02:59:47,030
Oh, there we go.

4351
02:59:47,490 --> 02:59:50,990
But they are playing Brute though.

4352
02:59:51,490 --> 02:59:51,810
Brute.

4353
02:59:52,430 --> 02:59:54,070
A good Hulk player is so scary.

4354
02:59:54,990 --> 02:59:55,390
Yeah.

4355
02:59:57,490 --> 02:59:58,110
Let's see.

4356
02:59:58,290 --> 03:00:00,070
Let's see if I can get away with Ironman.

4357
03:00:00,150 --> 03:00:02,850
I just want to play Ironman for the right click.

4358
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:05,090
Because the right click...

4359
03:00:05,090 --> 03:00:05,510
The clips, right?

4360
03:00:05,810 --> 03:00:07,090
The Jarvis clips.

4361
03:00:07,330 --> 03:00:08,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4362
03:00:08,070 --> 03:00:10,810
That and then the right click is really...

4363
03:00:10,810 --> 03:00:12,110
The right click is the only tracking.

4364
03:00:12,970 --> 03:00:13,470
In the game.

4365
03:00:14,630 --> 03:00:15,690
And there's not a lot of...

4366
03:00:15,690 --> 03:00:17,510
Yeah, there's not a lot of characters that are tracking.

4367
03:00:18,170 --> 03:00:20,110
Oh, fucking let's go!

4368
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:21,810
Let's fucking go!

4369
03:00:22,610 --> 03:00:23,850
Oh my god!

4370
03:00:24,370 --> 03:00:25,330
Freeze ball.

4371
03:00:26,090 --> 03:00:27,910
Can I have Snowflake?

4372
03:00:28,770 --> 03:00:30,070
I'll just be like...

4373
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:33,070
Oh my god, come on.

4374
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:34,030
Yes!

4375
03:00:34,910 --> 03:00:35,190
Yes!

4376
03:00:35,190 --> 03:00:36,570
It's perfect!

4377
03:00:37,090 --> 03:00:38,430
It's perfect!

4378
03:00:38,750 --> 03:00:40,650
I am the most optimal Ironman.

4379
03:00:40,710 --> 03:00:41,730
I'm gonna die instantly.

4380
03:00:43,630 --> 03:00:48,830
I'm gonna die instantly after I got everything I ever wanted in life.

4381
03:00:51,230 --> 03:00:56,210
I can feel it.

4382
03:01:02,430 --> 03:01:04,030
Gamma time.

4383
03:01:04,030 --> 03:01:05,190
Gamma time.

4384
03:01:06,470 --> 03:01:07,330
Oh no!

4385
03:01:07,770 --> 03:01:09,870
Oh my god!

4386
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:11,930
How is he still alive?

4387
03:01:12,810 --> 03:01:14,170
Holy shit!

4388
03:01:14,450 --> 03:01:15,350
They're gonna have ult soon.

4389
03:01:15,870 --> 03:01:18,030
They're 100% gonna have...

4390
03:01:18,690 --> 03:01:20,430
Ult for...

4391
03:01:20,430 --> 03:01:20,790
Support.

4392
03:01:21,090 --> 03:01:21,870
There's no way.

4393
03:01:22,230 --> 03:01:24,030
I literally...

4394
03:01:24,810 --> 03:01:26,270
I healed a bunch of damage.

4395
03:01:26,370 --> 03:01:26,990
I farmed...

4396
03:01:26,990 --> 03:01:28,530
I farmed all...

4397
03:01:29,750 --> 03:01:30,110
Nice.

4398
03:01:31,230 --> 03:01:31,990
Like...

4399
03:01:31,990 --> 03:01:34,210
I literally got...

4400
03:01:34,210 --> 03:01:35,670
Ult from this one group.

4401
03:01:35,850 --> 03:01:37,330
It's actually crazy.

4402
03:01:39,770 --> 03:01:41,290
Holy shit.

4403
03:01:41,730 --> 03:01:43,710
I was like, Jesus Christ.

4404
03:01:43,890 --> 03:01:45,370
How is he still alive?

4405
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:48,570
Oh, portal.

4406
03:01:49,250 --> 03:01:49,410
Yep.

4407
03:01:53,150 --> 03:01:56,130
I have to play like...

4408
03:01:57,490 --> 03:01:58,410
Come on.

4409
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:59,310
That's great.

4410
03:02:01,210 --> 03:02:02,010
Alright, nice.

4411
03:02:02,190 --> 03:02:06,010
Oh shit!

4412
03:02:06,990 --> 03:02:07,350
It's fine.

4413
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:08,830
We're alive.

4414
03:02:10,970 --> 03:02:11,690
It's fine.

4415
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:13,170
We have local ult too.

4416
03:02:14,890 --> 03:02:15,410
Yeah.

4417
03:02:16,330 --> 03:02:17,230
It's worth it.

4418
03:02:18,190 --> 03:02:18,790
It's worth it.

4419
03:02:18,790 --> 03:02:19,370
I have ult too.

4420
03:02:20,110 --> 03:02:22,210
That Groot is literally just letting me farm...

4421
03:02:22,210 --> 03:02:22,810
on him.

4422
03:02:24,450 --> 03:02:25,570
It's actually crazy.

4423
03:02:25,730 --> 03:02:27,270
I did not expect me to get...

4424
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:28,070
an ult that fast.

4425
03:02:28,250 --> 03:02:29,910
I was just like, alright.

4426
03:02:32,230 --> 03:02:33,750
It was the beam, right?

4427
03:02:33,890 --> 03:02:34,130
Yeah.

4428
03:02:34,370 --> 03:02:35,890
We just used the beam.

4429
03:02:39,390 --> 03:02:41,010
I'm lagging really fast.

4430
03:02:41,010 --> 03:02:41,430
Oh shit.

4431
03:02:41,550 --> 03:02:41,790
It's fine.

4432
03:02:42,290 --> 03:02:42,630
Don't worry.

4433
03:02:42,690 --> 03:02:43,250
We got you.

4434
03:02:47,470 --> 03:02:48,050
It's fine.

4435
03:02:48,090 --> 03:02:49,370
I'm just gonna spam my heals.

4436
03:02:49,870 --> 03:02:50,330
So...

4437
03:02:50,330 --> 03:02:52,690
I think he...

4438
03:02:53,830 --> 03:02:55,330
Oh my god.

4439
03:02:56,290 --> 03:02:56,710
Clip it!

4440
03:02:56,810 --> 03:02:57,190
Clip it!

4441
03:02:57,210 --> 03:02:58,370
Clip it Jarvis!

4442
03:02:58,530 --> 03:02:59,170
Clip it!

4443
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:04,850
Clip it!

4444
03:03:06,450 --> 03:03:07,190
Alright.

4445
03:03:07,980 --> 03:03:08,950
1-3.

4446
03:03:09,770 --> 03:03:10,270
There we go.

4447
03:03:13,410 --> 03:03:14,790
Jarvis, clip that!

4448
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:16,670
Wait, what?

4449
03:03:17,110 --> 03:03:17,410
Hello.

4450
03:03:17,410 --> 03:03:18,490
Hello Luna.

4451
03:03:18,950 --> 03:03:20,190
Hello Luna.

4452
03:03:20,890 --> 03:03:21,670
Goodbye Luna.

4453
03:03:24,290 --> 03:03:26,390
Let me farm you!

4454
03:03:26,610 --> 03:03:30,770
For the next round.

4455
03:03:37,130 --> 03:03:38,630
Okay, I'm gonna be nice.

4456
03:03:39,210 --> 03:03:40,470
I'm gonna be super...

4457
03:03:40,470 --> 03:03:41,870
nice to my Luna.

4458
03:03:44,230 --> 03:03:46,290
You know what it's like to be...

4459
03:03:46,290 --> 03:03:47,330
in that position.

4460
03:03:47,330 --> 03:03:48,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4461
03:03:48,470 --> 03:03:50,350
I'm just gonna be super nice to our Luna.

4462
03:03:50,550 --> 03:03:52,590
Can I please have the...

4463
03:03:52,590 --> 03:03:53,970
Thank you Luna.

4464
03:03:55,650 --> 03:03:57,330
She's not giving me snowflake.

4465
03:03:58,150 --> 03:03:58,750
Luna, please.

4466
03:03:58,870 --> 03:03:59,730
I did so much.

4467
03:04:00,070 --> 03:04:02,510
Did you not see the cool ults I did, Luna?

4468
03:04:03,170 --> 03:04:04,310
Luna, please.

4469
03:04:04,430 --> 03:04:06,050
I was freaking carrying Luna.

4470
03:04:06,250 --> 03:04:07,090
I'm gonna hump you.

4471
03:04:14,110 --> 03:04:16,890
Don't make me do it.

4472
03:04:18,790 --> 03:04:19,810
Don't make me do it.

4473
03:04:21,270 --> 03:04:22,190
Chad's confused.

4474
03:04:22,310 --> 03:04:22,790
They're like, what?

4475
03:04:23,670 --> 03:04:24,650
Don't make me do this.

4476
03:04:26,410 --> 03:04:28,470
She's not giving me the snowflake.

4477
03:04:28,950 --> 03:04:30,930
I even said thank you.

4478
03:04:32,210 --> 03:04:34,210
I don't think she's giving it to anyone.

4479
03:04:34,490 --> 03:04:35,890
Oh my god.

4480
03:04:35,970 --> 03:04:38,130
I even said thank you.

4481
03:04:38,310 --> 03:04:38,910
They don't have portal.

4482
03:04:40,630 --> 03:04:42,550
So they'll just be slowly walking.

4483
03:04:42,750 --> 03:04:43,130
Somewhere.

4484
03:04:43,130 --> 03:04:44,690
There it is.

4485
03:04:51,610 --> 03:04:53,030
Oh, thank you.

4486
03:04:53,510 --> 03:04:54,370
Oh no.

4487
03:04:54,890 --> 03:04:57,710
The moment she gruted the support.

4488
03:04:57,870 --> 03:04:58,810
It's okay, I killed Groot though.

4489
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:02,730
Our Luna should be ulting.

4490
03:05:03,150 --> 03:05:05,130
Our Luna is a little...

4491
03:05:05,130 --> 03:05:06,630
Maybe is a little special.

4492
03:05:08,510 --> 03:05:09,810
She should have ulted.

4493
03:05:09,830 --> 03:05:10,410
I don't understand.

4494
03:05:11,290 --> 03:05:13,570
If she ulted this, we could have...

4495
03:05:13,570 --> 03:05:16,110
Oh no, not the...

4496
03:05:16,110 --> 03:05:16,650
Oh nice.

4497
03:05:18,030 --> 03:05:19,750
I'll play on this then.

4498
03:05:21,530 --> 03:05:22,110
Okay.

4499
03:05:23,610 --> 03:05:24,410
Alright.

4500
03:05:24,810 --> 03:05:27,590
I don't know why she...

4501
03:05:30,230 --> 03:05:32,610
Wait, our Luna ulted?

4502
03:05:32,830 --> 03:05:33,230
Okay.

4503
03:05:36,410 --> 03:05:37,210
Alright.

4504
03:05:37,670 --> 03:05:38,470
Alright, Luna.

4505
03:05:40,570 --> 03:05:42,090
That was weird.

4506
03:05:42,690 --> 03:05:43,850
Just regroup.

4507
03:05:43,850 --> 03:05:44,570
Just regroup.

4508
03:05:45,430 --> 03:05:45,590
Or...

4509
03:05:46,810 --> 03:05:48,710
Our other player is not going to regroup.

4510
03:05:48,850 --> 03:05:49,190
But that's okay.

4511
03:05:52,010 --> 03:05:52,670
I'm fine.

4512
03:05:53,190 --> 03:05:54,510
I'm just farming ult again.

4513
03:05:55,370 --> 03:05:55,970
Wait, I have ult.

4514
03:05:57,430 --> 03:05:57,970
There we go.

4515
03:05:58,850 --> 03:05:59,970
Okay, I need heals though.

4516
03:06:00,010 --> 03:06:01,370
I'm like, oh wait, it's okay, I'm fine.

4517
03:06:02,070 --> 03:06:02,790
I killed two.

4518
03:06:02,910 --> 03:06:04,050
Yeah, we're down to healer right now.

4519
03:06:04,550 --> 03:06:05,390
Yeah, I killed two though.

4520
03:06:05,890 --> 03:06:06,610
It should be fine.

4521
03:06:06,610 --> 03:06:10,330
It should be fine.

4522
03:06:10,550 --> 03:06:12,030
Alright, I got Scarlet.

4523
03:06:12,070 --> 03:06:13,010
Oh, no, not Scarlet.

4524
03:06:13,090 --> 03:06:13,650
I got Luna.

4525
03:06:13,990 --> 03:06:15,190
Oh, nevermind.

4526
03:06:15,590 --> 03:06:17,490
I guess I don't got anybody.

4527
03:06:18,150 --> 03:06:19,930
Oh, he wasted it.

4528
03:06:22,110 --> 03:06:22,710
Alright.

4529
03:06:24,450 --> 03:06:26,950
Woah, woah, woah.

4530
03:06:27,150 --> 03:06:27,930
Woah, woah, woah.

4531
03:06:28,370 --> 03:06:29,170
I'm okay.

4532
03:06:29,790 --> 03:06:31,190
I'm so healthy still.

4533
03:06:32,630 --> 03:06:33,810
I'm so healthy.

4534
03:06:33,810 --> 03:06:36,630
I'm on 3 HP, but I got two before I died.

4535
03:06:36,730 --> 03:06:39,990
I got two before I died.

4536
03:06:40,090 --> 03:06:40,810
That's good enough.

4537
03:06:44,450 --> 03:06:44,950
Okay.

4538
03:06:47,010 --> 03:06:47,450
Oh, no.

4539
03:06:47,610 --> 03:06:48,470
Our Luna still died.

4540
03:06:49,130 --> 03:06:49,670
Oh, no.

4541
03:06:52,750 --> 03:06:53,390
I'm dead.

4542
03:06:54,430 --> 03:06:56,060
No supports right now.

4543
03:06:58,030 --> 03:06:58,930
Well, that's bad.

4544
03:06:59,030 --> 03:07:00,070
That's bad actually for me.

4545
03:07:00,850 --> 03:07:02,510
That's actually bad for me.

4546
03:07:04,930 --> 03:07:06,030
They have it.

4547
03:07:06,110 --> 03:07:06,630
They got it.

4548
03:07:07,270 --> 03:07:08,290
Yeah, they did.

4549
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:14,230
Luna gave me snowflake.

4550
03:07:14,930 --> 03:07:16,150
That's so true.

4551
03:07:17,750 --> 03:07:19,170
Did she even use it on anyone?

4552
03:07:19,450 --> 03:07:19,770
No.

4553
03:07:20,090 --> 03:07:20,710
I don't know.

4554
03:07:24,430 --> 03:07:25,870
I don't know.

4555
03:07:26,050 --> 03:07:27,190
I just needed a snowflake.

4556
03:07:27,190 --> 03:07:30,430
Because Ironman is really difficult to heal in general.

4557
03:07:30,910 --> 03:07:33,170
And that's why you always give your Ironman the snowflake.

4558
03:07:33,570 --> 03:07:36,390
So you don't have to worry about healing.

4559
03:07:36,970 --> 03:07:39,750
I'm trying not to do crazy movement and stuff.

4560
03:07:39,870 --> 03:07:41,150
Because I don't have a snowflake.

4561
03:07:41,310 --> 03:07:44,030
Because our Luna can't heal me.

4562
03:07:46,990 --> 03:07:48,930
Maybe they're doing something while playing.

4563
03:07:49,230 --> 03:07:49,890
Yeah, maybe.

4564
03:07:53,030 --> 03:07:53,510
Luna...

4565
03:07:53,510 --> 03:07:56,890
I would really like a snowflake.

4566
03:07:57,010 --> 03:07:59,010
But that's okay if you don't want...

4567
03:07:59,010 --> 03:08:01,530
That's okay if you don't want to...

4568
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:02,450
Oh wait, they play...

4569
03:08:02,450 --> 03:08:05,010
Wait, can you play Luna?

4570
03:08:05,230 --> 03:08:06,150
Or are you too laggy?

4571
03:08:07,250 --> 03:08:07,530
Me?

4572
03:08:07,710 --> 03:08:07,890
Oh.

4573
03:08:09,910 --> 03:08:11,350
Maybe they're too laggy.

4574
03:08:11,430 --> 03:08:12,510
Swap to Cloak and I'll swap.

4575
03:08:13,190 --> 03:08:15,330
Oh, I think...

4576
03:08:15,330 --> 03:08:16,090
Oh, never mind.

4577
03:08:16,410 --> 03:08:17,270
You didn't play Cloak.

4578
03:08:17,450 --> 03:08:20,170
We're not playing Hulk anymore.

4579
03:08:24,350 --> 03:08:25,150
That's alright.

4580
03:08:25,850 --> 03:08:26,490
I think they're...

4581
03:08:26,490 --> 03:08:28,790
I think they're duo'd with the Hulk.

4582
03:08:28,890 --> 03:08:30,330
And they were giving snowflake to the Hulk.

4583
03:08:30,590 --> 03:08:32,110
Which is a little crazy.

4584
03:08:32,270 --> 03:08:34,670
Which is dumb.

4585
03:08:34,790 --> 03:08:36,190
Because you can literally farm.

4586
03:08:41,600 --> 03:08:42,080
Okay.

4587
03:08:44,940 --> 03:08:45,420
Okay.

4588
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:46,600
Hawkeye.

4589
03:08:51,860 --> 03:08:52,560
There he is.

4590
03:08:52,580 --> 03:08:54,740
Yeah, their Hawkeye wasn't really doing that much last round.

4591
03:08:54,740 --> 03:08:56,320
He didn't really die either.

4592
03:08:56,460 --> 03:08:57,480
They were keeping him up.

4593
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:02,220
That's fine.

4594
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:06,900
I wonder if they'll ever change that.

4595
03:09:06,980 --> 03:09:08,600
Because she's so easy to kill.

4596
03:09:08,960 --> 03:09:10,280
Yeah, she is.

4597
03:09:12,240 --> 03:09:13,060
Oh, they're portaling.

4598
03:09:14,620 --> 03:09:15,720
That should be easy.

4599
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:18,200
Oh, I was going to be like...

4600
03:09:18,200 --> 03:09:19,420
That should be predictable, right?

4601
03:09:21,380 --> 03:09:22,780
I didn't even hear it.

4602
03:09:22,780 --> 03:09:24,920
Oh, the portal was like...

4603
03:09:24,920 --> 03:09:26,300
Oh, they double support ulted.

4604
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:26,940
Oh, okay.

4605
03:09:27,680 --> 03:09:28,480
That sucks.

4606
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:29,140
I should've...

4607
03:09:29,140 --> 03:09:31,660
I mean, they used both support ults.

4608
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:32,200
That's fine.

4609
03:09:32,300 --> 03:09:33,040
That's a good trade.

4610
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:36,360
I didn't think they were going to use two support ults.

4611
03:09:40,520 --> 03:09:41,660
Oh my god.

4612
03:09:42,520 --> 03:09:44,780
I triggered the cloak ult, so...

4613
03:09:44,780 --> 03:09:46,160
She didn't have to.

4614
03:09:48,340 --> 03:09:50,240
I still have...

4615
03:09:57,570 --> 03:09:59,070
I can follow the scarlet.

4616
03:10:00,270 --> 03:10:01,930
Oh, she's going to use her second.

4617
03:10:02,510 --> 03:10:03,050
Oh, alright.

4618
03:10:03,130 --> 03:10:03,710
They're not healed.

4619
03:10:04,690 --> 03:10:05,090
Oh, wait.

4620
03:10:06,010 --> 03:10:07,030
Oh, wait, wait.

4621
03:10:07,270 --> 03:10:08,190
Ult on the point.

4622
03:10:08,250 --> 03:10:11,590
Oh, it's on the...

4623
03:10:11,590 --> 03:10:11,850
Okay.

4624
03:10:12,170 --> 03:10:13,130
I couldn't see it.

4625
03:10:14,150 --> 03:10:15,690
There's so many colors.

4626
03:10:16,390 --> 03:10:17,810
There's so many things.

4627
03:10:18,930 --> 03:10:19,990
I was like, wait, where is it?

4628
03:10:21,490 --> 03:10:24,150
I'm going to farm you.

4629
03:10:24,150 --> 03:10:24,810
Bro.

4630
03:10:25,250 --> 03:10:26,370
I need ult.

4631
03:10:28,650 --> 03:10:29,490
It's fine.

4632
03:10:29,570 --> 03:10:31,370
Alright, this is okay.

4633
03:10:32,430 --> 03:10:33,130
This is okay.

4634
03:10:34,150 --> 03:10:36,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4635
03:10:36,690 --> 03:10:39,910
And they're not going to fuck up the strange ult, too.

4636
03:10:43,830 --> 03:10:44,430
There you go.

4637
03:10:45,210 --> 03:10:47,250
I don't know why you egoed me.

4638
03:10:47,430 --> 03:10:47,950
Heal me real quick.

4639
03:10:48,450 --> 03:10:48,870
Thank you.

4640
03:10:56,190 --> 03:10:58,270
Okay, I got ult from him.

4641
03:11:00,630 --> 03:11:01,890
I'm going to have Luna ult, though.

4642
03:11:04,690 --> 03:11:05,130
What?

4643
03:11:05,370 --> 03:11:05,970
Wait, where?

4644
03:11:06,150 --> 03:11:07,290
Oh, I didn't see Hawkeye.

4645
03:11:08,010 --> 03:11:09,590
He's literally behind us.

4646
03:11:09,770 --> 03:11:10,810
Yeah, I didn't see him.

4647
03:11:10,830 --> 03:11:11,390
Excuse me?

4648
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:16,570
Yeah, I didn't see him.

4649
03:11:16,710 --> 03:11:17,750
I was like, wait a minute.

4650
03:11:17,910 --> 03:11:18,190
What?

4651
03:11:18,670 --> 03:11:19,750
What's going on?

4652
03:11:20,330 --> 03:11:21,590
Okay, no, no, no.

4653
03:11:21,630 --> 03:11:22,710
Come on, no, no, no.

4654
03:11:22,750 --> 03:11:23,750
Don't leave the point.

4655
03:11:24,690 --> 03:11:26,710
Strange, why you leave the point, Strange?

4656
03:11:26,810 --> 03:11:28,090
Now you're dead!

4657
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:29,670
Okay.

4658
03:11:31,250 --> 03:11:32,850
Alright, I'll chill here then.

4659
03:11:33,270 --> 03:11:35,410
I have a little hidey hole right here.

4660
03:11:39,030 --> 03:11:40,110
Oh my god.

4661
03:11:41,890 --> 03:11:43,910
Bro, this guy really wants to ego.

4662
03:11:44,210 --> 03:11:44,990
Holy shit.

4663
03:11:46,630 --> 03:11:47,070
He's low.

4664
03:11:47,170 --> 03:11:47,430
He's low.

4665
03:11:47,490 --> 03:11:47,790
I got it.

4666
03:11:48,130 --> 03:11:48,370
Okay.

4667
03:11:48,370 --> 03:11:50,010
We pushed in with that.

4668
03:11:55,800 --> 03:11:56,340
What?

4669
03:11:56,880 --> 03:11:59,080
Okay, I triggered the cloak ult.

4670
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:00,260
I'm waiting.

4671
03:12:00,320 --> 03:12:01,740
I'm waiting for ults to be over.

4672
03:12:02,420 --> 03:12:02,560
Okay.

4673
03:12:05,080 --> 03:12:06,160
Oh no.

4674
03:12:07,280 --> 03:12:07,880
Wait, what?

4675
03:12:07,960 --> 03:12:08,820
Did he follow me?

4676
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:11,620
What's wrong with you?

4677
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:15,400
Hey, I'm going to solo ult you.

4678
03:12:17,440 --> 03:12:18,160
Oh no.

4679
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:19,420
Oh.

4680
03:12:21,020 --> 03:12:21,660
That's fine.

4681
03:12:21,980 --> 03:12:23,440
I'm dead though, but it's fine.

4682
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:24,980
I got three people on me.

4683
03:12:26,140 --> 03:12:27,140
We got three ults.

4684
03:12:28,480 --> 03:12:29,380
Oh my god.

4685
03:12:31,480 --> 03:12:32,400
Oh, that's a huge ult.

4686
03:12:32,460 --> 03:12:33,000
That's a huge ult.

4687
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:36,300
Oh, we got the point too.

4688
03:12:37,340 --> 03:12:38,540
Wait, there's only two of you?

4689
03:12:38,620 --> 03:12:38,940
What happened?

4690
03:12:40,360 --> 03:12:41,520
Wait, just play on your ult.

4691
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:42,400
I'm coming back.

4692
03:12:42,480 --> 03:12:42,780
Play on your ult.

4693
03:12:42,900 --> 03:12:45,300
Just go on point.

4694
03:12:45,300 --> 03:12:46,780
You can't die in it yet.

4695
03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:48,200
And I'm coming over too.

4696
03:12:51,120 --> 03:12:52,340
Oh, they ulted.

4697
03:12:52,720 --> 03:12:53,560
Yeah, but that's our ult.

4698
03:12:54,380 --> 03:12:55,580
I can kill the Luna.

4699
03:12:56,360 --> 03:12:57,700
I know I can kill Luna through it.

4700
03:12:58,000 --> 03:12:58,200
See?

4701
03:13:01,540 --> 03:13:02,300
Right here.

4702
03:13:02,520 --> 03:13:03,340
I'm backing up.

4703
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:04,200
That's fine.

4704
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:08,040
That's fine.

4705
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:10,220
See?

4706
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:10,940
Look at that.

4707
03:13:11,180 --> 03:13:11,780
We did it!

4708
03:13:12,680 --> 03:13:15,620
Yeah, that's why I said play on your ult because I know you can't die on your ult.

4709
03:13:16,560 --> 03:13:22,020
And then, Moon Knight ult, even the Luna ult, the Moon Knight ult can kill Luna if I shoot the Luna at the same time.

4710
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:23,400
Nice.

4711
03:13:24,600 --> 03:13:26,180
Yay, we did it!

4712
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:28,040
We did it!

4713
03:13:28,140 --> 03:13:29,940
That was too close, but we did it!

4714
03:13:30,460 --> 03:13:30,940
Yeah, that was close.

4715
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:31,480
Oh, nice!

4716
03:13:33,160 --> 03:13:33,520
Nice.

4717
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:36,080
Are you plat now?

4718
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:37,040
I don't know.

4719
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:37,260
No.

4720
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:38,760
I need one more unit.

4721
03:13:38,820 --> 03:13:39,220
Are you plat?

4722
03:13:39,220 --> 03:13:39,920
Yeah.

4723
03:13:39,960 --> 03:13:40,600
Yeah!

4724
03:13:42,200 --> 03:13:43,480
We did it!

4725
03:13:45,160 --> 03:13:46,820
Doobie's plat now!

4726
03:13:47,440 --> 03:13:48,560
My ult account is plat.

4727
03:13:48,620 --> 03:13:50,000
My regular account is already plat.

4728
03:13:50,500 --> 03:13:53,720
Now your main and regular account is plat now.

4729
03:13:55,320 --> 03:13:55,960
Yippee!

4730
03:13:57,700 --> 03:13:58,580
That was fun.

4731
03:13:59,160 --> 03:13:59,960
Oh my god.

4732
03:14:00,900 --> 03:14:01,920
That was really fun.

4733
03:14:02,260 --> 03:14:03,060
I know like...

4734
03:14:03,060 --> 03:14:03,560
Oh my god.

4735
03:14:03,720 --> 03:14:12,720
Chat, if you guys didn't know, Doobie, we went to play together a while back, but then I got incredibly Marvel Rivals killed.

4736
03:14:13,060 --> 03:14:14,500
You had your own arc.

4737
03:14:15,100 --> 03:14:16,880
Yeah, I went into a rake.

4738
03:14:17,340 --> 03:14:27,000
We were supposed to play I think the first week or something and then I just got fucking Marvel Rivals killed into a rake and I didn't come out.

4739
03:14:29,120 --> 03:14:30,660
You fell into the pit.

4740
03:14:30,900 --> 03:14:35,260
I fell into the pit and Doobie was outside the hole looking down at me.

4741
03:14:35,260 --> 03:14:36,180
Yeah, pretty much.

4742
03:14:40,320 --> 03:14:45,380
Well, I know it's also your thing to play competitively, like super competitively.

4743
03:14:45,620 --> 03:14:49,260
But for me, I was just like playing for fun, like playing every now and then.

4744
03:14:49,300 --> 03:14:51,260
I was like, oh god damn, she's all the way up there.

4745
03:14:55,280 --> 03:14:59,420
I remember I messaged you and I'm like, oh yeah, I'm like gold one now.

4746
03:14:59,660 --> 03:15:01,860
Yay, if you want to play, just hit me up.

4747
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:04,400
Yeah, and then I was like, oh, I'm GM.

4748
03:15:05,920 --> 03:15:12,680
A week later, like, hey, actually, I'm one of them all now.

4749
03:15:14,320 --> 03:15:17,620
No, it is really cool though, especially because you get to do so many tournaments and stuff.

4750
03:15:17,680 --> 03:15:18,980
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

4751
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:22,160
I think that's the fun part, but there's a lot of content creator tournaments.

4752
03:15:22,260 --> 03:15:24,200
Have you ever been interested in doing tournaments?

4753
03:15:24,880 --> 03:15:26,180
Just more so like casual.

4754
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:27,600
Not really.

4755
03:15:27,720 --> 03:15:29,880
I mean, I just play with friends pretty much.

4756
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:32,920
Yeah, tournament-wise, it's like a lot stressful too.

4757
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:34,260
Like, there's so much.

4758
03:15:34,540 --> 03:15:37,780
It's not like, you know, one mistake can cost it and stuff like that.

4759
03:15:37,980 --> 03:15:38,320
Yeah.

4760
03:15:38,760 --> 03:15:40,120
Yeah, so I can understand.

4761
03:15:40,140 --> 03:15:42,360
It's fun to practice and scrim.

4762
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:43,600
Scrims are fun.

4763
03:15:44,020 --> 03:15:44,940
Come up with comps and stuff.

4764
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:56,920
Yeah, I think like scrim-wise, it's like really fun, especially like, I think the tournament itself is super stressful, but when you're scrimming and everything is super organized and you don't have randoms you want to fucking kick, like...

4765
03:16:00,400 --> 03:16:02,900
Did you participate in the last official tournament?

4766
03:16:02,900 --> 03:16:03,020
No.

4767
03:16:04,580 --> 03:16:05,740
Oh yeah, you were busy.

4768
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:07,820
Yeah, I was really busy then.

4769
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:09,680
And I heard it's like...

4770
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:12,700
It was like... I think it was like 10 games, right?

4771
03:16:12,780 --> 03:16:13,620
Like 10 games.

4772
03:16:14,020 --> 03:16:16,400
Yeah, for the first qualifier, it was 10 games.

4773
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:20,500
Yeah, and it's like spanning between like 2-3 months and stuff like that.

4774
03:16:20,960 --> 03:16:21,500
Oh, yeah.

4775
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:24,380
The first one wasn't like... Maybe it was actually.

4776
03:16:24,980 --> 03:16:26,060
I didn't get that far, so...

4777
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:35,140
No, like my friends who are pros and Marble Rivals, like, they basically... Oh my God, like they're like, oh, you could totally be pro if you actually commit.

4778
03:16:35,260 --> 03:16:35,940
I was like, no.

4779
03:16:37,440 --> 03:16:38,740
This is their schedule.

4780
03:16:39,060 --> 03:16:45,580
They like wake up, because I'm PST, so they wake up and then 11am they have to do VOD review for an hour.

4781
03:16:46,200 --> 03:16:49,240
And this is every day, by the way, guys, this is every day for Marble Rivals.

4782
03:16:49,460 --> 03:16:58,500
They wake up at 11am, VOD review, 12pm to 2pm, first block of scrims, and then one hour VOD review after, and then...

4783
03:17:00,580 --> 03:17:07,700
three to six, another scrim block, and then VOD review, and then rank.

4784
03:17:08,480 --> 03:17:13,940
And they do this every day, and Sunday is their only rest day throughout all of that.

4785
03:17:15,340 --> 03:17:16,720
How can they do this?

4786
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:18,880
It's just passion.

4787
03:17:19,180 --> 03:17:20,620
Most people have jobs and stuff.

4788
03:17:21,360 --> 03:17:26,880
They're like paid to be a pro player, but even then, I don't think they're paid enough to do all of that.

4789
03:17:30,960 --> 03:17:32,400
They're like, why don't you try?

4790
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:34,660
And I was like, because I make more money doing this.

4791
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:43,840
I can literally just talk about random shit, and there's more money per hour.

4792
03:17:47,340 --> 03:17:50,960
And I was just like, Sunday's your only rest day?

4793
03:17:50,960 --> 03:17:53,200
And they're like, yep, Sunday's my only rest day.

4794
03:17:53,240 --> 03:17:54,600
I'm like, holy fuck.

4795
03:17:56,140 --> 03:18:00,300
Yeah, I feel like you get burned out so easily in the game.

4796
03:18:00,660 --> 03:18:08,040
That's why some of them don't even play rank, because it's just like, you know, rank right after scrims and stuff like that.

4797
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:10,440
It's more stressful.

4798
03:18:10,820 --> 03:18:21,800
I know in Apex pro scene, there's some teams where it's mandatory for them to play at least four plus hours of rank after practices, too.

4799
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:22,940
I know!

4800
03:18:23,100 --> 03:18:24,100
I was like, what?

4801
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:26,160
That sounds crazy!

4802
03:18:28,240 --> 03:18:30,120
No, I wouldn't be able to do that.

4803
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:34,840
Yeah, I was like, bro, I want to fucking, after stream, I just want to relax.

4804
03:18:36,920 --> 03:18:42,300
You could stream it as content, but then also if you do the same thing too much, people get tired of it.

4805
03:18:42,440 --> 03:18:45,880
Especially the same game, you stream the same game over and over again.

4806
03:18:45,900 --> 03:18:48,660
I don't know how people could do that every day.

4807
03:18:48,940 --> 03:18:52,960
That's why sometimes I like variety, so I can chill with that too.

4808
03:18:53,860 --> 03:18:58,980
You do a lot of unique stuff for your streams too, with your 3D and stuff.

4809
03:18:59,300 --> 03:19:01,360
I feel like you could play around so much with 3D.

4810
03:19:02,280 --> 03:19:02,700
Sometimes.

4811
03:19:03,020 --> 03:19:06,640
I haven't the past month because I messed up my studio a little bit.

4812
03:19:06,820 --> 03:19:07,960
Wait, what happened?

4813
03:19:08,880 --> 03:19:15,680
It's because preparing for the concert and stuff, I moved some things around to make it easier to do dancing.

4814
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:23,740
I just haven't moved it back into place, so it's not ready for streaming type of content right now, but I'm gonna do it.

4815
03:19:23,820 --> 03:19:25,100
We'll do it, guys.

4816
03:19:25,300 --> 03:19:25,760
Tomorrow.

4817
03:19:26,300 --> 03:19:27,080
We'll totally do it.

4818
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:30,780
We VTubers do not procrastinate.

4819
03:19:31,580 --> 03:19:36,240
I had so many cardboard boxes I had to get rid of, so I went to do recycling.

4820
03:19:38,300 --> 03:19:39,160
That's crazy.

4821
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:42,560
Yeah, that's like...

4822
03:19:43,200 --> 03:19:47,960
I remember seeing your dancing and said the worm was crazy.

4823
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:52,660
I told you, I told you.

4824
03:19:53,380 --> 03:19:54,760
I was gonna do it.

4825
03:19:55,280 --> 03:19:56,340
She did it.

4826
03:19:56,580 --> 03:19:57,820
She did the worm.

4827
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:03,140
It felt like you guys hyped me up, though.

4828
03:20:03,360 --> 03:20:05,700
It was like the epic jump and I was like, yeah.

4829
03:20:06,860 --> 03:20:13,240
I was worried maybe it looked like you guys were stepping on my hand or something, but it turned out fine.

4830
03:20:14,700 --> 03:20:16,120
That's the worst pain.

4831
03:20:16,280 --> 03:20:17,860
Have you had your hand stepped on before?

4832
03:20:17,980 --> 03:20:19,720
Oh, yeah, like the full body weight.

4833
03:20:20,560 --> 03:20:21,640
It's not good.

4834
03:20:23,740 --> 03:20:24,900
Thankfully, it didn't happen, though.

4835
03:20:25,280 --> 03:20:28,180
I know some people actually broke their hands, too.

4836
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:52,100
I knew a kid when I was younger, it was like all the neighborhood kids got on a shopping cart and the kid who was on the bottom, the rack where you put heavy stuff, we were going down a hill and his pinky got caught under the wheel and he had to go to the emergency room because it pretty much came off.

4837
03:20:52,300 --> 03:20:53,780
Oh my god!

4838
03:20:53,960 --> 03:20:54,720
That's crazy.

4839
03:20:55,460 --> 03:21:03,480
I heard that you can reattach any body part unless you have the body part.

4840
03:21:03,680 --> 03:21:04,600
Well, not your head, obviously.

4841
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:06,420
Oh, well, yeah.

4842
03:21:06,460 --> 03:21:08,000
But your limbs and stuff.

4843
03:21:08,300 --> 03:21:12,400
You can reattach any of your limbs as long as you still have the body part.

4844
03:21:13,020 --> 03:21:14,280
Yeah, it's kept intact.

4845
03:21:14,340 --> 03:21:18,160
And then they reattach the nerves and everything and you can use it.

4846
03:21:18,180 --> 03:21:20,180
It has to be within under 24 hours, though.

4847
03:21:20,980 --> 03:21:22,440
Oh, yeah.

4848
03:21:22,480 --> 03:21:23,200
Or else it dies.

4849
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:26,260
The nerves and stuff, you just can't.

4850
03:21:26,320 --> 03:21:28,480
You'll still be able to move, too, with it and shit.

4851
03:21:29,760 --> 03:21:32,980
So, I like how some people say, wait, then Winter Soldier can be real.

4852
03:21:36,540 --> 03:21:37,760
Wait, wait, what do you mean?

4853
03:21:37,880 --> 03:21:39,340
Is it his lore or something?

4854
03:21:39,500 --> 03:21:43,580
His arm is like a mechanic arm.

4855
03:21:44,400 --> 03:21:45,140
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4856
03:21:46,220 --> 03:21:47,300
It's possible, yeah.

4857
03:21:48,260 --> 03:21:49,600
Oh, wait, apparently you're frozen.

4858
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:50,540
Oh, you are frozen.

4859
03:21:51,400 --> 03:21:51,900
What, really?

4860
03:21:52,100 --> 03:21:54,740
Oh, I think I minimized by accident.

4861
03:21:55,680 --> 03:21:56,960
You're just looking up.

4862
03:21:59,100 --> 03:22:00,400
Oh, wait, I see what it is.

4863
03:22:00,880 --> 03:22:01,640
There we go.

4864
03:22:02,220 --> 03:22:03,140
Did that fix it?

4865
03:22:03,420 --> 03:22:04,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4866
03:22:04,200 --> 03:22:04,840
It fixed it.

4867
03:22:04,920 --> 03:22:05,960
I didn't even know when you were frozen.

4868
03:22:06,820 --> 03:22:09,280
No, it just happened because all my windows got minimized.

4869
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:14,480
Are you planning on getting GM, Juby?

4870
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:17,340
Probably not.

4871
03:22:17,800 --> 03:22:18,440
Why not?

4872
03:22:18,480 --> 03:22:19,740
You were so close last time.

4873
03:22:19,840 --> 03:22:22,380
It takes so much time, I think.

4874
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:22,880
What do you mean?

4875
03:22:22,940 --> 03:22:23,800
We got you to play.

4876
03:22:25,780 --> 03:22:26,180
Maybe.

4877
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:28,920
I'll play it like every other day.

4878
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:32,240
I believe in the Juby GM.

4879
03:22:32,720 --> 03:22:33,740
I believe in it.

4880
03:22:34,060 --> 03:22:35,600
You almost got to there.

4881
03:22:35,880 --> 03:22:36,920
It was so close.

4882
03:22:37,380 --> 03:22:40,820
I was like halfway to the bar thingy.

4883
03:22:42,520 --> 03:22:44,700
Hold on, sorry, I'm multitasking so my brain...

4884
03:22:46,260 --> 03:22:50,480
I just realized that on my stream, you're kind of see-through.

4885
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:51,320
Oh, am I?

4886
03:22:52,340 --> 03:22:54,700
Yeah, it's because I messed with the Chrome.

4887
03:22:54,920 --> 03:22:56,360
Oh, you messed with the Chrome.

4888
03:22:57,260 --> 03:22:58,560
Oh, there it goes.

4889
03:22:58,660 --> 03:22:58,800
Okay.

4890
03:22:59,800 --> 03:23:01,580
Even though we're almost done.

4891
03:23:01,800 --> 03:23:02,760
We fixed it.

4892
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:06,300
It's because you were smaller before, so you couldn't really tell.

4893
03:23:08,240 --> 03:23:09,440
It's okay, guys.

4894
03:23:09,520 --> 03:23:10,620
We fixed it now.

4895
03:23:11,460 --> 03:23:14,840
I have the same problem with mine because I have pink and green.

4896
03:23:14,940 --> 03:23:15,660
That's so true.

4897
03:23:15,840 --> 03:23:16,560
It's hard to find a color.

4898
03:23:17,460 --> 03:23:18,620
Because of the green screen.

4899
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:21,500
And I have a red eye, so I couldn't do red, so I was like...

4900
03:23:21,500 --> 03:23:24,300
I showed really bright purple or something.

4901
03:23:25,720 --> 03:23:27,520
It's just your pin disappears a little bit.

4902
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:29,100
Because it's kind of purple.

4903
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:29,840
Oh, that's true.

4904
03:23:29,920 --> 03:23:30,480
That's not right.

4905
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:32,460
It's really dark.

4906
03:23:34,420 --> 03:23:35,700
It's not that important.

4907
03:23:36,100 --> 03:23:36,920
Oh, my God.

4908
03:23:37,060 --> 03:23:38,140
You should introduce me.

4909
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:42,260
Some of my chat got a great idea, but you should show me some of the Roblox games you play.

4910
03:23:43,120 --> 03:23:45,120
Okay, well, I only play two, but...

4911
03:23:45,560 --> 03:23:47,360
I'll show you the squid game one.

4912
03:23:48,360 --> 03:23:49,860
It's called Takeoff.

4913
03:23:50,380 --> 03:23:51,380
I'll send a picture.

4914
03:23:51,980 --> 03:23:52,700
Oh, yeah.

4915
03:23:52,820 --> 03:23:55,380
I forgot I was going to send you the... Wait, let me send you the...

4916
03:23:56,560 --> 03:23:59,380
the video of the Wolverine.

4917
03:23:59,400 --> 03:24:00,320
I need you to...

4918
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:03,000
Is it like, there's two wolves inside of me?

4919
03:24:03,360 --> 03:24:05,240
Yeah, it's like, you know the song Animals?

4920
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:07,000
Oh, yeah.

4921
03:24:07,140 --> 03:24:08,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4922
03:24:08,240 --> 03:24:08,960
Okay, give me a sec.

4923
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:09,640
Let me find it.

4924
03:24:09,820 --> 03:24:11,260
Or my mod can find it.

4925
03:24:11,640 --> 03:24:13,520
Because I don't know.

4926
03:24:13,880 --> 03:24:15,520
It's been a while, guys.

4927
03:24:15,620 --> 03:24:16,980
Since I looked at that video.

4928
03:24:17,380 --> 03:24:18,340
It's a great video.

4929
03:24:18,340 --> 03:24:19,060
Pull up the clip.

4930
03:24:20,680 --> 03:24:21,400
It's like...

4931
03:24:21,400 --> 03:24:23,580
Oh, my God.

4932
03:24:23,640 --> 03:24:24,920
I need to find that video.

4933
03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:25,520
Oh, my God.

4934
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:26,260
It's so difficult.

4935
03:24:27,020 --> 03:24:28,340
I've been like...

4936
03:24:29,300 --> 03:24:31,960
I think I sent it to like five people already.

4937
03:24:32,500 --> 03:24:35,360
Because it's just... I'll be like, have you seen this clip?

4938
03:24:35,380 --> 03:24:35,880
And they're like, no.

4939
03:24:35,940 --> 03:24:38,280
I was like, you have to see it.

4940
03:24:38,720 --> 03:24:41,680
It's like, stop everything and just watch this video.

4941
03:24:42,200 --> 03:24:43,720
Well, what do you use to find memes?

4942
03:24:43,820 --> 03:24:44,960
Because I know some people just use Twitter.

4943
03:24:45,340 --> 03:24:47,080
I just use Twitter or Instagram.

4944
03:24:47,480 --> 03:24:48,980
Yeah, it's this one.

4945
03:24:49,280 --> 03:24:50,560
I'll show it to my chat, too.

4946
03:24:51,240 --> 03:24:54,180
It's actually one of my favorite Marvel Rival memes.

4947
03:24:54,900 --> 03:24:57,600
You know how the Twitter's algorithm and stuff?

4948
03:24:58,300 --> 03:25:00,160
People were like, oh, man.

4949
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:02,500
Oh, this VTuber drama.

4950
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:03,420
All that shit.

4951
03:25:03,660 --> 03:25:06,160
All this other drama and stuff.

4952
03:25:06,320 --> 03:25:09,380
And then my Twitter algorithm is really just Marvel Rival memes.

4953
03:25:11,460 --> 03:25:14,080
It's Marvel Rival memes and artwork.

4954
03:25:14,680 --> 03:25:15,080
Like...

4955
03:25:16,380 --> 03:25:17,500
It's better that way.

4956
03:25:17,740 --> 03:25:19,920
Yeah, that's all it is.

4957
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:20,880
They're like, oh, man.

4958
03:25:22,320 --> 03:25:23,500
Yeah, the awoooo.

4959
03:25:23,940 --> 03:25:24,340
Awoooo.

4960
03:25:26,220 --> 03:25:29,520
I fucking love that meme.

4961
03:25:30,120 --> 03:25:34,500
It's one of my... and then I love it when all the Wolverine players are going to be like, awoooo.

4962
03:25:36,620 --> 03:25:37,020
Awoooo.

4963
03:25:37,020 --> 03:25:41,920
Honestly, I was surprised that I like Marvel Rivals as much as I did or anybody liked it as much as they do.

4964
03:25:41,920 --> 03:25:45,160
And also, it makes me feel like I like the Marvel characters more.

4965
03:25:45,340 --> 03:25:49,920
Like, I'm actually influenced to be more interested in them and their lore and stuff.

4966
03:25:50,420 --> 03:25:54,300
And then, like, because you already know the characters before you play.

4967
03:25:54,400 --> 03:25:58,720
Like, overwatch, you have to learn the characters from the interaction stuff while you're playing.

4968
03:25:58,840 --> 03:26:03,100
But, like, Marvel Rivals, you already know there's so many other spin-off shows and stuff like that, too.

4969
03:26:03,340 --> 03:26:05,700
And I think the skins are a lot better, too.

4970
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:06,280
I think.

4971
03:26:06,980 --> 03:26:08,080
Oh, better than Overwatch?

4972
03:26:08,380 --> 03:26:13,940
Yeah, there's more relatability for the skins cause you're like, oh, it's from that comic, or it's from that movie.

4973
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:15,160
Yeah.

4974
03:26:15,420 --> 03:26:21,660
Well, I mean having a huge franchise is kind of like, well, I mean, of course you can fail, but I feel like it's harder to beat you DC.

4975
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:22,520
Yeah, yeah, it's harder.

4976
03:26:24,440 --> 03:26:24,840
Hahaha!

4977
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:26,740
DC hasn't figured it out.

4978
03:26:27,140 --> 03:26:27,680
It hasn't.

4979
03:26:27,880 --> 03:26:30,880
Honestly, like, the Commando show is really good.

4980
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:31,360
It's fine.

4981
03:26:31,420 --> 03:26:35,600
But other than that, I haven't been interested much with a lot of the DC...

4982
03:26:35,600 --> 03:26:39,960
I think, like, DC animated movies are really, really I love DC animated movies.

4983
03:26:40,180 --> 03:26:41,260
I haven't seen them.

4984
03:26:41,460 --> 03:26:46,300
I was gonna say maybe DC, they could make an animated, or sorry, a MOBA game.

4985
03:26:46,680 --> 03:26:48,140
Oh, that's true!

4986
03:26:48,340 --> 03:26:49,700
Like Pokemon Unite.

4987
03:26:50,440 --> 03:26:51,940
Pokemon Unite was pretty good.

4988
03:26:52,260 --> 03:26:52,800
Yeah, I agree.

4989
03:26:54,400 --> 03:26:55,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4990
03:26:55,220 --> 03:26:58,060
I think Pokemon Unite was pretty good.

4991
03:26:58,280 --> 03:27:02,020
And if they do some sort of MOBA for it, I think people would really enjoy it.

4992
03:27:02,280 --> 03:27:05,100
But like, um, for DC, yeah.

4993
03:27:05,100 --> 03:27:07,480
It would be funny if DC does a hero shooter too.

4994
03:27:08,160 --> 03:27:09,640
If they do a hero shooter.

4995
03:27:10,080 --> 03:27:10,940
I don't know.

4996
03:27:11,820 --> 03:27:12,280
I don't know.

4997
03:27:12,360 --> 03:27:13,300
I mean, they see the success.

4998
03:27:13,720 --> 03:27:17,100
Marvel Rivals made so much money on skins alone, I read.

4999
03:27:17,500 --> 03:27:18,600
From just the skins.

5000
03:27:18,640 --> 03:27:19,480
And battle pass and stuff.

5001
03:27:19,500 --> 03:27:20,660
Yeah, just the battle pass.

5002
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:24,720
I mean, it's really helpful with the fact that they're like, the battle passes don't expire.

5003
03:27:25,180 --> 03:27:28,600
So you can technically buy older battle passes if you want to.

5004
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:31,240
Oh, I didn't know that.

5005
03:27:31,240 --> 03:27:31,660
Yeah.

5006
03:27:32,380 --> 03:27:33,240
Like, I feel like...

5007
03:27:35,620 --> 03:27:37,280
I feel like they'll...

5008
03:27:37,280 --> 03:27:39,240
I don't know, I think that's such a good idea.

5009
03:27:39,360 --> 03:27:42,860
Because it means newer players can still give money for older battle passes.

5010
03:27:43,640 --> 03:27:45,320
Oh wait, DC already have a MOBA?

5011
03:27:45,460 --> 03:27:46,520
They have a MOBA?

5012
03:27:47,100 --> 03:27:48,460
What the hell?

5013
03:27:48,540 --> 03:27:49,540
I didn't know that.

5014
03:27:50,540 --> 03:27:51,580
I did not know that either.

5015
03:27:52,720 --> 03:27:53,600
DC MOBA.

5016
03:27:54,560 --> 03:27:55,940
Oh my god, they do.

5017
03:27:56,120 --> 03:27:57,080
When did it die?

5018
03:27:57,200 --> 03:27:58,900
It discontinued in 2015.

5019
03:27:58,900 --> 03:27:59,800
Oh!

5020
03:28:01,140 --> 03:28:03,320
Oh my god, that's 10 years ago!

5021
03:28:03,640 --> 03:28:05,100
Oh my god, it was called like...

5022
03:28:05,100 --> 03:28:06,000
That's crazy.

5023
03:28:06,220 --> 03:28:08,940
Infinite Crisis Battle Arena Video Game.

5024
03:28:09,060 --> 03:28:09,840
Wait, what?

5025
03:28:11,240 --> 03:28:12,620
Maybe it was too...

5026
03:28:12,620 --> 03:28:14,960
They were too...

5027
03:28:14,960 --> 03:28:16,260
Yeah, it was just...

5028
03:28:16,260 --> 03:28:18,280
They were too early, you know.

5029
03:28:18,680 --> 03:28:19,960
They were...

5030
03:28:19,960 --> 03:28:21,300
They should bring it back.

5031
03:28:21,420 --> 03:28:22,320
They should try it again.

5032
03:28:23,800 --> 03:28:24,780
Maybe people will be interested?

5033
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:25,700
Yeah.

5034
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:28,120
Maybe they'll die like...

5035
03:28:28,120 --> 03:28:30,400
I guess die like Heroes of the Storm, I guess.

5036
03:28:30,560 --> 03:28:32,000
Well, at least they still have the servers.

5037
03:28:32,260 --> 03:28:34,120
At least Heroes of the Storm servers are still up.

5038
03:28:34,140 --> 03:28:34,860
It's still going.

5039
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:37,100
It's still sort of going, yeah.

5040
03:28:37,880 --> 03:28:39,880
It's much more fun than League, trust me.

5041
03:28:40,160 --> 03:28:40,840
Wait, really?

5042
03:28:41,220 --> 03:28:43,920
You have to buy for your build and stuff.

5043
03:28:44,420 --> 03:28:46,460
Heroes of the Storm, you just upgrade your abilities.

5044
03:28:46,600 --> 03:28:47,600
You don't have to buy items.

5045
03:28:49,240 --> 03:28:50,120
Oh, like...

5046
03:28:50,120 --> 03:28:51,700
What makes it easier than League?

5047
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:53,880
Well, yeah, just that you don't have to buy items.

5048
03:28:53,960 --> 03:28:55,700
You just upgrade abilities and play like...

5049
03:28:56,420 --> 03:28:57,300
Oh, it's just...

5050
03:28:57,300 --> 03:28:59,720
So there's not like a million items to upgrade.

5051
03:28:59,860 --> 03:29:00,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5052
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:01,640
So it's just like...

5053
03:29:02,920 --> 03:29:04,520
It's like Deadlock, basically.

5054
03:29:04,840 --> 03:29:05,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5055
03:29:05,660 --> 03:29:06,640
It works really similar.

5056
03:29:06,680 --> 03:29:09,080
Except Deadlock does have items too, but...

5057
03:29:09,080 --> 03:29:10,680
Yeah, yeah, but like...

5058
03:29:11,960 --> 03:29:13,900
It's like upgrades and items.

5059
03:29:14,220 --> 03:29:14,760
But like...

5060
03:29:14,760 --> 03:29:16,340
So like...

5061
03:29:17,020 --> 03:29:17,920
It's the same thing.

5062
03:29:17,920 --> 03:29:19,920
But they just removed the items part.

5063
03:29:20,660 --> 03:29:21,700
Yeah, yeah.

5064
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:23,280
How do you think about Deadlock?

5065
03:29:23,500 --> 03:29:24,780
I'm not sure if you enjoyed it.

5066
03:29:24,840 --> 03:29:27,340
I haven't played it in like a few months, I think.

5067
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:29,200
It was pretty fun though.

5068
03:29:29,580 --> 03:29:34,120
I think like after Marvel Rivals came out, everyone just forgot about Deadlock.

5069
03:29:35,960 --> 03:29:39,840
The thing is with Deadlock, it takes so much more...

5070
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:44,000
You have to pay really close attention to make sure you're farming the souls and everything.

5071
03:29:44,200 --> 03:29:44,560
Yeah.

5072
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:45,940
That's true.

5073
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:47,640
The farming part is...

5074
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:49,020
I love the...

5075
03:29:49,820 --> 03:29:52,220
I love the...

5076
03:29:52,220 --> 03:29:53,500
The like...

5077
03:29:53,500 --> 03:29:55,000
The shooting for it.

5078
03:29:55,080 --> 03:29:57,540
The shooting mechanics and the fighting.

5079
03:29:57,900 --> 03:29:59,300
But oh my god.

5080
03:29:59,560 --> 03:30:01,800
When I have to do the fucking farming part.

5081
03:30:01,920 --> 03:30:03,860
The farming the creeps and like...

5082
03:30:03,860 --> 03:30:05,400
I just want to go crazy.

5083
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:06,200
I was like...

5084
03:30:06,200 --> 03:30:11,400
Like the 10 minutes of looking at each other and farming creeps is so...

5085
03:30:11,400 --> 03:30:12,560
I'm so bored.

5086
03:30:12,620 --> 03:30:14,260
Can we just shoot each other?

5087
03:30:16,680 --> 03:30:18,180
I think that's it too.

5088
03:30:18,260 --> 03:30:19,640
I get too impatient in that game.

5089
03:30:19,960 --> 03:30:20,440
Yeah, me too.

5090
03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:22,580
I end up not doing the stuff that I need to do.

5091
03:30:22,920 --> 03:30:24,920
Farming creeps because it's boring.

5092
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:26,760
Yeah, I feel that.

5093
03:30:26,820 --> 03:30:27,720
I feel that a lot.

5094
03:30:27,860 --> 03:30:28,680
I'm just like...

5095
03:30:28,680 --> 03:30:30,440
Please, I can't.

5096
03:30:30,540 --> 03:30:33,360
I can't shoot these guys again.

5097
03:30:35,100 --> 03:30:36,460
Just shoot me.

5098
03:30:36,760 --> 03:30:37,700
Just shoot me.

5099
03:30:38,540 --> 03:30:40,060
And then when you shoot them...

5100
03:30:40,060 --> 03:30:41,660
They're so busy farming creeps.

5101
03:30:41,660 --> 03:30:42,280
They run away.

5102
03:30:42,440 --> 03:30:43,140
And I'm like...

5103
03:30:43,140 --> 03:30:43,620
Fight me.

5104
03:30:44,660 --> 03:30:46,180
Why are you running away?

5105
03:30:47,660 --> 03:30:49,060
Just because you're not as far?

5106
03:30:50,980 --> 03:30:53,240
I feel like even more than Marvel Rivals.

5107
03:30:53,480 --> 03:30:56,660
I mean, I know Marvel Rivals are supposed to be having huge team fights.

5108
03:30:56,800 --> 03:30:59,180
But if you're doing a 3v3 on one side of the map.

5109
03:30:59,280 --> 03:30:59,960
That's fine.

5110
03:31:00,060 --> 03:31:02,620
But for Deadlock, you need the whole team there.

5111
03:31:02,640 --> 03:31:04,800
Yeah, you need the whole 6v6.

5112
03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:07,740
Or one person missing just fucks up everything.

5113
03:31:08,140 --> 03:31:09,760
It needs to be balanced.

5114
03:31:10,760 --> 03:31:12,420
On how many people are in the fight.

5115
03:31:12,740 --> 03:31:13,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5116
03:31:14,380 --> 03:31:16,980
They haven't actually launched yet for Deadlock.

5117
03:31:17,080 --> 03:31:17,800
So maybe they'll change.

5118
03:31:18,660 --> 03:31:20,180
Remember it was closed beta?

5119
03:31:20,280 --> 03:31:21,540
It was invite only.

5120
03:31:21,780 --> 03:31:23,960
So it's not actually launched yet to everybody.

5121
03:31:24,140 --> 03:31:25,640
But it was so easy to get an invite anyway.

5122
03:31:27,520 --> 03:31:29,440
I think it's open beta now.

5123
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:29,820
Well, yeah.

5124
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:31,080
It's been a while since it's been out.

5125
03:31:31,220 --> 03:31:32,000
For Alpha.

5126
03:31:32,000 --> 03:31:33,640
I think it's still beta.

5127
03:31:33,820 --> 03:31:35,140
But you still need an invite for it.

5128
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:38,300
You still need to have someone invite you to join the game.

5129
03:31:39,580 --> 03:31:40,900
It's not open yet.

5130
03:31:41,200 --> 03:31:43,160
So maybe...

5131
03:31:43,160 --> 03:31:47,240
I think Valve has to be afraid of Marvel Rivals.

5132
03:31:47,340 --> 03:31:49,320
Because before there was zero competition for them.

5133
03:31:50,100 --> 03:31:51,940
Yeah, it was open season.

5134
03:31:52,100 --> 03:31:54,660
People kind of forgot about hero shooters a little bit.

5135
03:31:55,540 --> 03:31:58,380
Because Overwatch is dead and there wasn't really anything else.

5136
03:31:58,380 --> 03:32:02,440
I honestly did not expect Marvel Rivals to pop up as much as it did.

5137
03:32:02,640 --> 03:32:05,160
Because I got invited since closed Alpha.

5138
03:32:07,060 --> 03:32:08,400
I've been playing since closed Alpha.

5139
03:32:08,700 --> 03:32:11,560
And people kept asking me like, Do you think this is going to be the next game?

5140
03:32:11,660 --> 03:32:13,300
And I'm like, I don't know.

5141
03:32:13,400 --> 03:32:14,000
It's third person.

5142
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:17,280
And I was playing it all the way till closed Alpha to beta.

5143
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:20,160
And I never got hooked.

5144
03:32:20,720 --> 03:32:22,480
But then rank opened.

5145
03:32:22,860 --> 03:32:24,100
And I was like, oh my.

5146
03:32:24,140 --> 03:32:25,120
I get it now.

5147
03:32:25,780 --> 03:32:29,000
I was like, I get it now.

5148
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:30,140
Oh my god.

5149
03:32:30,520 --> 03:32:32,100
I understand.

5150
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:36,720
For you, it's like the aspiration of getting to the top.

5151
03:32:36,840 --> 03:32:39,160
It's just the competitiveness.

5152
03:32:39,480 --> 03:32:40,140
It's always fun.

5153
03:32:40,420 --> 03:32:42,540
And then seeing yourself get higher and higher.

5154
03:32:43,060 --> 03:32:44,680
Just improving more and more.

5155
03:32:44,840 --> 03:32:48,160
That's my motivation for competitive.

5156
03:32:48,760 --> 03:32:50,420
I can't play quick play.

5157
03:32:50,640 --> 03:32:54,020
Legitimately, I would rather bash my head against the wall than play quick play.

5158
03:32:55,760 --> 03:32:56,960
That's fair.

5159
03:32:57,120 --> 03:32:58,680
You're just not doing anything.

5160
03:32:58,940 --> 03:33:00,140
There's no stakes.

5161
03:33:00,860 --> 03:33:02,900
There's no challenge.

5162
03:33:03,300 --> 03:33:06,200
There's no fear.

5163
03:33:08,220 --> 03:33:10,760
Have you ever played Counter Strike?

5164
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:12,940
No, I never played CS.

5165
03:33:13,480 --> 03:33:14,700
Or CSGO.

5166
03:33:14,900 --> 03:33:16,420
It's a tactical shooter.

5167
03:33:17,020 --> 03:33:19,180
I've always wanted to learn CS.

5168
03:33:19,460 --> 03:33:20,600
I've always wanted to.

5169
03:33:20,600 --> 03:33:22,160
But then, it felt like...

5170
03:33:23,140 --> 03:33:24,900
Especially grenade angles.

5171
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:25,440
Oh, callouts.

5172
03:33:25,640 --> 03:33:27,200
And callouts too.

5173
03:33:27,380 --> 03:33:29,420
I was playing with people for CS.

5174
03:33:30,420 --> 03:33:31,540
He's in...

5175
03:33:31,540 --> 03:33:33,200
Snake or some shit.

5176
03:33:33,360 --> 03:33:34,860
And I'm like, what the fuck is Snake?

5177
03:33:40,560 --> 03:33:41,680
They're under...

5178
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:44,540
These are some weird fucking callouts.

5179
03:33:45,940 --> 03:33:46,520
There it is.

5180
03:33:50,680 --> 03:33:54,380
Is there actually a place called Banana in CS?

5181
03:33:54,520 --> 03:33:54,800
Oh, yeah.

5182
03:33:54,920 --> 03:33:57,680
What the fuck is Banana?

5183
03:33:58,440 --> 03:33:59,740
It's shaped like a banana.

5184
03:33:59,920 --> 03:34:02,260
It's shaped like a banana.

5185
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:03,560
Yeah.

5186
03:34:04,720 --> 03:34:06,160
Yeah, I've always wanted...

5187
03:34:06,160 --> 03:34:06,900
You should try playing.

5188
03:34:07,060 --> 03:34:10,720
I could teach you the map callouts.

5189
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:11,460
Oh, yeah.

5190
03:34:12,060 --> 03:34:14,800
They have a game mode called Wingman where it's only two people.

5191
03:34:15,160 --> 03:34:16,480
And it's in parts of the map.

5192
03:34:16,660 --> 03:34:19,660
So you would be able to learn different parts pretty easily.

5193
03:34:19,660 --> 03:34:20,940
I'm down to learn.

5194
03:34:21,040 --> 03:34:22,780
I've always wanted to learn CS too.

5195
03:34:24,100 --> 03:34:26,280
You're just like, it's finally someone to play CS with.

5196
03:34:26,800 --> 03:34:27,000
Yeah.

5197
03:34:27,660 --> 03:34:29,140
I'm converting some people.

5198
03:34:29,440 --> 03:34:31,240
I got some friends to play.

5199
03:34:31,560 --> 03:34:32,580
Oh, thank you.

5200
03:34:32,860 --> 03:34:34,040
It's actually pretty decent.

5201
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:36,200
It's your turn to boost me.

5202
03:34:38,320 --> 03:34:41,500
I'm not really ranked highly in CS right now either.

5203
03:34:41,800 --> 03:34:43,600
I got pretty high.

5204
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:45,120
What's your highest rank?

5205
03:34:46,500 --> 03:34:47,020
MG2.

5206
03:34:47,020 --> 03:34:47,920
MG2?

5207
03:34:48,780 --> 03:34:50,580
That's something Guardian, right?

5208
03:34:51,080 --> 03:34:51,340
Yeah.

5209
03:34:52,960 --> 03:34:54,220
That's pretty high.

5210
03:34:54,700 --> 03:34:56,100
That's like the Eagle, right?

5211
03:34:56,520 --> 03:34:56,760
Yeah.

5212
03:34:58,180 --> 03:34:59,320
MGE is the Eagle.

5213
03:34:59,980 --> 03:35:01,040
That's why there's an E.

5214
03:35:01,540 --> 03:35:04,540
Oh, that's one rank.

5215
03:35:04,680 --> 03:35:06,040
You were almost at the Eagle.

5216
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:09,580
Yeah, but I wasn't there for very long.

5217
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:12,360
That's pretty high.

5218
03:35:12,360 --> 03:35:13,240
Yeah, that's pretty...

5219
03:35:14,100 --> 03:35:15,960
Wait, how much...

5220
03:35:15,960 --> 03:35:17,460
What's your skin total?

5221
03:35:18,780 --> 03:35:19,880
Actually, I don't know.

5222
03:35:20,100 --> 03:35:22,440
I do have a knife skin, but it's not very cool.

5223
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:23,980
It's just like a Safari mech.

5224
03:35:26,300 --> 03:35:29,460
Were you not opening cases and stuff for CS?

5225
03:35:29,580 --> 03:35:31,240
Yeah, but I never get anything.

5226
03:35:33,020 --> 03:35:36,060
I must have opened like 300 or 400 cases.

5227
03:35:36,480 --> 03:35:37,980
What the fuck?

5228
03:35:38,600 --> 03:35:39,520
How many?

5229
03:35:39,520 --> 03:35:41,800
The only thing I got was like an M4 skin.

5230
03:35:42,340 --> 03:35:43,800
Oh my god!

5231
03:35:44,020 --> 03:35:44,620
What?

5232
03:35:45,300 --> 03:35:52,760
I was saving... I saved up cases for maybe like 6 or 7 years and finally I opened a shit ton of...

5233
03:35:52,760 --> 03:35:54,120
There was no gacha luck there.

5234
03:35:54,600 --> 03:35:57,280
There was no gacha luck there.

5235
03:35:57,660 --> 03:35:58,740
That's crazy.

5236
03:36:00,420 --> 03:36:01,040
That's...

5237
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:02,060
Oh my god, did you...

5238
03:36:02,060 --> 03:36:04,980
I bought skins though off of the marketplace.

5239
03:36:05,320 --> 03:36:06,540
Now it looks cool.

5240
03:36:06,540 --> 03:36:09,060
Like knife skins or just gun skins?

5241
03:36:09,780 --> 03:36:10,820
Just skins that I like.

5242
03:36:10,940 --> 03:36:12,360
They're green colored.

5243
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:14,980
There's like glove skins.

5244
03:36:15,240 --> 03:36:16,720
Wait, there's skins for gloves now?

5245
03:36:16,900 --> 03:36:18,500
There's operator skins, yeah.

5246
03:36:18,780 --> 03:36:19,260
Oh.

5247
03:36:20,060 --> 03:36:21,280
I got operator skins.

5248
03:36:21,800 --> 03:36:23,540
Oh my gosh, your account must be worth a lot.

5249
03:36:24,700 --> 03:36:25,180
Maybe.

5250
03:36:26,060 --> 03:36:26,540
Maybe.

5251
03:36:27,080 --> 03:36:29,820
Maybe I should do one of those steam estimates.

5252
03:36:30,160 --> 03:36:34,340
Yeah, you should do a steam estimate just to see how much there are in total.

5253
03:36:35,740 --> 03:36:36,800
Wait, I could probably...

5254
03:36:36,800 --> 03:36:38,460
You just have to have your steam like public, right?

5255
03:36:38,580 --> 03:36:39,660
I don't know.

5256
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:41,140
Inventory?

5257
03:36:41,380 --> 03:36:43,020
As a person who doesn't play CS.

5258
03:36:43,900 --> 03:36:47,220
I was like, 99% of gamblers quit before they win.

5259
03:36:49,080 --> 03:36:50,020
Like, open for cases.

5260
03:36:50,020 --> 03:36:51,220
Yeah, but I ran out of cases.

5261
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:55,720
It's like be back to 2010 where you do like case openings in video.

5262
03:36:57,240 --> 03:37:04,380
I bought 100 CS cases and we're gonna open them now, live on stream.

5263
03:37:04,800 --> 03:37:05,120
Yeah.

5264
03:37:05,380 --> 03:37:06,980
For the whatever knife.

5265
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:08,340
It's still popular.

5266
03:37:09,520 --> 03:37:11,080
Yeah, yeah, you should totally...

5267
03:37:12,420 --> 03:37:15,340
Guys, if you donate, she'll do a case opening stream.

5268
03:37:15,460 --> 03:37:21,500
If you wanna buy $100 worth of cases, you're gonna spend like $800 or something.

5269
03:37:21,660 --> 03:37:22,360
It's $800?

5270
03:37:23,380 --> 03:37:24,680
For 100 cases?

5271
03:37:25,620 --> 03:37:27,500
People sell cases for...

5272
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:33,220
It depends on what case you buy, but some of them sell for like $4 or $8 or $7 and so on.

5273
03:37:34,440 --> 03:37:36,900
I don't think cases are that cheap right now either.

5274
03:37:37,620 --> 03:37:38,340
Alright, guys.

5275
03:37:38,640 --> 03:37:40,240
What do you call your fans, Doobie?

5276
03:37:41,320 --> 03:37:42,580
Oh, I don't have a name for them yet.

5277
03:37:43,020 --> 03:37:45,020
Alright, Dooberts.

5278
03:37:45,160 --> 03:37:46,600
You guys, it's $800.

5279
03:37:51,880 --> 03:37:55,660
Dooberts, it's $800 for 100 cases.

5280
03:37:55,840 --> 03:37:56,540
Here is that.

5281
03:37:57,740 --> 03:37:58,380
No, no.

5282
03:37:58,500 --> 03:38:00,440
Then I'll actually have to do it.

5283
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:01,420
I promise.

5284
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:05,200
Oh, no.

5285
03:38:05,460 --> 03:38:07,220
You have to open cases.

5286
03:38:07,560 --> 03:38:08,780
It's not worth it.

5287
03:38:08,820 --> 03:38:10,100
You don't get anything.

5288
03:38:10,780 --> 03:38:13,240
But what if you get a cool knife, Doobie?

5289
03:38:13,660 --> 03:38:14,860
I'd rather buy a knife.

5290
03:38:15,400 --> 03:38:17,140
You can get a really cool knife for $800.

5291
03:38:17,860 --> 03:38:18,780
But the thrill!

5292
03:38:19,500 --> 03:38:20,620
The thrill of opening...

5293
03:38:20,620 --> 03:38:24,340
I've experienced the thrill and I've been let down too many times.

5294
03:38:24,340 --> 03:38:27,840
But 99% of gamblers quit before they win.

5295
03:38:28,860 --> 03:38:31,280
You could be the 1%.

5296
03:38:32,420 --> 03:38:35,960
Actually, I do have some cases like on an old account.

5297
03:38:36,780 --> 03:38:38,440
Oh, you can like ship the...

5298
03:38:38,440 --> 03:38:42,640
Yeah, you can like... Can't you like send cases to...

5299
03:38:42,640 --> 03:38:43,280
Oh, no.

5300
03:38:45,260 --> 03:38:47,840
Oh, no.

5301
03:38:47,860 --> 03:38:50,200
Bring back 2010, Doobie.

5302
03:38:50,320 --> 03:38:51,480
Bring it back.

5303
03:38:51,480 --> 03:38:51,680
Bring it back.

5304
03:38:53,340 --> 03:38:55,480
No, people are still doing case openings.

5305
03:38:55,680 --> 03:38:57,180
It's not something from like...

5306
03:38:57,180 --> 03:38:58,140
How many years ago was that?

5307
03:38:58,280 --> 03:38:59,340
15 years ago?

5308
03:39:00,240 --> 03:39:04,980
Yeah, but then you can be the VTuber that does it, you know?

5309
03:39:05,720 --> 03:39:10,120
You can say that, but how many VTubers does a case opening stream?

5310
03:39:10,960 --> 03:39:11,680
There's like 1.

5311
03:39:12,360 --> 03:39:17,800
No, there's 0 and it's gonna be 1 because you'll be the pioneer.

5312
03:39:17,800 --> 03:39:18,160
Pioneer.

5313
03:39:20,520 --> 03:39:21,180
Pioneer it.

5314
03:39:23,120 --> 03:39:24,900
You'll bring it back.

5315
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:26,340
You'll start a new craze.

5316
03:39:27,080 --> 03:39:30,340
Maybe I can find a video of somebody opening cases and just say that I'm opening them.

5317
03:39:30,400 --> 03:39:34,160
Yeah, and then just play it and you put yourself on top of their screen.

5318
03:39:38,340 --> 03:39:39,220
Easy content.

5319
03:39:40,040 --> 03:39:40,480
So...

5320
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:49,640
Now you'll... Hey, maybe this stream wasn't even my gameplay in the end.

5321
03:39:49,720 --> 03:39:51,720
Maybe I just recorded it and put it over.

5322
03:39:52,400 --> 03:39:52,940
Oh, yeah.

5323
03:39:53,340 --> 03:39:53,780
Yeah.

5324
03:39:53,920 --> 03:39:54,900
We just recorded this.

5325
03:39:55,100 --> 03:40:03,020
We prerecorded it, the gameplay and then we just put ourselves on top of it because it's too hard gaming and playing at the same time.

5326
03:40:03,200 --> 03:40:05,020
I hired somebody to play on my account actually.

5327
03:40:05,220 --> 03:40:06,980
This isn't even my account, so...

5328
03:40:08,120 --> 03:40:08,940
Yeah, yeah.

5329
03:40:09,620 --> 03:40:12,280
I'm actually playing on her account right now.

5330
03:40:15,540 --> 03:40:17,540
She hired me actually.

5331
03:40:19,780 --> 03:40:21,720
You played both of them at the same time.

5332
03:40:22,880 --> 03:40:24,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5333
03:40:24,300 --> 03:40:28,940
I have like those paddles and stuff at the bottom where I can move.

5334
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:33,680
Did you see that streamer that tried to play Marble Rivals with her fucking brain?

5335
03:40:34,480 --> 03:40:35,560
No, I haven't seen that.

5336
03:40:35,760 --> 03:40:36,260
Oh my god.

5337
03:40:36,420 --> 03:40:36,880
I saw it.

5338
03:40:36,960 --> 03:40:39,080
It was on Shroud's Fragathon.

5339
03:40:39,500 --> 03:40:42,360
He had this girl that was on his stream.

5340
03:40:43,720 --> 03:40:47,880
It analyzes her brainwaves to move the controls and stuff.

5341
03:40:48,240 --> 03:40:50,880
And it was crazy because she did that for Elden Ring, I think.

5342
03:40:51,240 --> 03:40:55,380
She beat Elden Ring with just her mind.

5343
03:40:55,740 --> 03:40:56,240
Oh, yeah.

5344
03:40:56,340 --> 03:40:57,420
I do remember seeing that.

5345
03:40:57,480 --> 03:40:57,880
Yeah, yeah.

5346
03:40:58,020 --> 03:41:01,900
And then she did that and then she tried to do that with Marble Rivals.

5347
03:41:01,900 --> 03:41:07,580
It was crazy just seeing how her fucking brainwaves was like moving the character and stuff.

5348
03:41:07,840 --> 03:41:09,580
And she could aim with that, too.

5349
03:41:09,640 --> 03:41:10,700
I was like, Jesus Christ.

5350
03:41:10,940 --> 03:41:12,400
But yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.

5351
03:41:14,900 --> 03:41:17,520
One of them I played with my brain and the other...

5352
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:19,100
I don't know if that's possible.

5353
03:41:19,320 --> 03:41:20,020
Two at once?

5354
03:41:20,140 --> 03:41:24,760
So when Doobie was saying she was lagging, it was because my brainwaves was like fucking up.

5355
03:41:27,820 --> 03:41:30,700
It was because I was lagging IRL in my brain.

5356
03:41:35,420 --> 03:41:37,320
But yeah, that was fun, though, Doobie.

5357
03:41:37,360 --> 03:41:38,220
You had a great time.

5358
03:41:38,320 --> 03:41:40,340
Thanks for joining me for some Rivals.

5359
03:41:40,360 --> 03:41:41,680
Thank you for inviting me.

5360
03:41:41,900 --> 03:41:48,240
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to you in my chat, but I definitely had a great time playing with you.

5361
03:41:48,360 --> 03:41:51,780
You gotta teach me CS later and then we gotta do Heroes of the Storm.

5362
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:54,080
We gotta drag Mimi to do Heroes of the Storm, too.

5363
03:41:55,680 --> 03:41:56,080
Yippee!

5364
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:57,960
We're gonna...

5365
03:41:58,780 --> 03:42:00,180
I think we're gonna...

5366
03:42:00,660 --> 03:42:03,620
Dude, I think we're gonna revitalize Heroes of the Storm.

5367
03:42:03,760 --> 03:42:06,080
They're gonna look at the data and we're...

5368
03:42:06,080 --> 03:42:07,840
Peak player base?

5369
03:42:08,180 --> 03:42:13,420
We're gonna bring Heroes of the Storm a peak player base for the last year.

5370
03:42:13,560 --> 03:42:15,560
We're saving Heroes of the Storm, guys.

5371
03:42:15,760 --> 03:42:19,680
I think when people stream it, the viewers also wanna play.

5372
03:42:20,160 --> 03:42:21,600
I've seen that happen before.

5373
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:22,180
Yeah.

5374
03:42:24,260 --> 03:42:27,340
We're gonna save Heroes of the Storm, guys.

5375
03:42:29,480 --> 03:42:31,520
Oh my god, the doobie spin.

5376
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:36,720
I was trying to do something, but then I realized it doesn't work like that on my stream.

5377
03:42:36,820 --> 03:42:38,100
It's like a different window that I have.

5378
03:42:40,020 --> 03:42:41,300
It looked cool on my...

5379
03:42:41,300 --> 03:42:42,520
It looked cool on my stream.

5380
03:42:42,620 --> 03:42:43,060
That's okay.

5381
03:42:43,260 --> 03:42:44,120
It looked cool here.

5382
03:42:46,540 --> 03:42:47,620
Oh my god.

5383
03:42:47,680 --> 03:42:48,580
Jeez, rotate.

5384
03:42:48,860 --> 03:42:49,520
Do a flip.

5385
03:42:50,380 --> 03:42:50,980
Whoa!

5386
03:42:52,500 --> 03:42:53,460
She did it!

5387
03:42:56,020 --> 03:42:57,200
Oh my god.

5388
03:42:57,500 --> 03:42:58,900
I saw so many angles.

5389
03:42:58,900 --> 03:42:59,800
You guys can't see it.

5390
03:43:00,060 --> 03:43:03,040
I saw so many angles.

5391
03:43:03,260 --> 03:43:03,580
Wow.

5392
03:43:04,240 --> 03:43:06,200
Doki bird exclusive, guys.

5393
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:10,360
Yeah, gg's doobie.

5394
03:43:10,520 --> 03:43:11,560
I had a great time.

5395
03:43:11,800 --> 03:43:13,880
Let's do something again soon.

5396
03:43:14,600 --> 03:43:14,920
Alright.

5397
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:17,040
Bye bye.

5398
03:43:17,160 --> 03:43:18,400
Go talk to your doobers.

5399
03:43:19,020 --> 03:43:23,340
I'm sorry if that ended up being the name.

5400
03:43:24,360 --> 03:43:25,320
Unofficial name.

5401
03:43:25,680 --> 03:43:26,540
Unofficial name.

5402
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:27,880
They need something.

5403
03:43:29,780 --> 03:43:31,980
What's keeping you from deciding a name?

5404
03:43:32,840 --> 03:43:34,920
I just haven't been able to find something that sounds good.

5405
03:43:35,260 --> 03:43:37,940
Wait, get some fan suggestions.

5406
03:43:38,340 --> 03:43:39,420
Unless you don't think they sound good.

5407
03:43:40,260 --> 03:43:41,580
No, they didn't sound good.

5408
03:43:41,580 --> 03:43:42,040
Sorry.

5409
03:43:44,860 --> 03:43:47,380
They're like, passengerbs.

5410
03:43:47,760 --> 03:43:48,480
Doinguses.

5411
03:43:48,920 --> 03:43:49,560
I don't know.

5412
03:43:51,700 --> 03:43:52,960
They're not good.

5413
03:43:54,760 --> 03:43:56,960
What about dooberts?

5414
03:43:58,000 --> 03:43:59,580
Doobie and the dooberts.

5415
03:44:01,380 --> 03:44:02,840
I'll think about it.

5416
03:44:03,220 --> 03:44:04,180
I'll put it in the hat.

5417
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:05,800
Yeah, put it in the hat.

5418
03:44:06,700 --> 03:44:09,580
Alright, gg's, doobie, gg's.

5419
03:44:09,580 --> 03:44:10,480
Bye bye.

5420
03:44:13,380 --> 03:44:15,580
Oh my god, it was so fun!

5421
03:44:16,200 --> 03:44:20,740
I had a great time playing with doobie and talking to her.

5422
03:44:21,960 --> 03:44:30,200
And honestly, I hope that doobie and the unofficial dooberts can figure out a name for them.

5423
03:44:31,300 --> 03:44:34,020
I'm so sorry you guys ended up doobie-ing called dooberts.

5424
03:44:34,140 --> 03:44:36,160
I think that is not really the best name.

5425
03:44:37,460 --> 03:44:39,600
That's the first thing that came out of my head.

5426
03:44:39,660 --> 03:44:41,700
I was thinking about dobert.

5427
03:44:46,420 --> 03:44:47,720
It was really fun.

5428
03:44:47,800 --> 03:44:50,120
I'm really happy that we could finally play together.

5429
03:44:50,920 --> 03:44:54,020
Because we were trying to play Marvel Rivals for a while, but then I got into my...

5430
03:44:54,020 --> 03:44:57,640
Like I said, she wanted to play Marvel Rivals for a while now.

5431
03:44:57,840 --> 03:45:00,960
But then I got stuck in my Marvel Rivals rank run.

5432
03:45:01,460 --> 03:45:04,180
And this week I was like, oh my god, this is it.

5433
03:45:04,180 --> 03:45:04,820
I can do it.

5434
03:45:04,880 --> 03:45:05,960
I can play Marvel Rivals.

5435
03:45:06,200 --> 03:45:07,820
Or like last week, I was like, I can do it.

5436
03:45:08,020 --> 03:45:09,780
Oh my god, I can finally do it.

5437
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:11,560
I'm out right now.

5438
03:45:11,820 --> 03:45:12,660
I'm out of the...

5439
03:45:13,500 --> 03:45:14,420
I'm out of the pit.

5440
03:45:14,540 --> 03:45:15,080
I climbed out.

5441
03:45:17,320 --> 03:45:18,320
But I had a lot of fun.

5442
03:45:18,400 --> 03:45:20,140
Thank you everyone for the super chats too.

5443
03:45:20,800 --> 03:45:21,740
Thank you guys.

5444
03:45:23,280 --> 03:45:26,140
And thank you again for all the raiders and for Nimi for raiding.

5445
03:45:26,260 --> 03:45:27,040
I was very surprised.

5446
03:45:27,560 --> 03:45:29,720
Nimi and I were talking in the DMs earlier.

5447
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:33,160
I was just congratulating her for her debut and stuff.

5448
03:45:34,380 --> 03:45:36,840
And we want to do something together in the future too.

5449
03:45:37,640 --> 03:45:40,620
I'm really happy for the Nimi raid that came along.

5450
03:45:41,160 --> 03:45:42,100
I hope she's happy.

5451
03:45:42,260 --> 03:45:44,020
She had a great day and she had a great time.

5452
03:45:44,720 --> 03:45:47,500
And it was definitely a really fun stream.

5453
03:45:47,620 --> 03:45:51,800
I wanted to help Doobie get to plat and then call it there.

5454
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:55,360
So yeah, I definitely am glad we got to plat.

5455
03:45:56,100 --> 03:45:58,000
Honestly, I don't care about the rank of my account.

5456
03:45:58,160 --> 03:45:59,900
So I'm glad we were able to get her there.

5457
03:46:01,280 --> 03:46:03,680
Even though it was an alt account, I love her name.

5458
03:46:03,780 --> 03:46:04,140
DND.

5459
03:46:06,240 --> 03:46:07,160
Dookie and Doobie.

5460
03:46:07,480 --> 03:46:08,580
Or Doobie and Dookie.

5461
03:46:09,860 --> 03:46:11,780
But yeah, I had a great time.

5462
03:46:12,380 --> 03:46:12,820
I saw someone.

5463
03:46:12,960 --> 03:46:14,940
It's gonna have a birthday tomorrow because I won't be streaming tomorrow.

5464
03:46:15,320 --> 03:46:16,420
Thank you for the super chat.

5465
03:46:16,500 --> 03:46:17,120
Thank you.

5466
03:46:17,260 --> 03:46:19,720
Tomorrow is Hitominty's birthday.

5467
03:46:19,840 --> 03:46:20,680
Can you sing her happy birthday?

5468
03:46:20,860 --> 03:46:21,660
Of course I can!

5469
03:46:21,920 --> 03:46:23,180
Happy birthday to you.

5470
03:46:23,360 --> 03:46:24,680
Happy birthday to you.

5471
03:46:24,840 --> 03:46:27,280
Happy birthday dear Hitominty.

5472
03:46:27,280 --> 03:46:28,760
Happy birthday to you.

5473
03:46:28,820 --> 03:46:29,280
Yeah!

5474
03:46:29,280 --> 03:46:30,340
Happy birthday!

5475
03:46:30,780 --> 03:46:31,240
Tomorrow!

5476
03:46:32,300 --> 03:46:34,020
But yes, for those who are...

5477
03:46:34,020 --> 03:46:36,080
I guess I should show some stuff before I go.

5478
03:46:36,420 --> 03:46:42,200
But if you are new here, if you see the link, I do have a Nendoroid preorders out right now.

5479
03:46:42,500 --> 03:46:46,820
And it's gonna be gone in two to three weeks or something.

5480
03:46:47,220 --> 03:46:56,520
So if you wanna support me, please preorder the Nendoroid because if we get enough sales, we might be able to have a second Nendoroid with my corn skin suit.

5481
03:46:56,740 --> 03:46:57,300
So yes!

5482
03:46:57,680 --> 03:46:59,560
Everybody, I pinned it in my chat.

5483
03:47:00,040 --> 03:47:02,860
So I can copy and paste it too.

5484
03:47:04,520 --> 03:47:05,220
There we go.

5485
03:47:05,620 --> 03:47:06,900
Okay, I fucked up the link, I think.

5486
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:07,520
No, it's okay.

5487
03:47:07,580 --> 03:47:08,180
The link is fine.

5488
03:47:08,280 --> 03:47:08,700
I think it's...

5489
03:47:08,700 --> 03:47:09,060
I don't know.

5490
03:47:11,340 --> 03:47:12,140
Preorder Nendoroid!

5491
03:47:12,240 --> 03:47:12,640
Preorder!

5492
03:47:12,880 --> 03:47:13,280
Preorder!

5493
03:47:13,600 --> 03:47:14,380
Chill, chill, chill!

5494
03:47:15,100 --> 03:47:16,480
Thank you for buying my merch!

5495
03:47:16,660 --> 03:47:17,060
Whoa!

5496
03:47:19,540 --> 03:47:21,080
But thank you guys so much.

5497
03:47:21,400 --> 03:47:22,980
I had a great time playing.

5498
03:47:22,980 --> 03:47:26,040
I always get really nervous between collabs.

5499
03:47:26,620 --> 03:47:30,020
Collabs always make me incredibly nervous because, like I said, I don't...

5500
03:47:30,020 --> 03:47:32,700
I always be like, I hope we all have fun.

5501
03:47:32,840 --> 03:47:33,340
I really hope.

5502
03:47:33,400 --> 03:47:37,920
And then we can just keep talking and just chill and hang out and have discussions and stuff like that.

5503
03:47:38,020 --> 03:47:41,600
So I'm really happy that we had a great time talking.

5504
03:47:41,920 --> 03:47:48,020
And it was really great talking to Doobie and just listening to her insight and things and stuff.

5505
03:47:48,660 --> 03:47:51,060
But yeah, I hope you guys had fun too, watching.

5506
03:47:51,700 --> 03:47:57,620
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5507
03:47:57,760 --> 03:48:01,220
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

5508
03:48:01,360 --> 03:48:02,840
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5509
03:48:03,480 --> 03:48:04,320
Bye, guys!

5510
03:48:04,660 --> 03:48:05,080
Bye!
