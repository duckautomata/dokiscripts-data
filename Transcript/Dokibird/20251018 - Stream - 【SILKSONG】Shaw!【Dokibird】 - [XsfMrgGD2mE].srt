1
00:01:40,880 --> 00:02:12,100
hello everybody hello hello i had to push back the stream a little bit because um i tried to get my shit together uh because um you know when i missed that flight it was sort of a wake-up call and i came back to really i'm really really moldy ball and i was just like i can't live like this because i was like low-key I was thinking maybe I could just wait until my cleaner comes here and then she can deal with that.

2
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,000
But that's also like in two weeks.

3
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,540
So I was like, I should fix this myself.

4
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:26,620
I was like, can I wait two weeks or do I fix this myself?

5
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,560
So then I was like, I'm going to fix this myself.

6
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,800
To be fair, I was going to do this yesterday, you know, after the stream.

7
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,560
But I was so tired.

8
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,600
It was like 11 p.m.

9
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,700
And I was on like, to be fair, like when I was in New York City, I was on E.

10
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,480
East Coast time.

11
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,660
So, you know, 11 p.m.

12
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,100
is like 12, 1, 2, 2 a.m.

13
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
in New York City.

14
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:54,320
I was so used to like waking up early and, you know, not going to bed super late in East Coast time.

15
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,420
This is why I don't, I don't know.

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:34,100
This is why I like living in West Coast because like technically it's like a little cheat code where I can technically stay up a little longer because like when your knees kiss it's plus three hours and that like fucks with my brain um but yeah no so um so i like passed out like i literally just i was like i'm gonna i'm gonna lie down in bed for a little bit after the stream yesterday and um i woke up at seven a.m morning but if you think about it seven a morning west coast is uh eight It's like 10 a.m.

17
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,280
in New York City.

18
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,500
So it was an okay time.

19
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,560
So, and then when I wake up, I was like, oh, I should figure this out.

20
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,240
I should really, you know, clean up.

21
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,780
And I looked at the ball, and I was like, oh, my God, it's so gross.

22
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,440
I looked at the ball.

23
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,300
I was like, ah, I even, like, texted, I texted the dog sitter.

24
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,520
I was like, something came up.

25
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,940
Can you look after dad till Sunday?

26
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,840
You know, I didn't give the details on what came up.

27
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,020
You know, I was just like, something came up.

28
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,340
Can you look at, can you hold on to dad for two more days?

29
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
So he's not back yet.

30
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,980
Because, you know, I gotta get my life together before he comes back into my life.

31
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,400
I gotta fix myself before I add another person into this family.

32
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,700
Um, but that something is the mold.

33
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:48,900
Um, so yeah, so basically I, I put on the face mask, um, and try, I just thought I was like, I put on some, like the, the yellow rubber gloves, and then I was just like, okay, I gotta do this outside.

34
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't want the spores to like fucking bounce everywhere, even though technically it's been like, it's been populating.

35
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:27,960
the mold haunts me so I got I have a balcony so I just went outside oh it's just a face mask it's not like a fucking actual like you know ventilation mask I also bought an air purifier because I was like you should get air purifier it's like I should you should get I'm like whoa wait a minute I should get an air purifier I don't know I love this mold I've been dancing around my apartment um so I just ordered an air purifier.

36
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,580
And no, I didn't have one.

37
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,940
I had a humidifier, but I didn't have an air purifier.

38
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,900
So I went outside balcony, and then I just started...

39
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,920
I had, like, three other bowls.

40
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,560
Like, two of the other bowls, one was sort of starting to get moldy.

41
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,340
Because I had, like, two other...

42
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,520
I had, like, two other dishes in my fridge that also didn't finish.

43
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
So I didn't finish it.

44
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,340
So then, obviously, mold was starting to grow on that too.

45
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,080
So, you know, those two, they were starting to grow.

46
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,300
Like, it wasn't as bad as the moldy bowl.

47
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,080
It was not as bad as the one that I was like, holy fuck.

48
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
Because that entire bowl was just mold.

49
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,360
Because it was just starting to grow.

50
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,820
So I was just getting my spoon.

51
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,460
I got a wooden spoon.

52
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,920
And I just started scraping it, you know, into a little trash bag.

53
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,780
I don't know.

54
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:49,480
what color it is um i was a little like how does things become black mold no it was just a wooden spoon i threw away the spoon guys i'm it was just like disposable spoons so because it wasn't like green green it was like short of dark

55
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,460
yeah no it was a disposable So, I don't know if it was like black or not.

56
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,040
I think I didn't want to look at it to be fair.

57
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,300
I didn't really like look at it too long.

58
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:21,700
So, I don't know exactly what color it is.

59
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
pretty dark.

60
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:36,080
So, um, uh, anyway, I, I, you know, I, I first I was, I started padding it.

61
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
And then I was just like, oh, it's not coming out.

62
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,760
But like the entire bowl was mostly mold.

63
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:50,740
So I was just like, oh, I don't really, I don't really want to scrape this.

64
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,140
This is pretty gross.

65
00:07:52,340 --> 00:08:27,480
So I just, after I was like, pat, pat, and it's wasn't coming out i just left it in a trash bag because i didn't want to turn it turn it over again and look at it anymore i didn't want to i didn't want to look at it anymore so i just i was like okay i'll just i'll just leave it there i was like okay i'll just i'll just pay for a new I'll just take them.

66
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know.

67
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,980
It might be like $100.

68
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,160
I don't remember how much.

69
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,460
I don't remember how much the penalty was.

70
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,180
But I was just like I read it at that point.

71
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,640
I was like, you know, I did baby steps.

72
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,660
You know, I scraped the other balls.

73
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,240
There were two other balls that I scraped out that had mold in it.

74
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,520
I did that.

75
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,400
It was just, you know, the other one was like the alpha mold.

76
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Like the first.

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:56,900
that that bull was like the alpha and he won um i just i don't know i wanted to like throw up i wanted to like throw up so i i was just like i'll just i'll just leave it in there and then i put the trash bag in another trash bag because um i got scared because i was like oh what if the spores start clawing out of this other this trash bag so i'll i'll just put it in a dip in a giant trash bag and like double secure it and i left it outside about yeah i double layered it um and then i left it outside the balcony but i also kept my balcony door open because i was like oh i should air it out i was like oh no like with the mode fly back in i don't know i was like i was so scared and confused I was paranoid and everything.

78
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,580
So, and then, and then I, you know, I threw it, I threw it, I threw it out.

79
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,320
I threw it out.

80
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:13,200
I just wanted to like air, air the place out a little bit and then see if there's any other trash I need to throw out.

81
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:21,160
Yeah, so, uh, so I was just like, okay.

82
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:53,380
And anyway, after the stream, I'm going to clean more because, um you know my life's my apartment's a little bit of a mess like I do have cleaners come I do have cleaner come in every once a month but like um I'm a mess there's like boxes everywhere and I still haven't unpacked yet and I may or may not have like you know like when I was like I missed my So when I was packing my suitcase,

83
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,300
I still had like stuff from China in the suitcase.

84
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:07,460

86
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,260
And then when I got home, I was so tired.

87
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,900
I just was like, you know how you put your arm and then you drag everything and then it's on the floor.

88
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,980

117
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,700
And then I looked at Twitch and he's streaming.

118
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,000
That's just like, I was like, where is Moxie?

119
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,260
And I see him, like, he's streaming.

120
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:54,520
I was like, I was just like, bro, I had to do, I had to do a 1v2 during, like, rehearsal.

121
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
It was, it was crazy.

122
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,300
Yeah.

123
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,160
Um, all right, let's see.

124
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,660
All right, let's, let's play, uh, this is like song.

125
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:19,960
I don't know how much I'm going to get through for act three, because I know I heard Act 3 is a lot harder, so we'll see how this goes.

126
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,340
I have no idea how it could go for...

127
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,140
Oh, I have to update.

128
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,400
All right, JK, I forgot God.

129
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,040
This isn't like automatically update, so I have to like manually click the update button.

130
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,900
I mean, yeah, Moxie is a gamer.

131
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,480
Like he's been taught 500 in numerous games, so he doesn't need rehearsals.

132
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,180
He doesn't need a note.

133
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,240
What the fuck is going on?

134
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,300
I am booting up the game.

135
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,740
I was like, they're like, oh yeah, Moxie can't make it to rehearsal.

136
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,740
And I was like, oh, that's all right.

137
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,480
That's fine.

138
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,840
If something happens, I literally go on Twitch and he's fucking streaming.

139
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,960
I was like, I can't make it to rehearsal, right?

140
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,190
All right.

141

Who could have done this?

161
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:59,490
Oh my god, who could have done this in this poor village?

162
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,530
That's fucked up.

163
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,390
Oh my god.

164
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,410
What kind of fucked up individual caused this to happen?

165
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,910
You must find the one responsible for these evil deeds.

166
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,330
What the fuck?

167
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,370
Ow.

168
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,990
There we go.

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,510
Yeah.

171
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,630
Don't remember how to play this game.

172
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,710
It's been way too long.

173
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,110
Oh, wait.

174
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:33,430
Nice.

175
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,030
What's this?

176
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,270
Oh, it's extra lead.

177
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,090
That's cool.

178
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:40,750
Oh, cool.

179
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,350
It's extra lead.

180
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,490
Alright.

181
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,750
I gotta remember how...

182
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,050
I actually don't remember how to play this game.

183
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,150
It's been way too long.

184
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,210
Is there any extra?

185
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,030
Okay.

186
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,010
Is this a chapel?

187
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,930
This is not the chapa?

188
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,370
Wait, where the fuck is the chapa?

189
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,170
Oh, it's down there!

190
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,870
Okay, it's downstairs.

191
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,310
I thought that was the chapa.

192
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,510
Oh well, free health.

193
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,990
More HP.

194
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:11,790
Do I need...

195
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,170
Actually...

196
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,630
Do I need...

197
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,610
Am I carrying the right things?

198
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,690
Put it around.

199
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,130
Okay.

200
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,570
I need to make sure I have the right equipment.

201
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:57,070
equipment long claw uh I don't want the long claw decrease the cost of silk I don't even remember my loadout it's so locked I'm like what the fuck is my load what the fuck was I doing in this game I okay there is the chapel Guys, you don't understand if it's been like more than two days,

202
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,810
like three days, my mind is like, where am I?

203
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,750
Oh, hello.

204
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,030
Cowards, here you hide, even as you cause your own lands to mines.

205
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,690
See, it wasn't my fault.

206
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,110
It was their fault, guys.

207
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,570
It wasn't my fault.

208
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,910
Oh, it's the old man.

209
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,290
It's the racist man.

210
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,710
Our old guy.

211
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,630
You seem to spell the old one.

212
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,250
We only did as you asked, yes?

213
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:54,190
the snare is sponge the creature consumed you found it to that void don't play daft you should well know our family's fixation surely you had a hunch how else could we hope to trap one of your pale kin or see her consumed with such insatiable efficiency then you have miscalculated gravely the white knight she fell with further the mother Oh,

214
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:54,690
hell.

215
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,670
The Quake Kings, yes.

216
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,430
We have felt their force even here.

217
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,310
So the mother resisted the dark to save the child.

218
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,530
Wait, they don't, they're not wearing clothes anymore.

219
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,370
They're naked!

220
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,810
Oh my god!

221
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,370
Put some clothes on!

222
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,630
I just realized they're all naked now.

223
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,270
They're naked and free.

224
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:15,610
Husband?

225
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,490
This is my guess.

226
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,910
I must descend to the void below and see clear that truth for myself.

227
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,190
Oh, and unfortunate.

228
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,170
All of our loom will fall to her flailing.

229
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,510
So it may, but I will not watch Isla while it crumbles.

230
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,070
The groaning docks beyond the caverns of Bone.

231
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,410
There I have seen a vessel able to pass below.

232
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,950
A heavy bell built for descent.

233
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,430
I will only gain access and operator to assist.

234
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,430
I will investigate the docks and uncover the means.

235
00:23:49,930 --> 00:24:18,090
I'm going to be the first in an age to dive so deep old one that space below remains long unseen even to our family for those deaths i'm more prepared than most i will reach the base of this land and know the truth of the new disaster we together have wrote the shell is their cloth the shell hides nothing it's like a hat the shell is just a fucking hat.

236
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,990
Like, I see I could see their fucking belly.

237
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,150
What do you mean?

238
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,230
What the fuck?

239
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,350
That's a hat!

240
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,410
That's not a clothes!

241
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:36,770
Okay.

242
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,370
Uh, we don't need that.

243
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,050
I feel like.

244
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,250
I can see everything.

245
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,390
What the fuck do you mean?

246
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,170
Let's see, alright, we have...

247
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:59,170
Find aid in the deep docks to access its diving bell and descend beneath...

248
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,410
Uh, alright, we gotta go to the deep docks now.

249
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,590
Oh wait.

250
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,210
Am I playing it wrong?

251
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,330
How do I play this again?

252
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,610
Is it this?

253
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,890
Oh, there it is, I'm playing it wrong.

254
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,070
It's up.

255
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,250
Yeah, I actually gave the wrong song.

256
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,970
Alright, children, bring me to your mother.

257
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,010
And then maybe I'll give you a tip.

258
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,190
Alright, detox time.

259
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,940
We go this way.

260
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,800
Uh, where do we go?

261
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,440
What the fuck is this?

262
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,080
Okay, right down right.

263
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,160
Okay, right.

264
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,220
Right.

265
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,700
Down.

266
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Is that where I'm going?

267
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Down, right.

268
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Okay.

269
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,500
Oh.

270
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,580
I gotta sit down.

271
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,620
I'm so tired.

272
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,800
Oh, there she is.

273
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,760
Oh, she's okay.

274
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Look, nothing bad happened to her.

275
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Porch daughter.

276
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,480
These black quakes that now rack your hat lands.

277
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,740
I'm seeking to see them quell at the source below.

278
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,020
The lakes of bling.

279
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,480
Which did you send so deep?

280
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Won't you buy?

281
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,680
It is true.

282
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,260
These dogs possess a craft keep of both.

283
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,240
Unless we ourselves cannot help.

284
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,600
Whether filings help or fall, I charge ties us to this board.

285
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,740
But oh, there's the bug to ask.

286
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:54,680
And if our fate is as dire as your actions suggest, I'm sure he is only needing a gun quite convincing.

287
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,620
Alright, let's get that she's okay.

288
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,680
I need your help.

289
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,520
Sir, I need to head below the lake.

290
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,420
It's a flame.

291
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,360
There is a diving bell at the base of the structure that seems fit for the task.

292
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,180
I require it open and an operator to send it deep.

293
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,240
As one of you upon these docks with mine still sound, that roll must fall to you.

294
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:52,980

So it's got that bad, right?

296
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,220
I guess if that's how it is.

297
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll be...

298
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,280
Oh my god, she's fucking screaming.

299
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,960
Meet me below at the diving bell.

300
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,420
We'll see if I can get you ready for the drop.

301
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,100
Oh my god, guys.

302
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,580
I just realized the volume might have been super fucking loud.

303
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,860
Sorry, I didn't know.

304
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:51,620

Thank you, thank you.

308
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,940
Hey, Tokyo.

309
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,320
Moss Home Resident here.

310
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,100
I was just minding my own business when these black spirits suddenly killed them.

311
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,460
You know what?

312
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,360
Oh, nope.

313
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,300
Couldn't be me.

314
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,200
I was out on vacation when it happened.

315
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,520
So I don't know.

316
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,320
I was on vacation.

317
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,820
I was in New York City when, you know, when the black...

318
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,140
Dreads started coming.

319
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,260
I don't know.

320
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,560
This was pretty weird.

321
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,360
I was...

322
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,820
I don't know just as much as you.

323
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,700
I know as much as you do about what happened.

324
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,020
And that is like nothing.

325
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,880
I don't know.

326
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,160
Oh.

327
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,920
Oh, I do have enough simple here.

328
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,760
Such a mystery.

329
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
I think it wasn't that loud.

330
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,780
Because I was like...

331
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,880
I was like, oh my god.

332
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,640
That's...

333
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:25,610
um why is it okay down here i don't remember i could just do that oh oopsie that's five we yeah we oops okay left okay left down wee okay let's play all right left oh Can't go this way, but I can go this way.

334
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,510
I'm so paranoid right now.

335
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,750
I guess I don't have the magma charm, so I'm, like, incredibly paranoid.

336
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,410
Okay, I'm going to sit on this sauna real quick.

337
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,650
Let me through, let me through, let me through.

338
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,910
Okay, this is down here.

339
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,570
All right.

340
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,110
Oh, my God.

341
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,050
That was really bad if I fell.

342
00:30:52,310 --> 00:31:24,590

343
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,330
Be as best as any bug.

344
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,150
Then you've no power experience with this type of transport?

345
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,310
No one does, Miss.

346
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,270
Them's who used to dive all along dead or curse the half-life.

347
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,690
And there ain't no bug left alive been brave or stupid enough to try.

348
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,390
Till now, at least.

349
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,930
It'll work as best.

350
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,130
I can.

351
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,010
Can't do much more, I'm afraid.

352
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,230
At least the forging of these stocks were built to last.

353
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,810
gotta pray they hold for you.

354
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,050
Here's the key.

355
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,910
They'll see you inside this metal belly.

356
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,690
Pop in there once you're feeling good and ready.

357
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,870
In the meantime, I'll get to see things upset up here.

358
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,970
Oh, that's cool.

359
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:05,770
Alright.

360
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,730
Time to risk my life.

361
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,430
On the maybe I'll live.

362
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,490
He's never used this machine before, but it can't be that bad, right?

363
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,590
I've lived through worse.

364
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,390
It'll be so sad if, like, this is how she dies.

365
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,510
Nesvier?

366
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,310
Sir, I wish to depart.

367
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,210
Please ready the bell for travel.

368
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,910
Alright, like, she's been through so much, she literally killed a fucking god, and this is how she dies from a goddamn elevator.

369
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,550
It's like when, um, what's his name?

370
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,310
What was that guy that?

371
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,670
Oh, it's like when that mafia boss died because of an SDD.

372
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,690
Um, sure thing, miss.

373
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,970
Sit on the bench and I'll send you down.

374
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,040
Yeah.

375
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, Al Capone, like Capone.

376
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,460
Yeah, you guys didn't know that?

377
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,840
Oh yeah, and taxes.

378
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,960
He didn't pay his taxes, so that's how the Popo got him.

379
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,800
And then he died because he didn't get his STD treated.

380
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,600
Yeah, he didn't get syphilis treated.

381
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,300
So, like, it ate his brain, and he died.

382
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,960
Is to, or when we treat a spiel.

383
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,860
Oh my god, bitch, I lived.

384
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,340
That's right.

385
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,800
No one can stop me.

386
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,040
Sir, you can hear me.

387
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,540
There has been an accident during this end.

388
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,900
In the end.

389
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,220
In this broken state.

390
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,680
Okay.

391
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,520
Well, I got to sit in this chair, I guess.

392
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,740
Alright.

393
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,800
Bitch, I live.

394
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,780
You can't get me.

395
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,100
Alright, there's no map here.

396
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,800
Oh, is this the void?

397
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,720
Oh, my guys.

398
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,440
These guys.

399
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,980
Oh.

400
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,520
Okay.

401
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,340
So fuck these guys, though.

402
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,060
Oh my god, they're back.

403
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,800
These bugs are back.

404
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,300
The void bugs are back.

405
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,740
The abyss.

406
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,560
What the fuck?

407
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,240
Oh, okay.

408
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,920
So I do have to...

409
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,580
What do I do here?

410
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,520
What?

411
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,260
What do I do here?

412
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,900
Oh, there had to be like some stupid...

413
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,800
But oh my god.

414
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,540
Oh my god.

415
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,240
What the fuck?

416
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,940
I ain't getting out of here!

417
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,700
Oh my god.

418
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,600
What the fuck is that?

419
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,180
Okay, I got... I gotta get out of here.

420
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,860
I don't like these guys.

421
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,440
They make me very uncomfortable.

422
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,200
Oh, okay.

423
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:12,940
Oh, okay.

424
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,520
No, this guy definitely makes me very... Are you serious?

425
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,540
Oh, shit!

426
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,620
Okay.

427
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,520
Alright, well, he seems like a really bad person.

428
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,460
Just a maybe.

429
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,770
Well, he's like half boar.

430
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,110
It's not full boar because he can't, like, fully consume me.

431
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,150
Still not great, though.

432
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,190
Still not great.

433
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,490
Just go down?

434
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,070
A boar light, yeah.

435
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,530
Diet.

436
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:28,010

I might be dead.

438
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,910
I might be dead.

439
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,430
And I'm also confused.

440
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,090
Okay, we'll just go this way.

441
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,870
Oh, my God.

442
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,590
Okay, we'll just keep...

443
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,070
It's okay.

444
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,550
I feel very safe.

445
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,790
You should...

446
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,370
Use dash to go up this...

447
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:54,670
Oh, wait.

448
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,130
There's a chair.

449
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:55,850
Oh, thank God.

450
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,050
Oh, thank God.

451
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,110
There's an actual chair.

452
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,770
Um, I don't know if I want to use this tool.

453
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,110
No, I should, actually.

454
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,030
You know what?

455
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,210
Alright, children, come with me.

456
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,080
Oh, that's where she is.

457
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,800
Is that it?

458
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
Is that where...

459
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,580
Um, laces and the silk mother?

460
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,000
Here you lie, monarch, sunk so deep.

461
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,500
Still you cling to life.

462
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,780
Would you let your lands be choked black to protect just her?

463
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,180
Oh, hey, hey there, Lace.

464
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,400
A spider, dear.

465
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,140
What a delight to have you visit.

466
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,300
It is oh, so lonely here at the bottom of the world.

467
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
I cannot share your mirth, child.

468
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,100
Your small rebellion above now causes kingdoms collapse.

469
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,660
Letting you live was my rebellion, spider.

470
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,440
I've denied my mother your silk and strength.

471
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:37,040
mother mommy issues i've won she can thrash and waste and i know her pathetic broken child cause oh my god you can just talk to her communication is key at least your fucking mom is still alive my mom is fucking dead she gave birth to me and then she went to sleep and then she died in her and let it all come down.

472
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,600
Do you feel me?

473
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,880
I will not.

474
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,800
I've already stood the Sentinel for one dying land.

475
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,720
That role I will never play again.

476
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:57,520
While I live and possess the strength and then my brother killed my mom and possess the strength to resist this kingdom and the bugs within it shall not fall.

477
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
It's not a competition.

478
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,160
Spider, spider, what a marvelous specimen you are.

479
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,220
You fight and fight.

480
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,520
He lives as the world crumbles around you.

481
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:23,200
Barleymen or bugs will soon be crushed to dust, and so you'll be vainly swinging your blade.

482
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
There may still be a way to prevent that fate.

483
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,760
I will claim the hidden path, the bloom that repels the dark.

484
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,480
The snails share some fault in the snare.

485
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,540
use of the blade.

486
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,960
They shall help me now.

487
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,380
Seek its counter.

488
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,160
I will return, child.

489
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,260
When I bear the strength to die below and cut this line, finally free from your mother's grasp.

490
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,540
Goodbye, Lace.

491
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,180
Goodbye.

Oh, I have to go back.

504
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,300
There was a map up top.

505
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Okay, I'll go back.

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,500

00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:19,760
There it is.

509
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,020
I don't understand.

510
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,200
I thought we could like that.

511
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,000
Bro, did you not vouch for me?

512
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,900
The fuck, bro?

513
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,100
Okay, nice.

514
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,380

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,100
They got... did you beat that cheese with me?

516
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,680
Little bro self-absorbed.

517
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,940
Bro, that's fucked, man.

518
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,800
How the fuck do I get out of here?

519
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,470
What?

520
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,570
Oh, I have to go right?

521
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,370
Oh, okay.

522
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,930
He he, we're going back.

523
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:09,990
Alright.

524
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,270
Oh, fuck it.

525
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,130
Let's just go here.

526
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:13,790
Oh, I have to keep going, right?

527
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,530
That's fine.

528
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,530
Let's have the bench.

529
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,590
Oh, there it is.

530
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,890
I didn't realize that, because it looked like it was just the empty abyss.

531
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,370
Oh, nice.

532
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,610

544
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,730
Oh my god, that just scared me.

545
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,610
Wait, I... Do we?

546
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,950
I'm so lost.

547
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,410
It's right here.

548
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,790
Oh my god, I fucked it up.

549
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,150
It's so dark, I can't see fucking anything!

550
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,090
Okay, there you go.

551
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,530
Oh my god, he wants some warm... It's warm.

552
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,130
Oh, we're late.

553
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,530
There we go.

554
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,030
God damn it.

555
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,040
I just can't see shit.

556
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,480
All right, there we go.

557
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm here now.

558
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,240
It's like the abyss is like dark or something.

559
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,500
Oh my God.

560
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,880
Who would have thought?

561
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,850
There's darkness in the dark?

562
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,290
That's been crazy.

563
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:31,730
Far sight.

564
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,750
Um, the far sight can be similar at home.

565
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,150
What the fuck is that?

566
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,810
Over vast distance?

567
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:41,970
What does that even do?

568
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,110
All right, down I'll go.

569
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,930
As they say, down is up.

570
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,430
It's a progress tracker?

571
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,850
I'm a little worried going down this way.

572
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,100
Damn, not all boys know each other.

573
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,620
Turkey, geez.

574
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,900
Thank you for the super chat, Lolly.

575
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,060
Thank you, thank you.

576
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

577
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,480
Oh my god, that was just bait.

578
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,860
Wait, is it bait?

579
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,300
I don't know.

580
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,220
I've got to try this again.

581
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:52,340

582
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,800
What did I get?

583
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,840
I still get new abilities.

584
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,520
Crazy.

585
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,280
I thought I got everything I need.

586
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,600
Silk, sore.

587
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,800
Hold, and then left trigger.

588
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,620
Left trigger.

589
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,660
You would think that one would be up.

590
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,780
Oh, I can fly now.

591
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,740
What happens if...

592
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,300
Oh, shit!

593
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,880
I don't know.

594
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,540
I was like, what happened to the scene?

595
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,560
Do they just, like, give me a time?

596
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,140
You know?

597
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,680
I don't know.

598
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
I thought they would, like, wait for me.

599
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,260
You know?

600
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,980
I was like, oh, do you think they'll wait for me?

601
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,140
He didn't wait for me.

602
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,420
Oh, it's not.

603
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,700
I can't believe they didn't wait.

604
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,100
I was curious.

605
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,460
I didn't know if he would wait.

606
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Yeah!

607
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,070
I wouldn't know if it was a cutscene.

608
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,840
Maybe he'd do something silly, you know?

609
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,140
If I like waited, maybe I get an achievement.

610
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:20,740
Okay.

611
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,900
Well, now that I'm here, I guess I'll leave now.

612
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,720
Oh my god, no, not Diet War.

613
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,080
Goodbye.

614
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:37,380
Alright.

615
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,740
I can sit down.

616
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,060
Now I can lean.

617
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,310
Alright.

618
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,190
Time to use my newer build.

619
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,470
Watch this.

620
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,430
Oh wait.

621
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,210
Watch this.

622
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,170
Holy shit.

623
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,450
How tall is this building?

624
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:07,950
Right?

625
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,250
I was like, I did not remember this building being that tall.

626
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,170
Alright, we leave now.

627
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,770
Okay, now I see why it gave me that little shortcut.

628
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:22,790
It's tall, tall.

629
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,650
Yeah, I was like, Jesus Christ.

630
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,190
I did not remember doing that much shit.

631
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,350
Are you...

632
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:33,890
Oh my god!

633
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:34,670
Oh my god!

634
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:35,610
Oh my god!

635
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,890
It's fine.

636
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,570
They're like little moles.

637
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,990
See, everything is okay.

638
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,850
Oh, I did not like that that came out of his back.

639
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,990
It was a little unsettling.

640
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,410
Alright.

641
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,610
We're almost out of the abyss.

642
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,030
Too much to do.

643
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,930
Oh, I need to do this.

644
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,490
I'm like a little rock.

645
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,750
I wonder if I can take myself to the moon.

646
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:22,550
You know, I recently found out that all of this takes place underground.

647
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,710
Like, I just noticed that.

648
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,890
Like, we've been underground this entire time.

649
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,790
Because I'm like, I've thought, I don't know.

650
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,030
Because I thought, like, you know, there are moments where I was...

651
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,750
The moss?

652
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,370
I was like, is that not the Sun?

653
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:43,310
Like the mossy area?

654
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,550
I recently found that out because it came up in my YouTube shorts.

655
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,330
They're like, oh yeah, because there's like a, like, what was it called?

656
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,130
The Parkour Hell in Hollow Knight.

657
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,590
They have something similar for that in Silk Song.

658
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,650
I forgot what it's called.

659
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,490
The Parkour Hell in Hollow Knight.

660
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,950
Yeah, the Path of Pain.

661
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,610
So apparently there is a path of pain in Silk Sock, which leads to the outside.

662
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,090
And I was like, the outside?

663
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,310
Are we not?

664
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,030
Have we not been inside this entire time?

665
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,590
I was so confused.

666
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,790
I was like, what do you mean the outside?

667
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,230
Because like that moss home looks like the outside.

668
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,630
Because there's like, I was like, is that not the sun?

669
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,390

697
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,650
Okay, I actually got to focus up for this.

698
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,730
I can't fuck around.

699
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,190
I wonder if that...

700
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,670
Oh, it's all unlocked, thank God.

00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,660
Okay.

706
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,880
Clearly I didn't.

707
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,740
I thought I remembered this.

708
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:07,960
Alright.

709
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,560
There you go.

I almost remembered it, okay?

711
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:12,840
It took one.

712
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,320
It was only one thing.

713
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,380
And now we go here.

714
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,800
And then... I think I...

715
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,320
Oh no.

716
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,380
Okay.

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,600
Grab this first.

718
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,060
Okay.

719
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,120
My full focus on this.

720
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,640
Because this is bullshit.

721
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,190
This one's actually bullshit.

722
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,010
Are you serious?

723
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:48,950
No, please.

724
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,110

Yoink my children now.

802
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,780
Oh, my God.

You want your child back?

806
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,240
I demand 5,000 rosaries.

807
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,240
How good is you?

808
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,620
This is a kidnapping.

809
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,100
Oh my god, it's like beach volleyball.

810
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,840
Yeah, I'm gonna bring your child to volleyball.

811
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,590
Alright, uh, we gotta go.

812
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:26,310
Okay, Bonesman, fight him.

813
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,310
Don't see her.

814
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,050
She has like three more kids.

815
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,350
She's not gonna miss one.

816
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:38,670
If I...

817
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,110
I'm gonna raise it to be my own personal taxi.

818
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,930
So I'll never have to pay again.

819
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:43,610
Wait, what?

820
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,050
Oh my god, the thieves are here.

821
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:47,510
I mean, like, they're dead.

822
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,450
So, like, does it really matter to me?

823
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:52,530
They're just stealing from the dead.

824
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:55,710
Alright.

825
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:58,850
Let's go...

826
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,410
Is it here?

827
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:00,730
Oh, no.

828
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:01,950
It's all the way to the left.

829
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,750
And now raise your child to be my personal...

830
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:05,510
My personal Uber.

831
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,370
My personal chauffeur.

832
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,770
I'll never have to pay the fees ever again.

833
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:14,670
Hello.

834
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:17,430
Hello, I get the thing.

835
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,930
Let me rest a little bit.

836
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,910
Back from the destiny.

837
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,810
Nearly as scratch is it?

838
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:27,570
Is that as you fear?

839
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,110
It isn't worse.

840
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,270
Your snare has sunk the monarch deep.

841
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:33,590
Deeper than I can safely ascend.

842
01:02:33,990 --> 01:03:57,790
To cut fire them free, I must plunge below the surface of that lake of liquid nothing no shell survives submersion in that void old one not even yours not without aid though certain and though aid may exist the flower that resists the dark do you know of it the ever bloom we've heard the tale but i thought it a myth if ever sprout in our lands we should have we should would have surely known that's fine i would not seek it in these lands i need its powers full and it's too fragile to sustain here long i'll seek it in my memory wait i can do that i could just grab something from my fucking memory what if i just grabbed my mom oh so you have rush just open your soul they retrieve the fabled bloom can such a be done like if I could just grab something from my memory I can just grab my mom or my dad or another bug no I but I am a weaver enough to attempt it in the distant past I knew the flower my thread still hold its faint memory if the ever bloom was crashed strongly enough within my

843
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:01,550
yeah or my brother a big Bro, come over here!

844
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:03,450
You got the void power?

845
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,110
Yo, talk to the void for me, bro!

846
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,550
It can be made to manifest!

847
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,490
See, I could make it manifest!

848
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,890
Okay, the holiday night is...

849
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,110
Okay, not the holiday night.

850
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,190
Where the fuck he is.

851
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:28,070
The tiny little guy, the other brother, he's smaller enough to be the size of the flower.

852
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:40,070
Ah, so you're asking another spell of us yet the night to reveal the fire clear, but to eliminate one of your kind's own memories so acutely.

853
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,070
This is no easy thing even for us.

854
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:46,910
Oh, no one, you must give us a moment to confer.

855
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,950
They finished talking while I was trying to find my...

856
01:04:59,970 --> 01:06:01,610
cough drops where the fuck did it go oh we could do it the spell can be cast but another when a power enormous power equal maybe to that monarch to me again i cannot grant you mine if it were even were enough my strength is still needed face right below where else do we propose to seek a source from fire loom oh remember ours is a kingdom of wishes granted fire loom was not boring of that monarch old one power existed in these lands even before she bound them beneath her seek the old hearts of our kingdom and the last successor to bear their strength they're still out there in the way much faded by the pale one's long dominion you must make them stir we'll teach you how and the way befitting a weaver a sombre song to reach down in their memories and enliven them a final time All right,

857
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:02,930
teach me the song.

858
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,680
All right, I learned the song.

859
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,880
The Elegie of the Deep.

860
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:29,060
Okay, I can draw the memories of Barlooms forgotten past.

861
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:37,540
The hearts you seek, we can share their locations as best as we know.

862
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:44,920
They would be needed to construct their spell and draw a clear memory of the flower from your silk.

863
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,420
Bring us the hearts, old one.

864
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,700
Make him be fierce and final.

865
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:57,940
See for yourself the forgotten strength of this land of bugs before we burn those memories in its saving.

866
01:06:59,140 --> 01:06:59,680
Alright, cool.

867
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,120
Wait.

868
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,310

01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:48,130
Secret!

872
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:52,210
What is this little secret tunnel?

873
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,570
Oh, it's lore.

874
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:57,610
Eight mask hearts, world soul, and range.

875
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:00,330
Twelve accounts flat, all justice strained.

876
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,430
Six pilgrims living, hung long to drain.

877
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:04,930
Is that it?

878
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,250
Oh, no, there's more.

879
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:07,050
Okay, thank God.

880
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,130
I was going to be like, are you serious?

881
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,730
Is this lore?

882
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,310
Where am I?

883
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,070
Oh, it's like a little shell there.

884
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,330
Like, there's all the snails right here.

885
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:17,350
Damn.

886
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,190
Mine now.

887
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,350
They're all, like, I guess, like, dead snails?

888
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,970
What did I get?

889
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,240
What is this?

890
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,220
Oh, oh, a new crest!

891
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,180
Cast a blade for it and strengthen silk skills with power change crest.

892
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,460
Oh, it's like a, it's a crest for silk.

893
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,960
Oh my god.

894
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,120
Wait, what?

895
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,260
What the fuck?

896
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,400
Is this the mage build?

897
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,660
Am I a nerd now?

898
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,580
Oh my god, I'm a fucking nerd.

01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,760
Like, my, uh, blade does magic?

903
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,320
I want to try it.

904
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,800
Actually, I want to try this.

905
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:38,700
Is it...

906
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,600
Alright, is this blade actually good or bad?

907
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,240
Is this crest good or bad?

908
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,950
Oh, I can do a big beam if I...

909
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,190
I can calm me, ha me, ha?

910
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,470
Oh, oh.

911
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:02,750
Oh shit, wait, that's cool.

912
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:07,150
It's up to the user.

913
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,230
Use it for the true ending.

914
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:11,030
Is it actually that good?

915
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,230
Oh, oh shit.

916
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,150
Wait, I could do it.

917
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:14,670
Oh.

918
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,630
Okay, but what the fuck is this, though?

919
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,670
Oh, that's...

920
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,690
Oh, it's a memory locket.

921
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:24,310
I don't have more...

922
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,530
I don't have any more lockets.

923
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,310
I'm a wizard now.

924
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:28,250
I'm a what?

925
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:34,660
I don't know.

926
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,540
which one to use.

927
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,560
I guess like this and this.

928
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,420
Okay, but what are the magic that I can do?

929
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:42,680
Okay.

930
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,780
Up, down, and that.

931
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,020
Okay.

932
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,240
Yeah, I have no red slots.

933
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,700
Alright, I gotta test this out.

934
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:56,730
Alright.

935
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,550
Where can I test this out?

936
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,620
Hello, any children that I can beat up?

937
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,480
Where did they all go?

938
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,180
Oh my god, fucking Pussies.

939
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,960
They're all so Scared of me.

940
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:19,820
I don't understand.

941
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,080
The best spell for this crest is the one I'm missing.

942
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,120
What am I missing?

943
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,840
What if what did I get here?

944
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,630
Okay, I got there.

945
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,250
Oh my god, I forgot to build these.

946
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,010
The witch one?

947
01:11:45,910 --> 01:12:16,830

948
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,430
I know it's not the at one.

949
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,350
I heard she's like one of the hardest bosses.

950
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,280
Right is the at one.

951
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,820
Okay, so we gotta go.

952
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,300
Oh my god, where am I?

953
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,420
There's a map.

954
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,340
I'm so lost.

955
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:47,960
Oh, there it is.

956
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:48,660
All right.

957
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,880
Top left.

958
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,540
This guy?

959
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,540
The coral tower?

960
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:07,620
is this not the ant I thought that one was the ant is the ant this one I guess ant should be in the fire fields because that's where all the ant live which makes sense

961
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,860
makes sense I was like I thought this was where the ant lives

962
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:36,770
chat setting me up okay so I guess I'll go to the middle one then I guess I'll go How do I even reach here?

963
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,190
How do I even reach this area?

964
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,330
Like everything's like locked up

965
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,740
Grand Gate?

966
01:13:59,140 --> 01:13:59,260
What?

967
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,220
Oh here?

968
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,560
From the Grand Gate elevator.

969
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,460
This one?

970
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:07,960
Is it this?

971
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,900
Or is it this?

972
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,350
Which one?

973
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,220
Is this?

974
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,640
And then you have to go all the way here?

975
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:26,880
Oh, okay.

976
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,680
Alright, blasted steps.

977
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,780
Alright, take me to blasted steps.

978
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,800
Well, I'm gonna kidnap your children.

979
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,760
I said very calmly.

980
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,100
Alright.

981
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,300
Wait, oh, I don't have my fucking compass.

982
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:53,440
I just realized, okay, I still want to, I want to try this build out, though.

983
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,240
Oh my god, I can't even try this build out, I just realized.

984
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,100
I want to try it out.

985
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:05,180
Oh, shit!

986
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,000
Oh my god, okay.

987
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,600
Oh my god, he's so strong.

988
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,740
Oh, that's how I bind too?

989
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,760
That's a weird way of saying please.

990
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,780
Oh, there's pilgrims here now too.

991
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,820
What are they doing here?

992
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,480
Wait.

993
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,680
Oh, they take away my skill!

994
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:37,620
Oh shit!

995
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,580
I keep forgetting they do two damage.

996
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:42,980
No!

997
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,480
Where am I?

998
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:45,880
Okay.

999
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:47,900
Okay, I forgot to sit on the bench.

1000
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,300
Oh, I have to heal on the ground?

1001
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:56,560
I can't even heal in the air?

1002
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,740
Okay, I'm getting rid of this crest.

1003
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,000
That's the deal breaker.

1004
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,400
That's the deal breaker.

1005
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:06,260
Wait, am I...

1006
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:08,640

Oh, I'm already here.

01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,480
me on the ground.

1011
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,640
That's the deal breaker for me.

1012
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:32,790
Alright.

1013
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:41,470

1022
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:47,100
You guys- You guys are- You guys took me to the ad, didn't you?

1023
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,920
It's shut up.

1024
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,200
I fucking do it.

1025
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,240
I was like, she looks very womanly.

1026
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:12,640
This is not, I swear to God, if I, if I fucking go down to that elevator and I see a John ass ad, I swear to fucking God.

1027
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,100
Wait, how do I get down here?

1028
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:15,380
What?

1029
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,040
I go up?

1030
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:19,940
Oops.

1031
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:21,060
Oops.

1032
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,520
Oh, go up.

1033
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,300
Oh.

1034
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,540
All right, have fun, Dragoon.

1035
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:31,900
He can beat up this bat.

1036
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,120
Ow.

1037
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,200
And him, too, I guess.

1038
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,160
Anything here?

1039
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,060
No.

1040
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:48,270
So it's only me sure I'm not missing anything.

1041
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,740
God damn stupid steam.

1042
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,560
If I see a giant-ass ant, I'm turning this- I'm turning this car around.

1043
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,900
I swear to God.

1044
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,180
It's not here.

1045
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:12,340
Oh,

1046
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,250
there's a bench?

1047
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:23,630
Oh.

1048
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,070
I guess...

1049
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,890
I mean, I have...

1050
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:29,530
It's $15.

1051
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:30,530
It's fine.

1052
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:31,170
I can...

1053
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:31,910
I can...

1054
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:35,910
I can be the problem for a part of the problem in super capitalism.

1055
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:36,930
That's alright.

1056
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,110
It's a...

1057
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,890
Yeah, I can be part of the problem.

1058
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:45,870
Ascend and hold the left wall.

1059
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,370
That's the thing I went too far.

1060
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:00,550
Okay.

1061
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,880
Oh, there it is.

1062
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,370
Here, right?

1063
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,090
Let's be here.

1064
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:18,090
I will turn this car around if I see the ad.

1065
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,950
I swear.

1066
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,080
Okay, break vines.

1067
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:30,580
Oh, break vines, right?

1068
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:30,960
Oh, here.

1069
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,420
Oh, there you go.

1070
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,160
I got the shortcut.

1071
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:41,020
Are any of us here?

1072
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,820
Oh, my God, you're back?

1073
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,080
Oh, fuck you.

1074
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:46,820
I'm leaving.

1075
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:52,610
I got this.

1076
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,990
Secret.

1077
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:55,770
Okay.

1078
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:01,490
Anything else here?

1079
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,500
Okay, we go this way.

1080
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:11,840
Oh shit!

1081
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,560
You know what?

1082
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,760
You go kill him.

1083
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,080
I believe in you guys.

1084
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,280
Okay, guys.

1085
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:19,540
Okay.

1086
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Okay, Jargoon.

1087
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,260
Okay, there we go.

1088
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,920
I still believe in you guys, unfortunately.

1089
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,200
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

1090
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,040
Okay, that's fine.

1091
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,120
It's okay

1092
01:21:53,120 --> 01:22:08,480
Okay, I hit my head That's fine That's fine Just a little concussion That didn't hurt nobody It hurt me a little bit But like, you know what I mean Just a little flesh wound

1093
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:19,840
I I can't help it!

1094
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,020
It was just there!

1095
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,040
Oh my god, I forgot to grab this.

1096
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:30,360
Hey, what's up here?

1097
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:36,570
Oh my god, I almost didn't see him.

1098
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:41,110
I gotta get rid of the void.

1099
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,680
I will turn this car around.

1100
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,400
If I see the motherfucking at, I will...

1101
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:50,720
Oh hey.

1102
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:51,460
Oh, hey.

1103
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,280
Oh.

1104
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,680
Hold stranger.

1105
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,500
I am charged forever to guard the sacred shrine beyond.

1106
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,840
Any who wished the past must cross their weapon with my own.

1107
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:05,560
Oh wait, give me a sec.

1108
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,620
I gotta unlock a shortcut.

1109
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:08,360
I'll be back.

1110
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:09,280
Oh, it's him.

1111
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,400
It's the make a wish bug.

1112
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:14,800
Seth, right?

1113
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:15,940
I heard about him.

1114
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,000
It's actually pretty cool.

1115
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:19,900
Oh, there you go.

1116
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,040
What?

1117
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,380
Okay, oh, it's this way.

1118
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:25,220
Okay.

1119
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,800
All right, so I'm the- apparently Seth has a really cool- cool music or something.

1120
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:47,860
Yeah, he was a- it was a bug designed by one of the- I don't know if it was from Make a Wish, but from a child.

1121
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,900
That really loved Hollow Knight.

1122
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,140
Alright, let's fight.

1123
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,980
I just said, don't worry, I got- I brought a crew.

1124
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:05,200
Oh my god, oh my god, he doesn't care.

1125
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,620
Oh my god!

1126
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,160
Holy shit!

1127
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:09,540
I-

1128
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,780
Okay, um, that was, uh, the awkward.

1129
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:26,040
He has- he's so fast, my brain is- my brain is still waking up, I cannot Comfort ride, Seth.

1130
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:27,500
Okay.

1131
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,360
My brain is a bit too slow for him.

1132
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,000
Alright, I gotta figure out his patterns.

1133
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,500
Does it talk to him again to fight him?

1134
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,280
Or does he...

1135
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,080
Oh, shit.

1136
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:40,560
No, he does.

1137
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,180
He's like, no talk.

1138
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:42,580
No talk, just fight.

1139
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,460
Jesus, what?

1140
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,160
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

1141
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:52,920
He twers!

1142
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:54,740
Okay.

1143
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,380
Oh shit.

1144
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,760
Jesus.

1145
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,060
Okay.

1146
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,980
I need to use my...

1147
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:19,260
Oh my god, fucking teleport's behind you!

1148
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,200
I was not expecting that.

1149
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,220
Are you serious?

1150
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,240
Stupid fucking teleports behind you.

1151
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:33,960
Bullshit.

1152
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,200
Okay, I figured it out though.

1153
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,540
I figured it out.

1154
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,820
Nothing personal.

1155
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,020
Okay, I think I know his patterns though.

1156
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,000
I figured it out.

1157
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,980
I just wasn't expecting him to teleport behind me

1158
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,660
I got one knockback though.

1159
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,060
It was a stagger though, so

1160
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:30,220
Nice Jesus, okay Not expecting that Okay, I didn't expect that either I just expect nothing.

1161
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,000
Okay.

1162
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,140
Oh.

1163
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,420
There we go.

1164
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:51,980
I figured it out.

1165
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,160
Oh, except for that part.

1166
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,840
Oh, I figured it out except for that one part.

1167
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:06,870
Where I didn't figure it out And that part too But other than that I figured it out

1168
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:15,540
Yeah Oh my god bullshit

1169
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:33,040
Gotta be more careful no I remember when he does the slam dunk When he does a slam dunk, he dashes forward.

1170
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,700
I forgot about that move.

1171
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,400
That's so close, though.

1172
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,180
The timing.

1173
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,460
He's like, friend.

1174
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,500
I was like, friend?

1175
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,240
But you said, friend.

1176
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:51,740
Okay.

1177
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,180
Okay, I just want to grab this first.

1178
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,840
Oh, my God, I already forgot.

1179
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,460
He used the same move.

1180
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,860
already forgot.

1181
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,860
Surely, he's like, it's gonna work a second time.

1182
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,700
I was like, you're right.

1183
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:07,560
It did.

1184
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,900
Oh my god, fuck.

1185
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:11,420
And he was right.

1186
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,800
I was like, how did you know?

1187
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:25,100
Okay.

1188
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,700
Are you serious teleport behind me?

1189
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,520
I hate it when he does that.

1190
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:35,620
I hate it when he does the teleport behind me, bullshit.

1191
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:39,560
Okay.

1192
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,120
Okay.

1193
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:46,340
A dash.

1194
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,020
Oh my god, it's so much water now!

1195
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,680
Okay, I need you to get...

1196
01:28:58,220 --> 01:28:59,300
Ah, you...

1197
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,400
It just keeps working.

1198
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,240
I don't know how he keeps doing it

1199
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:12,870
Okay, nice.

1200
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:17,550
Are you fucking okay friend my turn to be friend

1201
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:25,010
Nice all right two staggers.

1202
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:26,710
Oh, I did it.

1203
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:30,590
Oh Shit didn't do it.

1204
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:36,730
I didn't do it I was like, yeah!

1205
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:43,070
Guys, I didn't do it, guys.

1206
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:48,970
Oh my god.

1207
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:57,020
I was like, yeah!

1208
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:00,480
Oh, Barry, friendo, friendo!

1209
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:02,580
I didn't learn.

1210
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:05,280
I never learned from my mistakes.

1211
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,000
I thought he was like, good job!

1212
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,600
I thought he was gonna be like, good job!

1213
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,780
You proved yourself!

1214
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:19,380
I think I should get the parry.

1215
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:22,960
I think parry might be good against him.

1216
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,220
Just a maybe.

1217
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,020
Are you kidding me?

1218
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,840
Are you...

1219
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,340
Are you seriously double combo me too?

1220
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,020
No!

1221
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:45,600
Okay.

1222
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:47,520
Okay.

1223
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:48,720
I figured it out.

1224
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,920
I downloaded you, Seth.

1225
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,800
That's right!

1226
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:54,620

1227
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,080

01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,120
They downloaded you for real!

1231
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:05,680
These other times I'm lying, but this time for real!

1232
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,640

I'm 99% down.

1236
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,320
I'm getting the deflect.

1237
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,060
I think the deflect would be better.

1238
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,360
I'm 99% down.

1239
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:26,880
This is it.

1240
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,480

01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,060
I figured it out.

1243
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,180
I figured it out.

1244
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,600

01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,730
Oh, whoops.

1276
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:02,450
Oops.

1277
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,030
I'm not a bad person.

1278
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,230
That's all right.

1279
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:06,430
That's all right.

1280
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:07,690
I'm not a bad person.

1281
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:08,870
Look, he started it.

1282
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:11,290
He asked me if he wanted me to...

1283
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,870
He wanted a challenge, guys.

1284
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:15,390
I'm gonna hold back.

1285
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,230
He asked for a challenge.

1286
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:20,070
I'm not gonna hold back on a challenge.

1287
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:20,930
Where...

1288
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:22,750
I mean, you died.

1289
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:24,890
He started it!

1290
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,970
He knew what was going to happen.

1291
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:29,590
It was self-defense.

1292
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:37,430
He already had his wish.

1293
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:43,070
It's called make a wish, not make wishes.

1294
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:46,630
Here we honor the seed that sprung the wood.

1295
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,730
By our grace, may all bugs pass.

1296
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:52,150
I told you.

1297
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:53,730
I told all of you.

1298
01:34:54,070 --> 01:35:00,410
I said, I swear to God, if it's the end, I swear to God, I turned this car around.

1299
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:01,250
I...

1300
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,310
I don't...

1301
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:07,690
I don't...

1302
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:08,590
It's not the ad.

1303
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:10,010
I swear to God.

1304
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:14,570
If I see a giant ass ad, I swear to God.

1305
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:20,530
If I see that fucking ad, this car is being turned around.

1306
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,990
What the fuck?

1307
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,560
Oh my god, wait, what is this area?

1308
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,940
Oh, it's like the...

1309
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,060
She's like a flower.

1310
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:56,100
She's like a flower god.

1311
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,180
I'm in a memory now.

1312
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,580
Oh, that's a nice memory.

1313
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,800
Look at how nice everything is.

1314
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,640
It doesn't look too bad.

1315
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,040
Hello, girl.

1316
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:21,880
Oh.

1317
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,240
Oh.

1318
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:30,590
Okay.

1319
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:32,130
That's nice to know.

1320
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:35,170
Oh, that's also nice to know that she does that.

1321
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:35,750
Oh, cool.

1322
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:36,950
She can also deflect.

1323
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:38,450
All right, that's okay.

1324
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:39,670
Okay, okay.

1325
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:41,170
Okay, I get it.

1326
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:41,930
I get it.

1327
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,110
I, I.

1328
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:48,890
Are you fucking, are you fucking kidding me?

1329
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:51,550
Oh my God, just fuck me.

1330
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:51,890
I get it.

1331
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,710
She's so big!

1332
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:57,950
Like, what do I do?

1333
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:00,590
She takes up the entire screen!

1334
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,950
She takes up 50% of the screen.

1335
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:08,530
Okay, but she's not too bad, I think.

1336
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:10,690
Okay, to be fair, I'm only in stage one.

1337
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,550
But...

1338
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:19,710
I'm like, yeah, welcome to the Thunderdome.

1339
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:23,490
Alright, I have to use my needle more.

1340
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:34,650
I just didn't think I don't know I I thought she would just stay there like in my head I was like maybe she'll just not move

1341
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:55,550

01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:13,070
What the fuck am I gonna do now?

1344
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:17,470
Oh, oh, okay.

1345
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:18,390
Oh, thank God.

Things got a lot more clear now.

1349
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,760
I was like, oh, that's easy.

1350
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:41,800
That's easy.

1351
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,220
I just gotta go back and forth.

1352
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,520
That's all.

1353
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,540
What happened to my floor?

1354
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,520
Wait a minute.

1355
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,300
Where did my floor go?

1356
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:57,540
Can I just like kill her in her sleeve?

1357
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,740
Like, good.

1358
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,260
Apparently it's easier to just pogo hair.

1359
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:06,040
Is it?

1360
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,260
Oh my god, it is.

Guys, never mind.

Now I know.

1365
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,400
It's not easier to pogo hair.

1366
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:23,400
Alright.

1367
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,560

Okay.

1376
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,550
I'll just wait for her to come over.

1377
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,050
I don't want to deal with this.

1378
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:28,030
I can wait.

1379
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:29,670
I can't wait.

1380
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:32,470
I can't...

1381
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:33,710
Never mind.

1382
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:35,070
I can't wait.

1383
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,450
Never...

1384
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:38,250
Never mind.

1385
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:42,070
You don't.

1386
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,500
But, um, I'm just gonna pass out a little bit.

1387
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:55,550
The green, the green, she waits for no one.

1388
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:05,270
I can't even poke, I have to say, like, uh, I thought I could pogo, like, the vines below, but silly me.

1389
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:07,270
Silly me.

1390
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,680
Jesus, I need to remember when she does that, I can do this.

1391
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,190
Okay, nice.

1392
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,010
We use this against her and then Toho.

1393
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:27,530
Okay, never mind, no Toho.

1394
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,630
Like I didn't want Toho anyway.

1395
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,210
Toho is for losers.

1396
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:34,730
Oh my god.

1397
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:38,110
I just get hit by everything.

1398
01:41:38,610 --> 01:41:39,030
It's okay.

1399
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:46,150
Right.

1400
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:48,330
Bye, floor.

1401
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:49,810
It was nice knowing you.

1402
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:52,170
It was a pretty cool floor.

1403
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,150
Nice.

1404
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,080
Are you serious?

1405
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:02,880
You know, I'll wait here.

1406
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:06,180
Oh, no!

1407
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:06,960
Ah!

1408
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:13,700
She was just standing there menacingly!

1409
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,620
I don't understand.

1410
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:16,780
She's a flower.

1411
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,460
She's a fucking flower.

1412
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,180
How much damage can a flower do?

1413
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,160
Like, oh, I'm sorry, I broke five ribs.

1414
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,340
I got hit by a flower.

1415
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:26,320
I...

1416
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,920
I got hit by a flower.

1417
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,940
Sorry, I can't come to work right now.

1418
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,520
Broke my fucking legs.

1419
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,640
Oh, damn it.

1420
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:48,190
It's not even poised.

1421
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:49,490
She's not even poisonous.

1422
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:54,750
Yeah.

1423
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:59,610
Jeez, thank God I got the luckiest.

1424
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:01,890
Oh.

1425
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:06,990
Okay, I'll just use that.

1426
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:09,150
I guess I don't just use that.

1427
01:43:11,690 --> 01:43:12,410
Oh, God.

1428
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:13,190
Oh, God.

1429
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,930
Oh, okay.

1430
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:15,310
That's fine.

1431
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,660
Goodbye, platform.

1432
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,080
We're pretty cool.

1433
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:28,710
Oh, God.

1434
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:29,150
Nice.

1435
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:31,510
Oh, I'll wait here a little bit.

1436
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:32,910
I can chill here a little.

1437
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:40,720
Oh, yep.

1438
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:41,960
Oh, Bob.

1439
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:43,880
so fine.

1440
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,740
Oh, it's so fine.

1441
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:47,720
Oh, okay.

1442
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:54,160
I need her to go down so I can have like a little bit of room here.

1443
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:56,700
Whoops.

1444
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:57,700
Whoops.

1445
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,640
Just get hit by everything.

1446
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,340
I was doing so well.

1447
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,260
And I was just like, you know what?

1448
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,740
I feel like getting hit by every single thing this bitch is gonna offer me.

1449
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:13,780
Oh, God.

1450
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:15,020
It's too late.

1451
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:24,740

1452
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,920

01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,080
My strategies.

1455
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,420
You can't comprehend my strategies.

1456
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:56,690
Alright.

1457
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:04,820
Okay.

1458
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,720
I could parry that.

1459
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:08,920
Actually, I should do that.

1460
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:09,660
Are you serious?

1461
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,620
That doesn't count.

1462
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:12,880
I was just out of range.

1463
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:14,840
Oh my god, I timed that.

1464
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,700
How is that possible?

1465
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,700
I timed that.

1466
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:21,120
It's not perfect me!

1467
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,260
That's crazy.

1468
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,140
Oh, that's- that's cool.

1469
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:31,960
That's also cool.

1470
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:33,640
That's- you know what?

1471
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:34,700
That's fine.

1472
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,540
Are you serious?

1473
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

1474
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,180
I didn't even do anything!

1475
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,040
They come over here.

1476
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,620
Oh my god.

1477
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,020
I don't know where else to go.

1478
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:02,940
I don't know.

1479
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:04,660
I could have actually just buried it.

1480
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,620
Okay, I'm locking in.

1481
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,960
I'm locking in this time.

1482
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:20,540
Okay, I'm locked in for real.

1483
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:21,680
I know what to do.

1484
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:22,360
Watch this.

1485
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:24,680
I know what to do.

1486
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,700
to do.

1487
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,440
It's time.

1488
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,400
Oh, someone give him a gun.

1489
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:35,620
It's time.

1490
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:37,820
This is it.

1491
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:40,880
I've unlocked my hidden potential.

1492
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:49,390
Okay, but like starting now.

1493
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,710
My hidden potential is starting.

1494
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:57,730
Are you serious?

1495
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:10,240
Jesus Christ Where did that guy come?

1496

Are you serious?

1497
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:17,050
Okay, that's all right.

1498
01:47:17,410 --> 01:47:18,530
I didn't need him.

1499
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:19,490
I don't...

1500
01:47:21,710 --> 01:47:23,970
Okay, this is not good.

1501
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:26,630
This might not be good, guys.

1502
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,620
Guys, it's a slow burn.

1503
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,160
Okay, it's a slow burn.

Oh, guys, don't worry.

1507
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:43,740

01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,420
Because I want to heal.

1523
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,300

01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:45,620
It was a slow burn.

1543
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,380
It was step one of a 10 step program.

1544
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,120
We did it.

1545
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:56,510

01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:01,350
It beats faint and fast.

1548
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:04,550
First try.

01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:09,050
So I can call up.

01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:10,670
I can call my children.

01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:19,330
Alright, we'll do Coral Tower.

1555
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:21,030
We'll save the Atlady last.

1556
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:24,410
I don't think I'm strong enough yet.

1557
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:26,850
Alright, how do we get to the Atlady?

1558
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:29,830
Not Atlady, the Coral Tower place.

1559
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:32,470
Oh, wait, we did this already.

1560
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:33,630
Oh, it's literally the same thing.

1561
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:34,390
We already did this.

1562
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,390
There's a chair here.

1563
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:40,750
I forgot we unlocked that area.

1564
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:44,710
It should be fine.

1565
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:46,990
Unlocked it already.

1566
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:51,750
I don't remember if I had to do all the parkour again.

1567
01:51:52,130 --> 01:51:53,550
Because I did unlock it.

1568
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:55,970
But I don't remember if I unlocked it fully.

1569
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:01,170
Oh my god.

1570
01:52:01,230 --> 01:52:02,750
Do I need to flex for him?

1571
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:05,050
Wait, I need a thing.

1572
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:05,950
Oh shit.

1573
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:06,950
Oops.

1574
01:52:07,610 --> 01:52:08,710
Guys, I should stop thinking.

1575
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:10,170
Because my mom's not parkouring.

1576
01:52:11,190 --> 01:52:13,230
It doesn't work too well.

1577
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:19,410
Parkorn.

1578
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:22,190
You don't think when you're parkorn, you feel.

1579
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:26,750
You gotta feel the parkour.

1580
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:32,890
Feel the jumps in your soul.

1581
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:36,730
This way.

1582
01:52:40,950 --> 01:52:41,850
Alright, up back.

1583
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:43,550
Yeah, unlock.

1584
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:44,790
Oh, no, I didn't.

1585
01:52:44,810 --> 01:53:13,710

1586
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:28,370
I don't need to go on a bench.

1587
01:53:29,290 --> 01:53:31,350
I just spawned outside his body anyway.

1588
01:53:34,650 --> 01:53:36,070
Why would I need to go on the bench?

1589
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:38,690
I'm literally in his dreams.

1590
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,730
When I wake up, I don't die in real life.

1591
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:47,030
Oh, oops.

1592
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:52,450
I guess I'll go to the bench.

1593
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:56,610
Never mind.

1594
01:53:58,210 --> 01:54:00,310
I guess I go to the bench.

1595
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:02,290
Alright.

1596
01:54:05,370 --> 01:54:06,470
Okay, now for real.

1597
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:14,790
Can't believe I went out of bounds.

1598
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:16,370
and it forced me to wake up.

1599
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:19,850
Yeah, I just left.

1600
01:54:20,350 --> 01:54:24,190
You know how you're like, you could take this mission, or you can just...

1601
01:54:24,190 --> 01:54:28,630
Oh, it's like that Pokemon game where like, you can just leave the city, apparently.

1602
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:31,330
I just left.

1603
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:32,810
I was like, I don't want to be a hero.

1604
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,170
Oh, that's beautiful.

1605
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:38,590
It used to be a beautiful place.

1606
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:39,730
What the fuck happened?

1607
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:42,690
What did they do?

1608
01:54:43,910 --> 01:55:40,810
Wait, you used to be pretty what the fuck do they do to it they like pollute the shit or something this used to be so pretty all right dragons do your thing you got this dragons do your thing oh shit what did they reflect okay I think I might have to change the magic oh no not these guys oh no oh wait it's not I thought it was the other ones I thought it was the one where they sent a stupid fucking ricochet thing I'm not scared of these guys.

1609
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:43,890
What the fuck are these though?

1610
01:55:45,130 --> 01:55:46,730
Oh, they're like freebies.

1611
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:51,610
Okay, I'll heal now for now.

1612
01:55:53,650 --> 01:55:54,830
Oh, I definitely want to change my...

1613
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,610
I think it's too late to change it.

1614
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:01,190
I definitely don't...

1615
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:02,870
Oh, I don't like the magic for this.

1616
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:08,430
I'm tanking it, I'm tanking all of it.

1617
01:56:13,870 --> 01:56:14,670
Nice.

1618
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:17,290
Oh.

1619
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:20,550
Yeah, we did it.

1620
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:21,010
Ow.

1621
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:25,310
And that gets a critical hit?

1622
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:37,110
I like how, like, random enemy number one, the random mob gets the critical hit.

1623
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:41,890
I like the deflector.

1624
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:43,090
minions.

1625
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:47,830
Are you serious?

1626
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:51,370
Okay.

1627
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:56,010
Oh my god, I missed.

1628
01:56:56,330 --> 01:56:57,330
I fucking missed.

1629
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:59,850
It's fine.

1630
01:57:00,730 --> 01:57:01,910
It's fine.

1631
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:04,650
It'll work.

1632
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:05,190
No!

1633
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:09,570
I didn't take you to double it.

1634
01:57:10,110 --> 01:57:10,570
I didn't.

1635
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,430
I was like, it's fine.

1636
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:12,690
I can just this.

1637
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:17,630
I thought I thought I knew.

1638
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:20,150
Okay, I also need to get rid of the map, the deflect.

1639
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:27,010
I think deflect is fine against bosses, but when I'm fighting against the little guys, it's just very annoying.

1640
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:32,830
I, in fact, cannot tank it.

1641
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:33,890
Who would have thought?

1642
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:35,710
It's crazy.

1643
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:46,280
Uh,

1644
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:53,150
when this place became did they do fracking like is that it

1645
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:05,060
there are too many cars okay okay too many cars and factories so it over polluted

1646
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,120
too real

1647
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:27,940
oh my god did not mean to heal oopsie

1648
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:31,900
Alright.

1649
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:33,740
I mean, these guys are easy.

1650
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:35,880
You know what?

1651
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:36,460
Fuck it.

1652
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:38,700
Oh shit.

1653
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:40,240
I guess not for him though.

1654
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,980
You know what?

1655
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:45,580
I'll heal.

1656
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:49,840
How did I get hit by that?

1657
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:51,260
I was using a magic spell!

1658
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:57,060
Okay, thank God my needle is maxed still.

1659
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:58,720
I don't know how I'm gonna fuck me.

1660
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:02,240
How would I have survived if my needles weren't maxed out?

1661
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,000
There we go.

1662
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:10,660
One!

1663
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,740
All right, give me the silk.

1664
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:17,980
Yay!

1665
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:23,660
All right.

1666
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,100
These guys are not that hard.

1667
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:31,640
Okay.

1668
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,400
Yeah.

1669
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:34,860
I see it.

1670
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:36,860
What?

1671
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,180
You can interrupt that?!

1672
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:40,080
That's bullshit!

1673
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:48,260
Alright, nice.

1674
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:51,640
What the fuck is that?

1675
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:53,120
Oh, it's just for silk.

1676
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:53,520
Okay.

1677
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,360
It's just a silk bar.

1678
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:56,540
I mean, that's nice.

1679
01:59:56,980 --> 01:59:58,160
I'll just leave that here.

1680
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:00,760
Oh, no, it's these guys.

1681
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:01,840
Oh, these guys I hate.

1682
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:04,400
They're the ricochet.

1683
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,620
Can I destroy this?

1684
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:09,330
No, I can't.

1685
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,100
No, wait, wait, no, not my stealth!

1686
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,540
Don't destroy the stealth dragon!

1687
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:20,980
Stealth!

1688
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:22,920
You killed everything!

1689
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:23,980
Fuck the minions!

1690
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:25,220
Okay.

1691
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:29,360
Oh, no.

1692
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,080
Oh, no.

1693
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:34,720
Oh, no!

1694
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,200
Oh, no!

1695
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:38,120
It's over!

1696
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,640
It's so...

1697
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:40,320
Over

1698
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:49,060
Okay, wait wait second life second life

1699
02:00:53,980 --> 02:01:09,160
You serious Oh my god, please Just let me all let me hit you at least once I hate this

1700
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,760
This, I...

1701
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:17,360
Oh, God.

1702
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:18,480
He was right there.

1703
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,440
Are you fucking kidding me?

1704
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:29,620
Oh, no.

1705
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:30,640
Oh, no.

1706
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,080
Oh, no.

1707
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:33,900
Oh, no.

1708
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:34,600
Oh, no.

1709
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,040
I don't feel so good.

1710
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:38,100
I don't...

1711
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,300
Okay, these guys actually...

1712
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:42,780
Are you...

1713
02:01:42,780 --> 02:01:42,860
Oh.

1714
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:47,510
I'm like, get it!

1715
02:01:47,850 --> 02:01:48,250
No!

1716
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:51,610
It's just...

1717
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:52,830
I don't know what to do.

1718
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:54,690
They just...

1719
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:58,070
They just start running, and I'm like, I must follow.

1720
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:02,710
What if I just touch it?

1721
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:07,170
The big boys, I just want to touch it.

1722
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:16,470
I swear, I swear to God.

1723
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:22,530
I feel like the arena's the hard part and then the boss itself would be like a lot easier.

1724
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:26,610
I couldn't help it.

1725
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:30,090
His ass was like the moon.

1726
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:33,710
And then I just wanted to follow it.

1727
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:38,990
I was a lamp drawn by the ass.

1728
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:58,240
Why the fuck did he come here?

1729
02:02:58,260 --> 02:02:59,080
Brog!

1730
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:02,960
Alright.

1731
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,740
You know what?

1732
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,460
I'm just gonna get rid- Are you serious?

1733
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:10,840
Just gonna heal real quick.

1734
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,320
Oh my god!

1735
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:13,600
Okay, I guess not!

1736
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:16,620
No healing for me!

1737
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:24,290
Alright.

1738
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:25,930
I'll heal here.

1739
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:30,790
Alright, her sister here is back to avenge her sister.

1740
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:36,110
All right.

1741
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:41,560
It's okay.

1742
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:43,700
You can face take in the first round.

1743
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,540
I've learned.

1744
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:47,960
I mean, I don't have to, but I'm lazy.

1745
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:53,220
When the...

1746
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:56,940
When the moon hits the eye...

1747
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:00,820
It's Amori.

1748
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:08,380
himself.

1749
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:14,320
Yeah, I got the crit on the silk guy.

1750
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:16,420
I don't get the crit when it matters.

1751
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:19,940
Are you fucking...

1752
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:22,560
Oh my god, tip over here!

1753
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:25,820
I swear to god.

1754
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:26,600
Oh, thank god.

1755
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:26,940
Okay.

1756
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,920
I know, like, these don't take a lot of his.

1757
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:37,920
Thank god, too.

1758
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:39,740
Alright.

1759
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:44,640
Get out of here.

1760
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:49,240
Okay, I'll use the silk and then...

1761
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:51,240
He can fight back!

1762
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:56,440
I thought you were just here for the silk!

1763
02:04:57,700 --> 02:05:00,380
I didn't realize you could actually fight back!

1764
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:02,460
Since when?

1765
02:05:11,150 --> 02:05:11,790
Okay.

1766
02:05:13,190 --> 02:05:15,190
I'm just gonna grab this for now.

1767
02:05:16,630 --> 02:05:18,850
I just need to know that...

1768
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:22,090
When he does that, he summons a little Koro shit.

1769
02:05:22,370 --> 02:05:23,290
Oh, there he goes.

1770
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:24,710
Summoning the Koro shit.

1771
02:05:31,190 --> 02:05:32,770
Alright, friend time.

1772
02:05:36,050 --> 02:05:36,730
There we go.

1773
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:39,850
Maybe a Dracus.

1774
02:05:40,030 --> 02:05:40,550
Oh, nope.

1775
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:41,250
Dracus, no!

1776
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:42,510
No, that's my silk!

1777
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:48,170
A one time.

1778
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:48,850
He'll

1779
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:54,070
hit.

1780
02:05:55,850 --> 02:05:56,410
Friend.

1781
02:05:58,270 --> 02:05:58,550
Alright.

1782
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:00,670
Oh, and he's dead.

1783
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:02,730
You know, he tried.

1784
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,000
Don't jump, please.

1785
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:14,930
Oh my god.

1786
02:06:15,470 --> 02:06:15,890
Thank god.

1787
02:06:16,830 --> 02:06:17,630
Alright, we did it.

1788
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:18,850
Oh, we did it.

1789
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:21,750
I just had enough magic to use it.

1790
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:23,950
Our silk now.

1791
02:06:27,470 --> 02:06:28,270
Is there a shortcut?

1792
02:06:29,110 --> 02:06:31,830
Oh, please tell me there's a shortcut.

1793
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:35,230
There's...

1794
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:36,810
Okay, there's still...

1795
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:38,670
Oh my god, you fucker.

1796
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:41,690
Okay, there's still...

1797
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:43,030
Where's the shortcut?

1798
02:06:44,870 --> 02:06:46,130
Where's the shortcut?

1799
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51,030
Shortcut?

1800
02:06:55,690 --> 02:06:57,450
Guys, this is silly.

1801
02:06:57,470 --> 02:07:00,850
Shirley, the shirt coat is somewhere...

1802
02:07:00,850 --> 02:07:02,810
Not yet.

1803
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,510
It was you guys.

1804
02:07:04,810 --> 02:07:07,270
Shirley, the shirt coat is like right beside me, right?

1805
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:17,410
Oh my god, they decided not to come closer.

1806
02:07:17,890 --> 02:07:19,470
They fucking...

1807
02:07:20,210 --> 02:07:22,930
Are you serious?

1808
02:07:24,190 --> 02:07:26,710
Oh my god, they're actually locking me in.

1809
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:32,370
Oh, nice.

1810
02:07:32,770 --> 02:07:32,770
Okay.

1811
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:34,650
That's good.

1812
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:38,630
Maybe they'll get closer, right?

1813
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:44,870
Please, if you want to engage in this fight, you have to get closer to me.

1814
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:45,410
I know.

1815
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:48,050
I know it's a crazy concept.

1816
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,120
All right.

1817
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:02,860
This guy, I hate this guy.

1818
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:04,820
I hate him.

1819
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,360
I'm fucking gonna slam dunk him.

1820
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:13,560
Jesus Christ.

1821
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:15,140
Friend.

1822
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,940
Where am I?

1823
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:21,740
Okay.

1824
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,300
This is fine.

1825
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:28,500
I don't want to waste any of my silk magic on him.

1826
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:31,560
Okay, he'll slam dunk.

1827
02:08:35,220 --> 02:08:37,040
I'm just gonna waste it.

1828
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:38,480
Wait, what is he?

1829
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,580
What the fuck?

1830
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,320
What is this?

1831
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:43,400
What is this guy do?

1832
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,160
He's just bubbling.

1833
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:49,280
Okay.

1834
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:52,200
Grab this for the free still.

1835
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,600
He's like a bubbly man.

1836
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:56,280
Oh, not him again.

1837
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,260
Oh, God, not him again.

1838
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:01,140
Okay, there's more.

1839
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:02,020
Oh, shit!

1840
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:02,760
There's...

1841
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,540
Oh, fuck!

1842
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:04,540
Of course I'll waste it!

1843
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:13,220
I'm just going to use some magic for now.

1844
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:16,840
Because I don't trust myself!

1845
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:19,360
See, this is why I don't trust myself.

1846
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:22,840
There you go.

1847
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:23,640
Oh?

1848
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:24,840
Oh.

1849
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:26,740
That's not cool.

1850
02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:29,120
Oh.

1851
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:33,000
Um...

1852
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:42,000
Oh Really oh

1853
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:51,380
You just float right here.

1854
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,940
Oh, okay.

1855
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:53,500
Don't worry.

1856
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:55,820
He'll yeah, he cleared it.

1857
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:56,040
Ah

1858
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:01,960
Look he he did clear it.

1859
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:03,680
I just wasn't

1860
02:10:08,570 --> 02:10:13,990
Okay He technically did clear it.

1861
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:16,810
There we go.

1862
02:10:17,130 --> 02:10:17,430
Nice.

1863
02:10:19,830 --> 02:10:22,110
Okay, I don't know- oh shit!

1864
02:10:22,830 --> 02:10:24,790
I'm like really scared about this guy.

1865
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:26,670
So I'm gonna use all my silk for that.

1866
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:32,350
Like I don't know what the bubble mana actually can do.

1867
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:36,030
He's fucking kidding me?

1868
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:37,330
Are you- Ah!

1869
02:10:40,050 --> 02:10:41,110
Ah shit!

1870
02:10:44,110 --> 02:10:46,090
Oh, God.

1871
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:49,090
Oh, God.

1872
02:10:51,170 --> 02:10:52,590
Okay, slow and steady.

1873
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:54,230
Throw your little thingy.

1874
02:10:55,390 --> 02:10:56,450
Okay, I'll just...

1875
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:59,170
It was a bit too slow.

1876
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:01,250
What?

1877
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:02,690
Okay.

1878
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:04,950
Oh, my God!

1879
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:06,250
Okay,

1880
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:12,300
nice.

1881
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:15,560
Oh, thank God.

1882
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:18,100
Thank you for the free stuff.

1883
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:23,080
Thank you.

1884
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:23,740
Thank you.

1885
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:24,700
You're so kind.

1886
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,180
You're so kind.

1887
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,940
Thank you so much for this freestyle.

1888
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:30,180
Come, yum, yum, yum.

1889
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:31,520
Alright.

1890
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:32,620
We did it.

1891
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:35,000
We fucking did it.

1892
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:36,780
We're at the boss.

1893
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,300
Was that the shortcut?

1894
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,340
Oh, we got the shortcut.

1895
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:41,080
Yay!

1896
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:44,840
This has to do with the boss now.

1897
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:47,360
Thank you for the crumbs.

1898
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:49,160
You were so nice to me.

1899
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:50,120
I'll just blow you up.

1900
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:55,200
Wait, this isn't a boss, but...

1901
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,360
This is just a minions.

1902
02:11:58,620 --> 02:11:59,180
Oh, nice.

1903
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:08,550
Okay.

1904
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,770
Oh, okay, goodbye.

1905
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:12,630
Goodbye, free soot.

1906
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:14,250
I never need it.

1907
02:12:15,070 --> 02:12:15,910
I hate this.

1908
02:12:16,230 --> 02:12:17,110
Are you kidding me?

1909
02:12:19,190 --> 02:12:19,830
Ah!

1910
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:22,670
Okay, that's fine.

1911
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:24,750
That's not fine.

1912
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:58,530
God stop the not the geometry not geometry it's always geometry oh my god she jumps back I'm so confused there's so many things to dodge

1913
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:06,120
All right, there we go.

1914
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:08,160
Oh.

1915
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:12,640
Oh, we made it.

1916
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:19,180
Yay!

1917
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:24,540
Yay!

1918
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:25,760
Okay.

1919
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:27,900
This is the king now.

1920
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,060
Hello, king.

1921
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:30,280
Am I worthy?

1922
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:33,080

02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:39,180
I have no idea what your pattern is.

1925
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:40,640
Crust King.

1926
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:41,940
I thought I said like Genghis King.

1927
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:43,040
I was like, oh my god.

1928
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:44,180
Bug Kang?

1929
02:13:44,980 --> 02:13:46,020
Oh shit.

1930
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:48,200
Grand.

1931
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:52,180
Alright.

1932
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,480
I was like, oh my god.

1933
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:01,880
There's a Genghis Kang a fucking...

1934
02:14:01,880 --> 02:14:02,660
Buzz?

1935
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,820

1938
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:43,460
mean like he's pretty predictable so far

1939
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:49,000
Like, he just uses the power of spikes.

1940
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:51,720
Oh, he ain't, like, actually gaming.

1941
02:14:54,060 --> 02:14:55,180
Like, I literally just...

1942
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:56,380
I just hit him.

1943
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:01,580
He does more damage by just existing.

1944
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,660
Other than anything else.

1945
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:16,370
Literally, only damage he does is just he stands on me.

1946
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:23,070
I don't keep this I can't help it

1947
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:37,090

Like, I can't even get close to you!

1952
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:20,140
He just blocks everything!

1953
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:21,860
He's like, no touchy.

1954
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,020

02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:27,060

02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:39,100

Oh, I'm skipping all the silk, though.

1967
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:49,300
It's fine.

1968
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:51,220
Do I have to...

1969
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:52,780
Oh, I have to fight these guys again.

1970
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:53,760
Oh, fuck.

1971
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:55,720
I didn't realize I had to do the arena again.

1972
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:58,560
Yeah, it's fine.

1973
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:04,160
Okay.

1974
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:06,160
I could do about the deflect.

1975
02:18:07,060 --> 02:18:07,900
You should be fine.

1976
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:12,200
Oh, wait.

1977
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:13,740
No, it's not fine.

1978
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:16,960
Wait a minute.

1979
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:18,680
It might not be fine.

1980
02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:22,840
Because then I lose Bubbly Mad.

1981
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:32,900
It's just more tedious fighting.

1982
02:18:33,740 --> 02:18:34,140
Bubbly Mad.

1983
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:36,280
Are you serious?

1984
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,640
Oh, God.

1985
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:42,940
Damn geometry!

1986
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:45,500
My one weakness!

1987
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:55,300
Okay.

02:18:59,410 --> 02:18:59,790
Alright.

1989
02:19:00,330 --> 02:19:01,350
Get out of here.

02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:09,400
Alright, nice.

1991
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:14,860
I didn't have to do that, I just wanted to flex a little.

1992
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:19,360
Alright.

1993
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:21,580
Now I should be able to go back up.

1994
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:29,180
Rocket time.

1995
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:34,460
Okay, maybe deflect would be a little easier.

1996
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,360
Also, I got you guys here along for this fight.

1997
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,760
I swear, I felt like I was fucking...

1998
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:42,560
I stabbed him so many times.

1999
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:50,020
I felt like I was stabbing him so many times.

2000
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:51,800
Wait.

2001
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:52,600
Oh.

2002
02:19:54,160 --> 02:20:04,000
I was trying to do that Look, there was a plan I just might have fucked up my original plan

2003
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:12,780
What?

2004
02:20:19,860 --> 02:20:20,880
That doesn't work?

2005
02:20:24,580 --> 02:20:26,680

It's fine.

2009
02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:54,690
I don't know when I can use my dip deck, but it's fine.

2010
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:58,510
It's so fine There you go

2011
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:02,830

Holy shit.

2018
02:21:24,220 --> 02:21:25,960
This was so much faster.

2019
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:29,060
What the fuck happened in the first fight?

2020
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,340
I swear it took like 80.

2021
02:21:34,380 --> 02:21:37,100
Like, he just stopped doing defense.

2022
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:37,880
He's like, you know what?

2023
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:41,600
Maybe I could try 99% defense.

2024
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:43,020
Our claws to crush.

2025
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,420
Our claws to rule.

2026
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:47,020
Our claws to save them all.

2027
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:53,100
Like, now, I was like, now it's like 99% defense.

2028
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,980
I swear, the first fight was 100% defense.

2029
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:58,620
He would not even let me get close.

2030
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,660

Oh, God.

2099
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:07,460
Oh!

2100
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:20,980

2101
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:25,780

This little guy also decides to fuck me up.

Oh.

2125
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:29,870
That's not okay.

2126
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,650
That's not okay.

2127
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:42,580
Okay, we got one of them.

2128
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,740

2129
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:49,460
Oh my god, okay.

That's okay.

2131
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:52,800
Alright, Dragon, I'm bringing you into this fight.

2132
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:58,180
You're coming into this fight, whether you like it or not.

2133
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:02,840
Yeah, I'm going to hell with me.

2134
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:12,380
Are you serious?

2135
02:30:17,330 --> 02:30:17,970
Oh, you guys.

2136
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:18,650
Friend.

2137
02:30:19,590 --> 02:30:21,010
I got lucky dice, bro.

2138
02:30:22,530 --> 02:30:24,050
Put me in, coach.

2139
02:30:26,590 --> 02:30:30,350
If I have to go to hell, I'm dragging you down with me.

2140
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:41,760
I don't need to fight them.

2141
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,620
Okay, and then we go...

2142
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:45,860
Up.

2143
02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:51,120
God, roll.

2144
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:52,120
Thank God.

2145
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:57,260
We technically go to the bench right now.

2146
02:30:57,400 --> 02:30:58,580
Let's just go to the bench first.

2147
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,540
I know deflect is very important.

2148
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:03,040
for this fight.

2149
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:10,530
All right, it's time.

2150
02:31:10,650 --> 02:31:11,430
Oh, there she is.

2151
02:31:11,490 --> 02:31:12,330
There's the ant.

2152
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:30,650
Uh...

2153
02:31:30,650 --> 02:31:32,290
Okay, it's not working.

2154
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:33,070
Okay.

2155
02:31:33,610 --> 02:31:33,950
Oh!

2156
02:31:35,090 --> 02:31:35,530
Oh.

2157
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:37,570
Oh, it's up.

2158
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:38,910
I thought this was her.

2159
02:31:44,530 --> 02:31:46,230
Alright, we're supposed to go up.

2160
02:31:46,910 --> 02:31:49,050
I was like, why is this she waking up?

2161
02:31:49,290 --> 02:31:49,570
Hello?

2162
02:31:50,110 --> 02:31:51,270
I played you a song.

2163
02:31:51,410 --> 02:31:52,550
Please wake up.

2164
02:32:00,210 --> 02:32:01,350
Oh, hey, that's nice.

2165
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:02,670
The boy didn't get him.

2166
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:07,560
Oh, that's annoying.

2167
02:32:08,060 --> 02:32:10,280
I mean, I guess you want to come along with me?

2168
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:14,540
Shit, okay, I'm gonna wait here.

2169
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:15,740
Don't worry, come over here.

2170
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:18,020
You're not coming on this trip.

2171
02:32:19,300 --> 02:32:20,500
There we go.

2172
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,630
What?

2173
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:26,470
What the fuck?

2174
02:32:29,210 --> 02:32:30,690
Are you serious?

2175
02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:33,650
Oh!

2176
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:41,430
There we go, I was like gonna- what the fuck is going on?

2177
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:47,060
All right, knock knock.

2178
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:53,220
Oh, I guess no knock knock.

2179
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:58,850
Oh, far fields.

2180
02:33:01,650 --> 02:33:03,110
I'm supposed to go down.

2181
02:33:08,850 --> 02:33:11,870
Oh my god, wait, there's a mama!

2182
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:23,300
How am I supposed to go?

2183
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:27,020
Guess up here?

2184
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:31,960
Oh my god, I'm so good.

2185
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:32,620
confused.

2186
02:33:34,460 --> 02:33:35,460
It's like you're so... Oh, wait.

2187
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:36,120
Nice.

2188
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:37,480
Free items.

2189
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:41,300
Alright, yoink.

2190
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:42,880
Let's take your shit.

2191
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:45,040
Free loot.

2192
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:48,380
He's been guarding his...

2193
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:52,160
He's been guarding his 401k for 20 years.

2194
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:53,600
Poor thing.

2195
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:03,620
That was his retirement fund.

2196
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:04,560
Yoink.

2197
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,320
My retirement fund now.

2198
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:10,220
What is this?

2199
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:15,960
Oh, it's just shells.

2200
02:34:18,120 --> 02:34:18,780
Oh, shit.

2201
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:23,680
It's the one jump that matters.

2202
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:25,680
Down, I'll go.

2203
02:34:26,820 --> 02:34:28,660
Yeah, he's dead so he can't retire now.

2204
02:34:28,820 --> 02:34:30,800
It's a shame that there was an accident.

2205
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:34,600
Such a shame.

2206
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:38,420
Oh my god.

2207
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:39,800
There's so many levers.

2208
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:46,480
I knew it.

2209
02:34:46,480 --> 02:34:47,740
I knew this was a secret.

2210
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:49,540
A secret tunnel.

2211
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:51,640
Oh.

2212
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:55,280
Oh, what?

2213
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:55,640
Oh.

2214
02:34:57,740 --> 02:34:58,600
Get out of here.

2215
02:34:58,720 --> 02:34:59,560
I know you're hiding.

2216
02:35:00,280 --> 02:35:01,220
Oh, what a shock.

2217
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,460
Discover it again so easily.

2218
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:05,880
Like a helpless little hatchling.

2219
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:11,340
If you're gonna make a sport of tracking me, I'll have to redouble my efforts at camouflage.

2220
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:28,540
all right good yeah oh there she goes screaming again oh no i was like bro where are you doing here how did she even get here can't even fly

2222
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:45,230
all right yeah how did she get here i have to fucking go through her head get this ability to do all that shit.

2223
02:35:50,740 --> 02:35:51,480
Where does this go?

2224
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,160
She and I are not the same.

2225
02:36:02,620 --> 02:36:03,760
Oh my god, this is so bad.

2226
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:04,920
This is actually so bad.

2227
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:06,260
Oh no.

2228
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:08,860
Are you serious?

2229
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:10,000
Okay, that's...

2230
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,380
He does it!

2231
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:11,960
Oh, goodbye!

2232
02:36:21,290 --> 02:36:24,030
Oh my god, to do all of that again!

2233
02:36:25,650 --> 02:36:28,190
I didn't think that void will be there!

2234
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:33,950
Oh my god, so far.

2235
02:36:34,330 --> 02:36:35,530
It's so far.

2236
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:37,750
That's the worst fight.

2237
02:36:38,010 --> 02:36:39,650
It's so fucking far.

2238
02:36:39,870 --> 02:36:41,110
There's a shortcut!

2239
02:36:44,090 --> 02:36:44,770
Like...

2240
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:48,650
A fucking curse.

2241
02:36:48,710 --> 02:36:51,050
There's a shortcut that I didn't happen to get.

2242
02:36:54,570 --> 02:36:56,430
There's always a shortcut.

2243
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:05,160
There's always a goddamn shortcut.

2244
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,660
Oh my god, I was so close.

2245
02:37:15,850 --> 02:37:17,530
I'm not dealing with a mama.

2246
02:37:18,490 --> 02:37:19,230
I'm leaving.

2247
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:28,540
You can have this place.

2248
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:34,580
As soon as shortcut opens that, but like how the fuck do I open that?

2249
02:37:40,630 --> 02:37:42,370
Okay, let's grab our shit first.

2250
02:37:43,770 --> 02:37:44,670
How do I get there?

2251
02:37:45,010 --> 02:37:45,810
Is this way?

2252
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:50,620
Um...

2253
02:37:50,680 --> 02:37:55,580
And that's, oh, fuck, I forgot how long I have to cross from here.

2254
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:01,120
Yeah, I'm not touching the ground.

2255
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:01,980
I'm too scared.

2256
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:09,620
Okay, so there's a bench here.

2257
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:21,240
Where does this, where is this taking me?

2258
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:23,980
Where, where is this taking me?

2259
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:29,520
What?

2260
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:31,060
Oh, there is a bench here.

2261
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:33,040
Who is this?

2262
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:34,020
Who is this guy?

2263
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:35,480
Hello?

2264
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:38,180
Ho ho!

2265
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:41,480
A nimble opponent appears at last at last.

2266
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:42,940
Maybe you're seeking challenges, sir.

2267
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:46,000
You choose a location less far field.

2268
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:49,760
Is there a rare chance I or any bug would come upon this distant cavern?

2269
02:38:50,460 --> 02:38:50,780
True.

2270
02:38:51,260 --> 02:38:59,300
Though, once discovered, could there be a perfect spot that giant bony body so distant from far looms else?

2271
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:00,220
Hello?

2272
02:39:00,420 --> 02:39:01,580
Here, fear severely.

2273
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:02,560
We can test our speed.

2274
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:04,320
in our sleek shells.

2275
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:05,640
Here we may race.

2276
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,340
You may be eager to step on the task, Challenger.

2277
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,560
Fulfill my wish.

2278
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:10,800
Let's discover it.

2279
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:11,260
No.

2280
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:16,780
I need to get my shit first before I fight you.

2281
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:19,860
Remember Sprint Master?

2282
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:21,060
I do not remember.

2283
02:39:23,960 --> 02:39:25,980
You're asking the wrong person.

2284
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:28,140
I absolutely do not remember.

2285
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:30,300
Whatever the fuck that is.

2286
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:34,300
All right, I'll fight him later.

2287
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:40,340
I need to grab my shit first guys I'm not fighting him with half my silk

2288
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:49,380
Where is it it's like right here or something there you go.

2289
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:55,820
I'll come back then all right Time to do some cardio

2290
02:39:59,230 --> 02:40:00,850
It's a race.

2291
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:02,090
Oh my god.

2292
02:40:02,290 --> 02:40:08,610
No, not the fuck I ride just fucking slap him just fight you.

2293
02:40:10,690 --> 02:40:11,910
You not see my legs?

2294
02:40:12,190 --> 02:40:13,710
Dita's legs are enough for running.

2295
02:40:13,890 --> 02:40:17,450
I could barely support my fucking head with these legs.

2296
02:40:23,070 --> 02:40:24,410
Alright, how does this go?

2297
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,670
Magnificent!

2298
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:32,150
May a mighty contest of shells commence!

2299
02:40:32,530 --> 02:40:33,910
But final no, Nimbabug.

2300
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:36,610
Have you ever run off course or desire a quick convene?

2301
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:37,390
Simply play.

2302
02:40:37,410 --> 02:40:48,690
what music you're able and my companion shall whisk you back to our starting line now the track calls us allow me a moment to assemble a course worthy to test our skills

2303
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:56,220
oh my god

2304
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:03,580
what the fuck

2305
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:11,000
Okay, this is not fair.

2306
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:13,800
This is not fair.

2307
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:15,560
It's like he knows this course or some shit.

2308
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:16,640
Like, he built it.

2309
02:41:16,820 --> 02:41:21,640
Like, oh my god, it's...

2310
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,660
It's not fair.

2311
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:27,940
It's like he built this course so he knows how to run this race.

2312
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:29,780
Okay.

2313
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:37,060
Bro, Bro can literally fly exactly!

2314
02:41:42,700 --> 02:41:44,500
Oh my god, I need to remember not to jump for that.

2315
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:48,160
Go, go, go, go, keep, go.

2316
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:55,620
Oh my god, it's so close.

2317
02:41:57,460 --> 02:41:58,700
It's actually so close.

2318
02:42:00,520 --> 02:42:01,320
Oh, we did it!

2319
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:03,160
We got the first race!

2320
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:05,020
Oh, I can hit him?

2321
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:06,660
Oh, I can.

2322
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:08,280
Oh, that's good to know.

2323
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:09,560
Oh, is this a V?

2324
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:10,720
Can it be?

2325
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:12,200
I shale so fast.

2326
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:13,840
Wonder if I loom.

2327
02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:16,480
A bug whose pace can match my own.

2328
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:20,000
Though I said simple course, we have proven it's matching more.

2329
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:23,720
Take this small reward, nimble bug, and remember well, I grant.

2330
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:24,860
That's just money.

2331
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:27,300
I thought...

2332
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:29,880
I thought I'd get a mess.

2333
02:42:31,480 --> 02:42:33,560
Wait, how many races does he make me do?

2334
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:37,180
do two

2335
02:42:40,850 --> 02:42:49,440
more okay two more well now that i know that i can slow him down makes it a lot easier that's freaking right

2336
02:42:55,590 --> 02:43:04,330
okay oh my god i don't know where to go it's up

2337
02:43:08,750 --> 02:43:09,830
We restart.

2338
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:12,310
We restart the race.

2339
02:43:16,910 --> 02:43:18,190
I am fucked up.

2340
02:43:18,310 --> 02:43:20,050
I didn't realize it does that.

2341
02:43:21,910 --> 02:43:22,510
Okay, this time.

2342
02:43:22,590 --> 02:43:23,030
This time.

2343
02:43:23,130 --> 02:43:23,990
I figured it out.

2344
02:43:35,090 --> 02:43:37,110
Okay, I like that I can beat him up.

2345
02:43:37,950 --> 02:43:39,910
That makes it a lot easier.

2346
02:43:44,610 --> 02:43:46,510
Yeah, that makes it a lot easier.

2347
02:43:47,750 --> 02:43:48,790
I ran out

2348
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:53,000
of...

2349
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:53,300
No!

2350
02:43:56,760 --> 02:43:58,900
I ran out of silk!

2351
02:44:04,460 --> 02:44:06,020
Okay, that's fine.

2352
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:07,040
It's sound...

2353
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:07,720
It's fixable.

2354
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:08,300
It's fixable.

2355
02:44:12,260 --> 02:44:13,760
It's fixable, guys.

2356
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:17,260
Oh my god, maybe it's not.

2357
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:20,200
Guys, this might not be fixable, guys.

2358
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:21,340
I don't know.

2359
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:28,180
Oh my god, he's so fucking fast.

2360
02:44:28,700 --> 02:44:29,280
He's so...

2361
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:34,960
Guys, this might not be fixable, guys!

2362
02:44:35,380 --> 02:44:36,780
Guys, it's not fixable!

2363
02:44:40,580 --> 02:44:42,320
It's so over.

2364
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:46,200
It's...

2365
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:48,460
Oh my god.

2366
02:44:49,240 --> 02:44:51,500
The things I do for a mass.

2367
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:53,880
Guys, it was not fixable.

2368
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:57,260
It was not I

2369
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:06,420
need to just use my harpoon I know Okay

2370
02:45:13,320 --> 02:45:22,540
Okay Oh god

2371
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:27,900
There you go

2372
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:33,420
Okay, okay.

2373
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:34,900
It's fine.

2374
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:35,560
No!

2375
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:44,740
I feel like I need more silk for this.

2376
02:45:45,080 --> 02:45:46,560
I'm fucking getting more silk.

2377
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:47,840
I'm getting more silk.

2378
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:51,120
It's not worth it.

2379
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:55,020
Oh my god, it's so far too.

2380
02:45:55,380 --> 02:45:59,020
I can't even, oh my god, it's so far.

2381
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:10,320
Also, I just realized, um, I just realized I forgot to like turn on the jumping thing but i'm too lazy to turn it on right now oh

2382
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:21,220
my god what the fuck i wasn't running

2383
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:37,940
okay i need to make sure not to double jump i had to double jump that though like like there was no other way i wouldn't have made it i didn't have that momentum

2384
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:57,420
I missed the jump.

2385
02:46:58,140 --> 02:46:59,500
I missed the jump.

2386
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:03,720
Oh, like, I don't know if I can make it to that third race.

2387
02:47:04,220 --> 02:47:06,540
I was doing so well, too.

2388
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:09,880
Apparently, charms don't work in the races.

2389
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:18,010
Okay.

2390
02:47:22,290 --> 02:47:23,150
Oh, gosh.

2391
02:47:28,350 --> 02:47:57,580
okay because I would use the I would use the charm if I could all right Jesus Christ he's so close he's like literally right on my right but he's right beside me isn't he he's right behind me isn't he

2392
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:08,220
oh my god he's right there oh my god oh my god i accidentally

2393
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:31,520
oh my god please please please yes i did it all right we got a third race race down by three truly incredible was it a course did i lose focus or you suddenly the bug i waited so long for Her is such skill that my wish could.

2394
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:32,640
Alas, be granted.

2395
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:35,840
Another reward must be given for your speed.

2396
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:36,620
Nemo bug.

2397
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,200
One deserved and full.

2398
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:42,240
What if I just fucking get a crowbar and hit it and just whack his knees?

2399
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:44,360
It shall be improved.

2400
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:45,140
Yes, yes.

2401
02:48:45,380 --> 02:48:46,840
The truest test is to come.

2402
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:49,560
We shall fly fast together once more.

2403
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:53,880
Our last race was grand, yes?

2404
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:55,760
But I see now I said to a mile.

2405
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:57,940
A chance for one as friendly as yours.

2406
02:48:58,400 --> 02:48:59,360
I prepared only to race.

2407
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:19,020
but your eye bring destiny and you my wishmen finally be granted the barriers of speed broke and wide are you prepared nimble bug the time is upon us the final test for the swift and spray okay sad this is not fair he built the course himself so he knows all the shortcuts

2408
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:30,200
yeah i got it

2409
02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:41,020
like i don't He's just flying over the course!

2410
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:44,000
Like, what the fuck do I do?

2411
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:50,560
He's cheating!

2412
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:55,160
He's literally cheating!

2413
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:58,740
No!

2414
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:20,700
I ran out of self Oh my god I had I just had to whack him I just had to How am I cheating?

2415
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:35,960
Oh Just because I accidentally hit him with my stick Did you not see that relay voice Where that girl was doing the relay Accidentally hit that girl in the back of the head With her baton It's just like that It's all just an accident

2416
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:42,100
Like, how is that my...

2417
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:43,240
Oh, my God.

2418
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:44,860
Accident.

2419
02:50:45,280 --> 02:50:46,220
Oh, hello, Tata.

2420
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:49,260
Ah, stop here.

2421
02:50:52,560 --> 02:50:53,620
There you go.

2422
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:54,740
We do it again.

2423
02:50:56,260 --> 02:50:57,960
She said it was an accident.

2424
02:50:58,100 --> 02:51:00,800
If she could say it's an accident.

2425
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:04,700
Oh, sorry.

2426
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:06,660
Accidentally hit him.

2427
02:51:07,720 --> 02:51:10,500
I'm so I'm so silly

2428
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:20,580
Like I keep I just ran out of silk.

2429
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,820
I literally I just ran out of silk.

2430
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:25,840
I literally can't do it

2431
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:42,760
Okay, I just can't grapple twice Oh, I can pogo him It's too much, it's just too much boo-going.

2432
02:51:46,750 --> 02:51:48,930
Get out of here.

2433
02:51:50,290 --> 02:51:50,590
Yeah.

2434
02:51:55,730 --> 02:51:57,390
Oh my god, okay.

2435
02:51:58,130 --> 02:51:59,230
I'll figure it out.

2436
02:52:00,350 --> 02:52:00,710
No!

2437
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:06,240
Okay.

2438
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:12,180
Okay, okay.

2439
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:13,220
Okay, okay.

2440
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:14,760
This time.

2441
02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:15,940
This time.

2442
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:18,880
I figured it out this time.

2443
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:27,080
It's just a lack of silk.

2444
02:52:27,320 --> 02:52:28,160
That's really it.

2445
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:30,680
I think if I...

2446
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:36,620
If I had a full silk, it definitely would be a lot easier.

2447
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:39,520
Okay.

2448
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:54,720
No, I can pogo.

2449
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:55,760
I can pogo.

2450
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:00,480
I just, I'm trying to do like, I'm trying to skip it with my needle.

2451
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:02,660
It was so sad.

2452
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:07,260
It was so sad.

2453
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:09,840
Why can't he give me a full set of silk?

2454
02:53:10,320 --> 02:53:13,280
Why does it just give me this tiny ass little nub?

2455
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:18,960
Okay.

2456
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:22,920
Okay.

2457
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:25,500
Oh my god.

2458
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:31,310
It's not a part!

2459
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:32,710
It's just that fight!

2460
02:53:33,150 --> 02:53:35,190
I keep fucking that fight up!

2461
02:53:36,030 --> 02:53:37,650
I don't know why!

2462
02:53:40,930 --> 02:53:42,250
All right.

2463
02:53:45,490 --> 02:53:46,710
I almost got it.

2464
02:53:47,190 --> 02:53:48,110
I could feel it.

2465
02:53:48,990 --> 02:53:49,710
This is it.

2466
02:53:49,730 --> 02:53:50,130
This is it.

2467
02:53:54,810 --> 02:53:54,810
This is it.

2468
02:53:55,550 --> 02:53:55,910
This is it.

2469
02:53:56,150 --> 02:53:56,370
This is it.

2470
02:53:57,270 --> 02:53:59,050
This is my character arc right here.

2471
02:54:00,370 --> 02:54:01,910
I've downloaded it.

2472
02:54:04,330 --> 02:54:05,110
Here we go.

2473
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:06,850
Watch this.

2474
02:54:08,910 --> 02:54:09,990
Okay, this part is...

2475
02:54:09,990 --> 02:54:11,450
I'm just so slow in this area.

2476
02:54:13,650 --> 02:54:15,030
I don't know what to do.

2477
02:54:15,410 --> 02:54:16,350
To be faster.

2478
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:26,120
Okay.

2479
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:34,300
Okay, nice.

2480
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:35,520
Oh.

2481
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:38,580
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

2482
02:54:39,760 --> 02:54:41,200
Alright, alright, alright.

2483
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:43,060
Accidentally jumped there, but that's okay.

2484
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:43,880
It's salvageable.

2485
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:47,440
Oh my god.

2486
02:54:47,700 --> 02:54:48,140
Oh!

2487
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:48,820
No!

2488
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:49,380
No!

2489
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:53,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2490
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:56,580
I know I'm faster!

2491
02:54:56,780 --> 02:54:57,140
Yes!

2492
02:54:57,640 --> 02:54:59,460
Oh, I did it!

2493
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:01,600
I did it!

2494
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:02,720
Oh, that was close.

2495
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:03,740
That was so close.

2496
02:55:04,120 --> 02:55:05,060
Oh, he done it.

2497
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:06,300
Oh, hoof.

2498
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:09,080
Never will I believe the shell so fast in all of our loom.

2499
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:10,300
Wonders of wonders.

2500
02:55:10,780 --> 02:55:11,660
I saved it.

2501
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:13,860
Capricorn, Nimblebug, fulfilled my race.

2502
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:17,460
Wish, seeing my pace match, I mean, my limits broken wide.

2503
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:18,340
Yay!

2504
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:20,080
Wish granted.

2505
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:22,360
I got the mask.

2506
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:26,640
Wait, before you depart, your exceptional skills required.

2507
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:28,160
equally fine reward.

2508
02:55:28,780 --> 02:55:30,420
The shodding is sorry of ancient masochists yours.

2509
02:55:30,820 --> 02:55:34,420
Take it and cherish it and know you shall forever have my thanks.

2510
02:55:34,920 --> 02:55:35,300
Yay!

2511
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:38,900
I just need one more mask and I get another HP.

2512
02:55:39,220 --> 02:55:39,420
Goodbye.

2513
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:41,680
I hope we never meet again.

2514
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:45,020
I hope you break your legs.

2515
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:47,980
Okay, but what does that last race get me?

2516
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:50,180
Like, is it just exposure?

2517
02:55:50,700 --> 02:55:54,300
Like, I leave.

2518
02:56:01,720 --> 02:56:04,540
Yeah, but does it actually get me anything?

2519
02:56:04,860 --> 02:56:05,460
Oh, a momentum?

2520
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:06,640
Fuck that shit.

2521
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:10,180
I don't need him from... I don't even remember anything from him.

2522
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:13,920
A fun medal.

2523
02:56:15,460 --> 02:56:15,860
It's fine.

2524
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:17,420
I don't need to remember him.

2525
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:21,500
In fact, I hope I never see him again.

2526
02:56:29,530 --> 02:56:30,910
Is it worth killing, is this?

2527
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:32,570
I'm just like thinking.

2528
02:56:38,490 --> 02:56:39,310
Are you serious?

2529
02:56:39,690 --> 02:56:40,170
Please.

2530
02:56:40,570 --> 02:56:40,950
Oh my god.

2531
02:56:40,970 --> 02:56:41,670
At least I killed him.

2532
02:56:41,770 --> 02:56:42,490
At least I killed him.

2533
02:56:42,670 --> 02:56:43,610
He can't hurt me no more.

2534
02:56:44,630 --> 02:56:45,350
It's fine.

2535
02:56:45,750 --> 02:56:46,810
I'll kill the source.

2536
02:56:49,650 --> 02:56:50,110
It's okay.

2537
02:56:50,250 --> 02:56:51,610
I killed the source.

2538
02:57:01,220 --> 02:57:01,640
Alright.

2539
02:57:01,880 --> 02:57:04,480
He can't have no special powers anymore.

2540
02:57:11,770 --> 02:57:11,810
Alright.

2541
02:57:14,010 --> 02:57:14,530
Okay.

2542
02:57:15,210 --> 02:57:15,690
Now.

2543
02:57:16,090 --> 02:57:16,550
Alright.

2544
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:27,480
Parkour.

2545
02:57:28,360 --> 02:57:30,300
See, the source is gone.

2546
02:57:30,880 --> 02:57:32,160
Can't be special no more.

2547
02:57:32,720 --> 02:57:33,480
That's fucking right.

2548
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:36,780
You're not special anymore.

2549
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:40,280
No more void for you.

2550
02:57:42,220 --> 02:57:42,400
What?

2551
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:45,420
Excuse me.

2552
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:49,000
How did that happen?

2553
02:57:50,380 --> 02:57:53,040
But I'll kill the source.

2554
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:57,420
Wait a minute.

2555
02:57:58,320 --> 02:58:01,680
make any sense about that.

2556
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:05,000
But I've killed the source.

2557
02:58:07,720 --> 02:58:09,680
Oh, they can randomly become possessed?

2558
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:10,580
What the fuck?

2559
02:58:11,420 --> 02:58:12,420
And what's the point?

2560
02:58:13,640 --> 02:58:14,600
Is this a shortcut?

2561
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:16,100
Okay, now I got the shortcut.

2562
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:17,500
Wait, did it open?

2563
02:58:17,820 --> 02:58:18,520
Okay, it did.

2564
02:58:19,880 --> 02:58:21,340
He had leftovers.

2565
02:58:25,040 --> 02:58:27,260
Soon, this is where she lives.

2566
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:30,540
Okay, but what's up top then?

2567
02:58:32,220 --> 02:58:32,500
Oh.

2568
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:35,200
Oh, for a bench.

2569
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:35,760
Oh, okay.

2570
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:37,840
I was gonna save.

2571
02:58:40,420 --> 02:58:41,800
What lies on the top?

2572
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:45,180
I have to deflect on, right?

2573
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:45,860
Yeah, I do.

2574
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:50,620
Memory lock it to the right?

2575
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:52,580
Or like this right?

2576
02:58:58,370 --> 02:58:59,710
Oh, there it is.

2577
02:59:01,770 --> 02:59:02,350
Him?

2578
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:05,980
Oh my god!

2579
02:59:06,300 --> 02:59:06,920
Oh, it's my god!

2580
02:59:08,040 --> 02:59:09,040
I did not expect that.

2581
02:59:11,800 --> 02:59:13,320
I did not expect that either.

2582
02:59:14,240 --> 02:59:15,020
Fine, I got bread.

2583
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:21,120
Jesus Christ.

2584
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:23,740
He did so much fucking damage.

2585
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:26,260
Alright, memory lock it.

2586
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,900
But I'm fast as fuck, boy.

2587
02:59:29,880 --> 02:59:30,900
Everything over here?

2588
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:33,780
No.

2589
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:34,740
It's just normal.

2590
02:59:35,980 --> 02:59:37,780
Oh, there might be something up here.

2591
02:59:40,220 --> 02:59:41,020
I knew it.

2592
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:46,400
I knew he was gonna fucking block me there.

2593
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:49,120
Okay, never mind, there is nothing.

2594
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:53,420
He was like, yeah, there is something here, it's me.

2595
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:57,300
Pain is... Oh, there she is.

2596
02:59:58,900 --> 02:59:59,940
Why are you so sad?

2597
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:03,680
It's because you're not beautiful anymore and you're old.

2598
03:00:09,740 --> 03:00:11,300
For the mother.

2599
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:14,560
Remember my children.

2600
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:15,700
Wow!

2601
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:17,100
Toki!

2602
03:00:18,300 --> 03:00:18,600
Wow!

2603
03:00:21,740 --> 03:00:23,280
Oh, just because you're old?

2604
03:00:23,980 --> 03:00:24,660
Don't worry.

2605
03:00:24,940 --> 03:00:26,740
Someone out there would like hugs.

2606
03:00:28,020 --> 03:00:29,100
Yeah, my name.

2607
03:00:29,220 --> 03:00:31,420
Hell, be spring, ruined by a censer.

2608
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:33,780
You're writing harsh, your final fate.

2609
03:00:34,180 --> 03:00:35,520
Empower, you come seeking.

2610
03:00:35,800 --> 03:00:36,760
Mine is faded.

2611
03:00:37,440 --> 03:00:38,300
Great one.

2612
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:39,720

2614
03:01:16,480 --> 03:01:20,300
There's a lot of fishes in the sea that would tap a hag.

2615
03:01:26,050 --> 03:01:27,190
Yeah, I heard she's like super hard.

2616
03:01:27,410 --> 03:01:28,930
That's why I left her her fucking last.

2617
03:01:32,950 --> 03:01:34,070
Alright, here we go.

2618
03:01:35,210 --> 03:01:38,730
I've also like seen a bit of like the fight for her.

2619
03:01:39,310 --> 03:01:41,150

Okay, never mind.

I need to remember, I need to know when she does that.

2630
03:03:17,690 --> 03:03:18,710
Are you serious?

2631
03:03:18,830 --> 03:03:19,990
Are you fucking kidding me?

2632
03:03:20,010 --> 03:03:20,230
Okay.

2633
03:03:24,090 --> 03:03:52,940
can you like remember yourself like less uh less harder can you like alter your memories so that you're less difficult to fight because it's literally her memory why did i don't even know this if she's just embellishing her own memory like how is she actually that hot back then?

2634
03:03:53,160 --> 03:03:53,840
I don't know that.

2635
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:55,380
It's her own fucking memory.

2636
03:03:56,100 --> 03:03:57,360
She can alter it.

2637
03:03:58,560 --> 03:04:00,500
Yeah, can you remember yourself a few years older?

2638
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:02,660
Like, maybe like a hundred years old?

2639
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:08,100
Yeah, can't gaslight her to thinking she was fucking trash?

2640
03:04:10,980 --> 03:04:14,240
Oh my god, I'm gonna fight your goddamn children again.

2641
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:18,260
Oh yeah, fuck this.

2642
03:04:18,780 --> 03:04:20,040
I'm taking you to the fire.

2643
03:04:20,580 --> 03:04:21,440
I can't be bothered.

2644
03:04:21,700 --> 03:04:22,380
Okay.

2645
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:23,080
You

2646
03:04:29,050 --> 03:04:32,130
guys are so annoying.

2647
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:37,220
Get back in here.

2648
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:38,980
I think it's over, dragoons.

2649
03:04:39,080 --> 03:04:40,060
Get back in here.

2650
03:04:42,160 --> 03:04:43,080
There we go.

2651
03:04:49,070 --> 03:04:49,870
Oh, I got four?

2652
03:04:51,050 --> 03:04:52,370
By now, I know.

2653
03:04:57,420 --> 03:04:57,800
Friend.

2654
03:05:00,420 --> 03:05:00,900
Jesus.

2655
03:05:04,520 --> 03:05:05,320
Oh, my God.

2656
03:05:05,500 --> 03:05:06,220
What do I...

2657
03:05:06,220 --> 03:05:06,460
Okay.

2658
03:05:09,690 --> 03:05:10,570
Oh, my God.

2659
03:05:10,750 --> 03:05:11,370
Friend.

2660
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:16,540
I don't know how to dodge it.

2661
03:05:17,770 --> 03:05:19,530
Are you kidding me?

2662
03:05:20,990 --> 03:05:21,530
Ah!

2663
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:23,970
I need to know the timing for the deflect.

2664
03:05:26,110 --> 03:05:27,690
I don't know the timing for the deflect.

2665
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:37,460
Yeah, I need to figure out the timing.

2666
03:05:38,020 --> 03:05:39,060
I mistimed it.

2667
03:05:40,820 --> 03:05:42,260
Just get 10 masks, bro.

2668
03:05:42,260 --> 03:05:48,520
I can strike...

2669
03:05:48,520 --> 03:05:49,620
Oh, I can strike it?

2670
03:05:50,160 --> 03:05:52,200
Okay, now that I know that I can strike it.

2671
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:54,820
Makes it a little easier.

2672
03:06:03,350 --> 03:06:03,770
Alright.

2673
03:06:05,710 --> 03:06:07,350
Just get all the upgrades, bro.

2674
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:08,330
It's just that easy.

2675
03:06:10,710 --> 03:06:11,710
Okay, I'm just...

2676
03:06:11,710 --> 03:06:15,530
I got just so distracted because there's so many things on my screen.

2677
03:06:15,550 --> 03:06:16,110
Green!

2678
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:27,080
Okay, I will say that was so frustrating to fight.

2679
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
It's because you're red and they're red!

2680
03:06:34,490 --> 03:06:35,990
Oh my god.

2681
03:06:41,960 --> 03:06:43,980
Alright, let's go.

2682
03:06:45,790 --> 03:06:46,360
Let's go.

2683
03:06:53,450 --> 03:06:54,030
Alright.

2684
03:06:54,990 --> 03:06:57,630
Oh my god, I should have to, I'm gonna try and focus for this.

2685
03:06:57,650 --> 03:06:57,890
this.

2686
03:07:05,010 --> 03:07:05,570
Are you serious?

2687
03:07:05,750 --> 03:07:07,050
Okay, that's five.

2688
03:07:07,850 --> 03:07:08,130
Friend.

2689
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:14,640
Okay, I got the deflect.

2690
03:07:16,520 --> 03:07:17,060
Are you?

2691
03:07:17,400 --> 03:07:17,620
How?

2692
03:07:17,820 --> 03:07:18,940
What is your rage?

2693
03:07:25,740 --> 03:07:27,120
Oh my, it's not there.

2694
03:07:28,300 --> 03:07:31,880
Oh, I hate you.

2695
03:07:32,080 --> 03:07:33,040
I hate you.

2696
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:33,940
Friend.

2697
03:07:36,240 --> 03:07:37,900
Her rage is nearly yes.

2698
03:07:41,690 --> 03:07:44,310
Oh my god, you're such a fucker

2699
03:07:55,540 --> 03:08:02,460
Oh my god, I hate you I need to learn to deflect it instead of jumping

2700
03:08:06,980 --> 03:08:15,360
I need to learn to Oh my god, I I jumped instead of reflecting I got punished Alright

2701
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:22,100
What a beautiful dog

2702
03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:27,180
Don't rip that heart out of your body.

2703
03:08:28,620 --> 03:08:29,260
Do I...

2704
03:08:29,260 --> 03:08:31,880
Does it take my shells when I'm actually in this dream?

2705
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,600
Or does it, like, reset after I die?

2706
03:08:37,740 --> 03:08:38,360
Yeah, I'm trying...

2707
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:40,440
I keep jumping instead of hitting it.

2708
03:08:42,040 --> 03:08:42,980
Oh, it doesn't take my shell?

2709
03:08:43,340 --> 03:08:45,140
Oh, okay, so I can actually spam this.

2710
03:08:46,900 --> 03:08:47,420
That's good.

2711
03:08:48,620 --> 03:09:00,740
The only issue that I don't like about this is that I literally it's so hard to see the enemy because you're red and they're red it's it's actually it's so confusing

2712
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:08,740

2713
03:09:11,800 --> 03:09:21,470

03:09:40,450 --> 03:09:41,390
Jam time!

2717
03:09:44,410 --> 03:09:45,930
That's not fair.

2718
03:09:52,240 --> 03:09:53,400
Oh my god.

2719
03:09:57,940 --> 03:09:58,680

She, like, threw me off.

2741
03:12:21,440 --> 03:12:22,180
You don't understand.

2742
03:12:22,860 --> 03:12:23,020
Oh.

2743
03:12:23,940 --> 03:12:26,100

03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:32,980
I need to get used to hitting that.

2746
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:34,960
I'm not hitting it.

2747
03:12:37,380 --> 03:12:37,900
Friend.

2748
03:12:44,620 --> 03:12:44,920
Okay.

2751
03:12:57,240 --> 03:12:57,960
There we go.

2752
03:12:59,620 --> 03:13:02,540
I was gonna say, how did I get to a second phase?

2753
03:13:07,850 --> 03:13:08,370
Okay.

2754
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:13,940
I'm trying to like...

2755
03:13:17,740 --> 03:13:20,460

03:14:01,400 --> 03:14:02,360
I got it in time.

2766
03:14:08,720 --> 03:14:09,280
Okay.

2767
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:12,280
No, you fucker!

2768
03:14:13,240 --> 03:14:14,280
You fucker!

2770
03:14:24,710 --> 03:14:25,530
We're so close!

2771
03:14:26,090 --> 03:14:27,070
We're so close!

2772
03:14:27,290 --> 03:14:28,290
I got the pattern!

2773
03:14:28,930 --> 03:14:29,950
I got the pattern!

2774
03:14:31,490 --> 03:14:32,230
I got hit!

2775
03:14:32,410 --> 03:14:33,130
I get hit!

2776
03:14:39,530 --> 03:14:40,550
It's a stupid...

2777
03:14:40,550 --> 03:14:42,690
Is there a stupid little saws?

2778
03:14:43,410 --> 03:14:43,830
I should have...

2779
03:14:43,830 --> 03:14:45,750
I should throw my own bone saws, honestly.

2780
03:14:45,990 --> 03:14:46,290
You know...

2781
03:14:46,290 --> 03:14:46,550
Oh my god.

2782
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:47,810
I should have brought my bone saw.

2783
03:14:48,890 --> 03:14:49,330
I...

2784
03:14:49,330 --> 03:14:50,910
I should have thrown my own bone saw.

2785
03:14:51,370 --> 03:14:54,350
If she's gonna throw bone saws, I'll throw my own bone saw.

2786
03:15:06,930 --> 03:15:09,970
Alright, if we don't do it for this try, I'm getting out that bone saw.

2787
03:15:14,590 --> 03:15:19,110
I'll fucking bring that Oh my

03:15:32,360 --> 03:15:33,740
These guys are so fucking...

2792
03:15:34,820 --> 03:15:36,280
They're just so tanky!

2793
03:15:39,720 --> 03:15:40,540
That's it.

2794
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:41,880
Get over here.

2795
03:15:43,120 --> 03:15:44,100
I'll believe.

2796
03:15:44,720 --> 03:15:46,000
Get over here.

2797
03:15:46,480 --> 03:15:47,120
Friends.

2798
03:15:48,300 --> 03:15:49,720
Alright, it's time.

2799
03:15:53,820 --> 03:15:55,300
Alright, get those free shots in.

2800
03:15:55,400 --> 03:15:55,980
She's too busy.

2801
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:56,580
Dancing.

2802
03:15:59,800 --> 03:16:01,640
I need to learn to parry that shit.

2803
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:04,340
I...

2804
03:16:06,660 --> 03:16:07,300
Okay.

2805
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:09,220
My bad.

2806
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:10,520
Okay.

2807
03:16:10,840 --> 03:16:11,300
I'm focused.

2808
03:16:11,620 --> 03:16:11,940
No!

2809
03:16:12,240 --> 03:16:13,620
I still don't parry it!

2810
03:16:15,940 --> 03:16:16,260
Okay.

2811
03:16:17,640 --> 03:16:18,860
I don't!

2812
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:25,680
That's it.

2813
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:27,320
I'm freeing the bones up.

2814
03:16:27,760 --> 03:16:29,160
I was not focused.

2815
03:16:30,140 --> 03:16:32,320
But it changes here.

2816
03:16:33,420 --> 03:16:35,100
I'm grabbing the bone saw.

2817
03:16:37,660 --> 03:16:40,340
This time it'll be different.

2818
03:16:44,380 --> 03:16:45,360
Wait, this is...

2819
03:16:45,880 --> 03:16:46,040
Oops.

2820
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:46,740
Oh, it's...

2821
03:16:46,740 --> 03:16:48,780
I mean, it's almost big.

2822
03:16:55,120 --> 03:16:57,560
She messed with the wrong bug.

2823
03:16:57,940 --> 03:16:59,400
It's bone saw time.

2824
03:17:04,810 --> 03:17:05,630
Alright.

2825
03:17:08,370 --> 03:17:09,450
I'm ready.

2826
03:17:16,890 --> 03:17:18,460
Alright, this time I'm focused.

2827
03:17:18,760 --> 03:17:19,200
For real.

2828
03:17:21,540 --> 03:17:22,620
For real.

2829
03:17:24,260 --> 03:17:25,380
No more brute force.

2830
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:28,500
The sauce are coming out.

2831
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:41,700
Alright, here we go.

2832
03:17:54,460 --> 03:17:55,340
Jesus Christ.

2833
03:17:57,200 --> 03:17:58,280
I was so used to the car.

2834
03:17:58,300 --> 03:18:01,360
Like, the cogs doing all the work.

2835
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:03,440
For this fight.

2836
03:18:11,910 --> 03:18:12,590
Jesus.

2837
03:18:14,090 --> 03:18:15,110
Okay, I...

2838
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:18,910
Both...

2839
03:18:18,910 --> 03:18:21,650
Saws might not be good against these guys.

2840
03:18:24,410 --> 03:18:26,890
Guys, I feel like maybe...

2841
03:18:31,130 --> 03:18:33,870
They're very good against maybe, like, the...

2842
03:18:33,890 --> 03:18:38,370
boss but not these guys not the least guys all

2843
03:18:42,140 --> 03:19:10,840

2844
03:19:10,840 --> 03:19:12,520
That should not have hit me.

2845
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:14,980
Okay, I used- guys, I used up my bone saw.

2846
03:19:15,140 --> 03:19:15,420
I don't know.

2847
03:19:15,940 --> 03:19:17,480
I didn't think this through.

2848
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:23,280
I might have accidentally used it all up.

2849
03:19:31,700 --> 03:19:34,020
I might have accidentally not think this through.

2850
03:19:40,730 --> 03:19:41,170
Alright.

2851
03:19:46,230 --> 03:19:46,990
There you go.

2852
03:19:48,410 --> 03:19:49,290
What the fuck?

2853
03:19:49,730 --> 03:19:51,050
Are you serious?

2854
03:19:53,670 --> 03:19:55,650
There you go.

2855
03:19:56,770 --> 03:19:58,690
Are you- oh my god, I didn't think she would.

2856
03:20:00,310 --> 03:20:01,270
The double hit.

2857
03:20:02,030 --> 03:20:02,550
God damn.

2858
03:20:04,110 --> 03:20:05,570
Not the double hit.

2859
03:20:10,760 --> 03:20:11,700
Get out of here!

2860
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:18,020
Hit.

2861
03:20:21,140 --> 03:20:23,040
Oh my god, you're stupid.

2862
03:20:24,780 --> 03:20:25,400
Oh no.

2863
03:20:26,300 --> 03:20:50,900

2864
03:20:57,740 --> 03:21:12,780

2865
03:21:12,960 --> 03:21:19,160
I oh she fucked the she fucking it got me She swapped up her pattern.

2866
03:21:19,460 --> 03:21:25,760
She switched it up What if you run infinite sobbing?

2867
03:21:30,280 --> 03:21:32,960
She swatched she switched it up

2868
03:21:37,620 --> 03:21:46,400
All right I didn't know cog, the cog bugs, the cog bugs was actually really good for this part though.

2869
03:21:46,920 --> 03:21:48,400
I don't know about shit.

2870
03:21:48,780 --> 03:21:50,540
I feel like I just swapped it back.

2871
03:21:53,800 --> 03:21:55,980
That's for that particular section.

2872
03:21:56,800 --> 03:21:59,140
Wait, oh my god, the fucking snipe.

2873
03:22:04,070 --> 03:22:06,750
Oh my god, he's so far up in the sky.

2874
03:22:16,220 --> 03:22:18,060
That's not fair, that should have hit.

2875
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:25,440
That should have counted as the deflex skill.

2876
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:35,920
Oh my god, his badass body touched me.

2877
03:22:39,020 --> 03:22:40,100
There we go.

2878
03:22:42,340 --> 03:22:45,220
Alright, I wait, and then I do this.

2879
03:22:45,580 --> 03:22:46,260
Bonesaw!

2880
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:47,940

That's unlucky.

2889
03:23:43,590 --> 03:23:44,030
Yeah.

2890
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:45,190
There you go.

2891
03:23:54,520 --> 03:23:56,260
Oh my god, she comboed me.

2892
03:24:00,020 --> 03:24:01,380
She's so smart.

2893
03:24:01,980 --> 03:24:05,360
It's like she's the queen of this queen or something.

2894
03:24:15,430 --> 03:24:15,750
Okay.

2895
03:24:16,150 --> 03:24:16,590
I'm locked.

2896
03:24:16,710 --> 03:24:17,830
I'm trying to lock in right now.

2897
03:24:20,030 --> 03:24:22,150
Okay, we have one more lay.

2898
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:27,280
Oh my god.

2899
03:24:28,300 --> 03:24:29,480
It's that move.

2900
03:24:29,660 --> 03:24:30,720
That fucks with me the most.

2901
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:32,160
Ow!

2902
03:24:33,320 --> 03:24:34,700
I shouldn't have done that.

2903
03:24:36,380 --> 03:24:36,760
Oh!

2904
03:24:38,220 --> 03:24:40,180
Alright, we're swapping the sauce.

2905
03:24:41,880 --> 03:24:44,820
Guys, the sauce might not be it.

2906
03:24:44,860 --> 03:24:46,280
It might not be the strat.

2907
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:49,960
I'm just gonna use the bug.

2908
03:24:50,300 --> 03:24:51,200
The cog bug.

2909
03:24:51,360 --> 03:24:53,480
just to clean up in the beginning.

2910
03:24:58,120 --> 03:24:59,460
Uh, what do you mean infinite?

2911
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:01,760
God, the cog flies.

2912
03:25:03,720 --> 03:25:04,680
No more.

2913
03:25:05,700 --> 03:25:07,780
No more saws.

2914
03:25:09,660 --> 03:25:15,480
I'm just gonna use this to get rid of the, to get rid of the bugs in the, in the beginning, though.

2915
03:25:20,270 --> 03:25:21,690
Oh, wait, I didn't want to talk to you.

2916
03:25:22,130 --> 03:25:23,310
I want to kill you.

2917
03:25:24,030 --> 03:25:24,170
Oh.

2918
03:25:40,550 --> 03:25:44,170
I could use Harpoon more, you're right.

2919
03:25:50,280 --> 03:25:52,280
I feel like distance is not the problem.

2920
03:25:52,700 --> 03:25:56,040
It's literally sometimes she like fucking swaps up her pattern.

2921
03:25:58,260 --> 03:25:59,640
That messes with me.

2922
03:26:01,900 --> 03:26:03,540
Her pattern sometimes messes with me.

2923
03:26:05,100 --> 03:26:08,800
Oh Yeah, no, this is a lot faster.

2924
03:26:09,600 --> 03:26:13,140

This time.

2976
03:30:01,810 --> 03:30:02,290
This time.

2977
03:30:02,830 --> 03:30:03,430
No more greed.

03:30:03,590 --> 03:30:04,210
No more greed.

2979
03:30:04,930 --> 03:30:05,390

I kept running into her ass.

2983
03:30:15,090 --> 03:30:16,410
I can't help it.

2984
03:30:17,810 --> 03:30:18,910
This is how it's been a pattern.

2985
03:30:19,310 --> 03:30:19,790
Every time.

2986
03:30:19,950 --> 03:30:21,190
Every time they got the booty.

2987
03:30:21,990 --> 03:30:22,830
It can't resist.

2988
03:30:24,370 --> 03:30:24,910
She do be.

2989
03:30:24,990 --> 03:30:26,270
She do be had the booty.

2990
03:30:27,970 --> 03:30:29,450
No more greed for real.

2991
03:30:31,270 --> 03:30:32,010
Clean up crew.

03:30:37,050 --> 03:30:38,930
Can you really blame me?

2993
03:30:40,990 --> 03:30:42,910
She knows she has it, too.

2994
03:30:43,650 --> 03:30:44,910
She knows she's got it.

2995
03:30:50,340 --> 03:30:50,680
Okay.

2996
03:30:53,740 --> 03:30:55,140

3001
03:31:07,650 --> 03:31:08,450

03:31:14,400 --> 03:31:15,560
Ah, fucking course.

3003
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:21,100

3013
03:32:39,540 --> 03:32:41,300
I don't deflect.

3014
03:32:41,680 --> 03:32:43,720
That's like my hubris right now.

3015
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:45,900
I keep forgetting to deflect.

3016
03:32:46,980 --> 03:32:49,840
I just jump instead because I feel like it'd be easy.

3017
03:32:49,920 --> 03:32:50,680
But it's not easier.

3018
03:32:50,980 --> 03:32:51,780
It's not easier.

3019
03:32:56,400 --> 03:32:59,620
It's not easier, but I can't help it.

3020
03:33:08,890 --> 03:33:10,010
All right, this is fine.

3021
03:33:10,390 --> 03:33:10,990
This is fine.

3022
03:33:11,630 --> 03:33:12,230
This is fine.

3023
03:33:12,930 --> 03:33:13,470
This is fine.

3024
03:33:14,690 --> 03:33:16,430
I'm locked in.

3025
03:33:16,790 --> 03:33:18,430
I'm so locked in.

3026
03:33:23,930 --> 03:33:24,610
All right.

3027
03:33:26,750 --> 03:33:27,230
Full focus.

3028
03:33:27,510 --> 03:33:27,810
Full focus.

3029
03:33:29,890 --> 03:33:31,390
Okay, why did you throw that?

3030
03:33:36,720 --> 03:33:37,040
Friend.

3031
03:33:39,400 --> 03:33:40,800

03:33:56,880 --> 03:33:57,260
Four!

3037
03:33:57,700 --> 03:34:00,480
Oh, it's just three of you.

3038
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:02,780
Whole focus!

3039
03:34:11,480 --> 03:34:12,980
Oh, my god.

3040
03:34:18,970 --> 03:34:19,290
Okay.

3041
03:34:19,910 --> 03:34:25,950

3042
03:34:29,290 --> 03:34:30,810
Tokyo, are you sure?

3043
03:34:31,230 --> 03:34:33,070

3044
03:34:35,230 --> 03:34:35,830
I...

3045
03:34:36,670 --> 03:34:38,610
Okay, I might not have been focusing.

3046
03:34:52,180 --> 03:34:53,840
Okay, I'm giving me a chance to heal.

3047
03:34:56,140 --> 03:34:57,060

03:34:58,680 --> 03:34:59,280

3111
03:39:21,630 --> 03:39:22,450
I'm so close.

3112
03:39:22,570 --> 03:39:24,670
I'm the most locked in I've ever been.

3113
03:39:25,570 --> 03:39:28,770
Oh my god, it is the most locked in.

3114
03:39:28,930 --> 03:39:30,010
I even parried.

3115
03:39:30,230 --> 03:39:32,290
I even parried the dog.

3116
03:39:35,030 --> 03:39:36,550
I'm beginning to believe.

3117
03:39:37,430 --> 03:39:38,830

3118
03:39:43,160 --> 03:39:44,560
Oh, she's just that good.

03:39:44,860 --> 03:39:45,440

She can bleed.

3125
03:39:51,140 --> 03:39:54,280

3126
03:39:56,820 --> 03:39:57,360

3127
03:40:03,210 --> 03:40:03,510

3135
03:41:04,260 --> 03:41:05,020
That was my bad.

3136
03:41:06,640 --> 03:41:08,140
That was so greedy.

3137
03:41:09,480 --> 03:41:11,460
I like forgot the range.

3138
03:41:16,770 --> 03:41:18,390

03:42:18,680 --> 03:42:20,020
I should have reflected that.

3146
03:42:21,660 --> 03:42:24,000
I was trying to run right and actually ran left.

3147
03:42:25,840 --> 03:42:27,220
My fingers were too fast.

3148
03:42:32,490 --> 03:42:33,530

3149
03:42:33,690 --> 03:42:34,610

3152
03:42:44,230 --> 03:42:44,930
I'm learning.

3153
03:42:51,830 --> 03:42:52,010
Alright.

3154
03:42:54,090 --> 03:42:54,750
Here we go.

3155
03:42:55,230 --> 03:42:56,090
Back to hell, I guess.

3156
03:43:00,550 --> 03:43:02,070
Get over here.

3157
03:43:03,170 --> 03:43:06,690
I'll kill your children over and over and over and over again.

3158
03:43:15,310 --> 03:43:16,210
Oh my god.

3159
03:43:17,770 --> 03:43:19,650
I just can't see sometimes.

3160
03:43:19,930 --> 03:43:21,050
That's like the worst part.

3161
03:43:22,410 --> 03:43:23,590
It's just...

3162
03:43:23,590 --> 03:43:25,190
It's just so much clutter.

3163
03:43:25,190 --> 03:43:28,910
All right,

3164
03:43:32,410 --> 03:43:33,470

3165
03:43:34,030 --> 03:43:34,290
Nope.

3166
03:43:35,650 --> 03:43:36,870
Just do that downward smash.

3167
03:43:37,090 --> 03:43:37,850
There you go.

3168
03:43:39,030 --> 03:43:39,950
There you go.

3169
03:43:43,030 --> 03:43:44,370
All right, the three of you.

3170
03:43:46,030 --> 03:43:46,770
All right, here you go.

3171
03:43:49,350 --> 03:43:51,250
I feel like I always get so close.

3172
03:43:55,860 --> 03:43:56,780
Oh my god.

3190
03:45:48,080 --> 03:45:49,680
Because these guys fucking don't matter.

3191
03:45:54,780 --> 03:45:59,840
But these guys don't matter in the long run, so I'm fine with greeting these guys.

3192

I need to know when she arches her back, like, what?

3197
03:46:26,380 --> 03:46:27,780

Okay.

3199
03:46:38,220 --> 03:46:39,260

Okay, I can do a heal here.

3210
03:47:17,970 --> 03:47:20,490

You're hot!

3212
03:47:30,580 --> 03:47:31,160
Unlucky.

3217
03:47:45,220 --> 03:47:46,200
Oh my god.

3218
03:47:46,500 --> 03:47:47,420

3220
03:47:55,840 --> 03:47:56,300

Oh my god.

3223
03:48:03,140 --> 03:48:05,360
I don't think I'm gonna survive this area.

3224
03:48:11,970 --> 03:48:13,410
Oh, I'm literally one hit!

3225
03:48:20,860 --> 03:48:21,800
Literally one... I can't.

3226
03:48:22,500 --> 03:48:24,880
I'm gonna... Oh, I can't use deflect.

3227
03:48:25,140 --> 03:48:26,720
Deflect is like too risky.

3228
03:48:27,380 --> 03:48:28,120
I feel that.

3229
03:48:28,500 --> 03:48:31,360
I'm gonna... It's too risky to do deflect.

3230
03:48:31,520 --> 03:48:33,580
I'm gonna fucking use...

3231
03:48:35,080 --> 03:48:37,000

3233
03:48:39,080 --> 03:49:01,560

Thank God.

3237
03:49:25,080 --> 03:49:26,420
In my dream, they don't matter.

3238
03:49:26,780 --> 03:49:28,000
Or in her dream, it don't matter.

3239
03:49:28,160 --> 03:49:28,940
I'm a dream invader.

3240
03:49:41,100 --> 03:49:41,500
Alright.

3241
03:49:41,820 --> 03:49:42,620
What the fuck?

3242
03:49:42,760 --> 03:49:43,280
Where did he come?

3243
03:49:43,540 --> 03:49:44,500
I thought he was dead.

3244
03:49:45,860 --> 03:49:47,800
I was like, where did he come from?

3245
03:49:52,210 --> 03:49:52,610
Nope.

3246
03:49:52,750 --> 03:49:52,910
Wait.

3247
03:49:58,980 --> 03:49:59,380
Alright.

3248
03:50:00,900 --> 03:50:01,920
Oh, I can heal now.

3249
03:50:01,980 --> 03:50:02,540
Oh, I should have healed.

3250
03:50:03,100 --> 03:50:04,120
I should have healed.

3251
03:50:04,960 --> 03:50:05,360
Alright.

3252
03:50:08,880 --> 03:50:10,380
I think I can use this.

3253
03:50:19,080 --> 03:50:20,060
Jesus Christ.

3254
03:50:26,080 --> 03:50:27,360
I just got enough silk.

3255
03:50:33,330 --> 03:50:33,830
Oh my god.

3256
03:50:33,930 --> 03:50:35,410
I don't know if I wasted that.

3257
03:50:41,590 --> 03:50:42,050
Come on.

3258
03:50:42,390 --> 03:50:43,810
Locking in right now.

3259
03:50:45,210 --> 03:50:45,790
Don't jump.

3260
03:50:46,050 --> 03:50:46,290
Don't jump.

3261
03:50:48,410 --> 03:50:48,810
Nice.

3262
03:50:50,690 --> 03:50:51,610
Are you sick?

3263
03:50:51,630 --> 03:50:54,810
Oh my god, you had to jump!

3264
03:50:59,710 --> 03:51:01,390

Okay, here we go.

3269
03:51:30,980 --> 03:51:31,280
Friend!

3270
03:51:35,140 --> 03:51:36,420
Oh my god.

3271
03:51:38,880 --> 03:51:42,620
Are you- My silk right here?

3272
03:51:51,540 --> 03:51:52,960
I hate her.

3273
03:51:54,140 --> 03:51:57,720
I'm so glad she's not beautiful anymore.

3274
03:52:00,580 --> 03:52:02,220
I'm glad you lost your beauty.

3275
03:52:03,340 --> 03:52:07,980
I just stood there.

3276
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:09,340
I just stood there.

3277
03:52:10,040 --> 03:52:11,340
I just...

3278
03:52:11,340 --> 03:52:12,460
I...

3279
03:52:12,460 --> 03:52:13,520
I...

3280
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:13,540
I...

3281
03:52:13,540 --> 03:52:14,300
I...

3282
03:52:15,420 --> 03:52:16,180
I...

3283
03:52:16,180 --> 03:52:17,920
The Sarah...

3284
03:52:18,640 --> 03:52:18,960
Whoa!

3285
03:52:19,180 --> 03:52:19,500
Whoa!

3286
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:22,060
Damn it.

3287
03:52:24,720 --> 03:52:26,660
I can't use a suit.

3288
03:52:27,140 --> 03:52:28,660
Okay, I might have thrown that one.

3289
03:52:28,920 --> 03:52:32,980
I just think I was like, I'm glad you're not beautiful anymore.

3290
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:39,160
You lost your beauty.

3291
03:52:39,640 --> 03:52:40,960
Now look at you.

3292
03:52:48,820 --> 03:52:50,600
Is there this fucker?

3293
03:52:59,100 --> 03:52:59,740
Okay, okay.

3294
03:53:01,060 --> 03:53:03,200
Eventually I'll start locking in.

3295
03:53:03,740 --> 03:53:04,380
I think this is it.

3296
03:53:04,460 --> 03:53:05,440
I think this is it.

3297
03:53:05,900 --> 03:53:07,560
This is when, this is where it happens.

3298
03:53:09,600 --> 03:53:10,860
Oh my god.

3299
03:53:11,080 --> 03:53:13,680
If I, you're so fast.

3300
03:53:16,900 --> 03:53:18,420
I could grab this in.

3301
03:53:24,020 --> 03:53:25,340
What the fuck?

3302
03:53:25,480 --> 03:53:26,340
How did that hit me?

3303
03:53:31,870 --> 03:53:33,410
Oh, I got hit in too.

3304
03:53:39,800 --> 03:53:40,560
Why was she there?

3305
03:53:41,740 --> 03:53:42,680
Oh my god.

3306
03:53:44,980 --> 03:53:46,920
I hit two crits and I'm gonna waste that shit.

3307
03:53:47,320 --> 03:53:48,100
You know it.

3308
03:54:00,590 --> 03:54:01,190
Okay.

3309
03:54:02,650 --> 03:54:02,910
Oh.

3310
03:54:04,950 --> 03:54:08,370
How did two crits and she still doesn't have a stagger yet?

3311
03:54:08,590 --> 03:54:08,930
What?

3312
03:54:10,270 --> 03:54:11,230
There we go.

3313
03:54:11,410 --> 03:54:11,870

3314
03:54:12,910 --> 03:54:14,510
No fucking way.

03:54:22,410 --> 03:54:22,810
Alright.

3316
03:54:30,270 --> 03:54:30,870
Okay.

3317
03:54:32,230 --> 03:54:34,210
Oh my god, I didn't think she was gonna use that.

3318
03:54:34,890 --> 03:54:36,850
I'm gonna get full HP right now, just in case.

3319
03:54:37,390 --> 03:54:38,990
Yeah, I fucking knew it.

3320

03:57:41,070 --> 03:57:41,670
The mask?

3353
03:57:46,960 --> 03:57:47,580
Where the fuck?

3354
03:57:55,860 --> 03:57:57,240
The hidden hunter one?

3355
03:57:58,720 --> 03:57:59,420
This one, right?

3356
03:57:59,920 --> 03:58:02,540
Between deep docks and...

3357
03:58:03,220 --> 03:58:03,820
Farfields.

3358
03:58:03,860 --> 03:58:05,180
Where the fuck is that?

3359
03:58:05,400 --> 03:58:05,720
Alright, guys.

3360
03:58:05,820 --> 03:58:07,260
I need an extra mask, Bruce.

3361
03:58:10,140 --> 03:58:13,260
Between deep docks and farfields.

3362
03:58:13,280 --> 03:58:13,980
Where is that?

3363
03:58:14,260 --> 03:58:14,680
Here?

3364
03:58:15,680 --> 03:58:16,240
Here?

3365
03:58:18,440 --> 03:58:20,160
Where is that area?

3366
03:58:23,820 --> 03:58:25,640
Is the area it's just in?

3367
03:58:32,260 --> 03:58:32,860
Oh.

3368
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:34,760

3370
03:58:36,220 --> 03:58:37,620
Wait, I don't remember where he lived.

3371
03:58:37,700 --> 03:58:38,440
It was somewhere here.

3372
03:58:38,860 --> 03:58:46,280

03:59:21,950 --> 03:59:23,290
Um... Oh, it was from the bell tower.

3378
03:59:24,190 --> 03:59:24,510
Alright.

3379
03:59:25,630 --> 03:59:28,850
There's an easier one if you go left from Farfields?

3380
03:59:29,810 --> 03:59:30,110
Where?

3381
03:59:31,190 --> 03:59:31,670
Here?

3382
03:59:33,050 --> 03:59:34,710
Where's the easier mask?

3383
03:59:36,490 --> 03:59:38,210
TP to Farfields?

3384
03:59:38,950 --> 03:59:40,670
I want an easy mask.

3385
03:59:40,830 --> 03:59:42,150
I like it when it's easier.

3386
03:59:46,880 --> 03:59:49,060
Because I just need one mask, right?

3387
03:59:49,900 --> 03:59:52,280
I just need one mask anyway to get help upgrade.

3388
03:59:52,540 --> 03:59:52,860
Bam!

3389
03:59:53,100 --> 03:59:53,620

Thank you, thank you!

3392
03:59:59,920 --> 04:00:01,400
Right on the bench.

3393
04:00:01,520 --> 04:00:02,260
Oh, here!

3394
04:00:02,400 --> 04:00:03,540
I didn't go here.

3395
04:00:05,480 --> 04:00:07,340
Maybe I should have.

3396
04:00:08,600 --> 04:00:09,980
What the fuck?

3397
04:00:15,670 --> 04:00:18,670
What the fuck was monkeying?

3398
04:00:23,970 --> 04:00:25,830
Dark, attendant, home wheel.

3399
04:00:27,230 --> 04:00:27,950
What is that?

3400
04:00:31,530 --> 04:00:33,090
I got the cross summons.

3401
04:00:33,290 --> 04:00:34,770
I don't even know what this is.

3402
04:00:38,430 --> 04:00:38,830
Horizon!

3403
04:00:39,230 --> 04:00:40,050
Thank you for the super chat.

04:00:40,130 --> 04:00:41,190
Thank you, thank you.

3405
04:00:42,150 --> 04:00:43,550
Uh, hello, Doki.

3406
04:00:44,170 --> 04:00:45,330
First stream, but long time fine.

3407
04:00:45,450 --> 04:00:46,690
Just wanted to pop in.

3408
04:00:47,150 --> 04:00:52,030
Uh, say that the amount of dopamine you're unhinged to getting produced is solely responsible for my continued existence.

3409
04:00:52,410 --> 04:00:53,210
Thank you for the super chat.

3410
04:00:53,290 --> 04:00:54,210
Thank you, thank you.

3411
04:00:54,210 --> 04:00:55,590
I'm glad you've enjoyed the stream.

3412
04:00:56,270 --> 04:00:59,710
Alright, well, do whatever the fuck they want me to do after I get my mask.

3413
04:01:00,710 --> 04:01:01,330
first.

3414
04:01:02,810 --> 04:01:03,410
Oh my god.

3415
04:01:03,750 --> 04:01:05,270
Bro, I got jury duty?

3416
04:01:08,890 --> 04:01:09,950
It's time.

3417
04:01:11,290 --> 04:01:14,410
I have to do jury duty, guys.

3418
04:01:14,890 --> 04:01:15,810
Give me a sec.

3419
04:01:17,170 --> 04:01:18,290
I've been summoned.

3420
04:01:26,120 --> 04:01:26,620
Oh no.

3421
04:01:26,700 --> 04:01:27,320
Oh no.

3422
04:01:28,040 --> 04:01:28,620
Oh no.

3423
04:01:28,820 --> 04:01:30,020
The boy got him.

3424
04:01:32,000 --> 04:01:34,480
Okay, that means the boy thing is here.

3425
04:01:34,980 --> 04:01:36,180
But are you sick?

3426
04:01:36,920 --> 04:01:37,280
here.

3427
04:01:42,630 --> 04:01:44,210
Oh, we gotta go this way.

3428
04:01:46,850 --> 04:01:47,510
What the?

3429
04:01:52,130 --> 04:01:55,350
Oh, that was fucked up.

3430
04:01:55,850 --> 04:01:57,470
I don't even know what to do with all these rosaries.

3431
04:01:57,750 --> 04:02:03,290
I'm fucking... Oh my god, I was gonna say, I swear to... I'm gonna... I'm bringing these guys along.

3432
04:02:04,630 --> 04:02:06,110
I don't trust myself.

3433
04:02:11,960 --> 04:02:17,420
All right, so we're in a little bit of a small predicament.

3434
04:02:18,040 --> 04:02:18,440
Oh, no.

3435
04:02:18,860 --> 04:02:19,400
Okay, thank God.

3436
04:02:19,640 --> 04:02:20,120
Never punished.

3437
04:02:21,040 --> 04:02:22,160
Thank God.

3438
04:02:23,440 --> 04:02:24,420
Never punished.

3439
04:02:33,100 --> 04:02:34,100
How am I supposed to go?

3440
04:02:40,380 --> 04:02:40,980
Okay.

3441
04:02:41,580 --> 04:02:42,300
Okay, it's fine.

3442
04:02:42,480 --> 04:02:43,820
There's a bench near me anyway.

3443
04:02:45,240 --> 04:02:46,500
Oh my God, it's fine.

3444
04:02:47,840 --> 04:02:51,520

3445
04:02:55,480 --> 04:03:07,160

3452
04:04:18,730 --> 04:04:21,910
Oh my, okay, I got my silk back.

3453
04:04:26,320 --> 04:04:27,340
It's like...

3454
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:31,320
The less screen clutter, the easier it looks.

3455
04:04:31,800 --> 04:04:34,360
The easier is to see the screen.

3456
04:04:35,440 --> 04:04:36,620
Who would have thought?

3457
04:04:40,860 --> 04:04:42,480
How the fuck is this?

3458
04:04:43,400 --> 04:04:44,060
Oh, money.

3459
04:04:45,000 --> 04:04:46,040
That's what it is.

3460
04:04:46,300 --> 04:04:46,920
Money.

3461
04:04:48,440 --> 04:04:48,740
All right.

3462
04:04:49,320 --> 04:04:51,260
I guess this is time to go fight an arena.

3463
04:04:54,460 --> 04:04:54,480
What?

3464
04:04:56,500 --> 04:04:57,260
What?

3465
04:04:59,780 --> 04:05:01,660
Oh, this is why I have to track.

3466
04:05:04,700 --> 04:05:06,200
Let me watch this.

3467
04:05:14,860 --> 04:05:15,960
Wait, is this?

3468
04:05:16,700 --> 04:05:17,420
What is this?

3469
04:05:25,540 --> 04:05:26,020
Yeah?

3470
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:28,600
Where's the tracker going?

3471
04:05:29,100 --> 04:05:30,540
Oh, there it is.

3472
04:05:32,380 --> 04:05:34,020
I don't even know what I'm tracking.

3473
04:05:35,140 --> 04:05:36,400
I was doing something else.

3474
04:05:41,030 --> 04:05:43,530
Oh, is this the quest I was supposed to do?

3475
04:05:50,190 --> 04:05:51,030
Oh my god, please.

3476
04:05:53,270 --> 04:05:54,750
Alright, the mask quest.

3477
04:06:00,800 --> 04:06:01,980
In this way.

3478
04:06:04,340 --> 04:06:05,560
Oh, I'm back here.

3479
04:06:06,000 --> 04:06:07,780
Wait, why the fuck did I have to do...

3480
04:06:07,780 --> 04:06:09,120
Oh my god, did I...

3481
04:06:09,840 --> 04:06:10,660
What is that?

3482
04:06:11,160 --> 04:06:11,160
What?

3483
04:06:14,700 --> 04:06:16,960
I thought I was supposed to do the...

3484
04:06:17,600 --> 04:06:22,340
Oh no, I lost the tracks.

3485
04:06:24,160 --> 04:06:25,340
Wait, where am I supposed to go?

3486
04:06:25,520 --> 04:06:25,780
Okay.

3487
04:06:27,360 --> 04:06:28,620
I assume it's here.

3488
04:06:31,280 --> 04:06:32,880
Yeah, I thought it was an easier mask.

3489
04:06:37,840 --> 04:06:38,480
Oh, it's down.

3490
04:06:38,580 --> 04:06:39,380
I lost the tracks.

3491
04:06:39,460 --> 04:06:41,380
I'm just going with the flow now.

3492
04:06:41,700 --> 04:06:46,720
I- I lost it.

3493
04:06:53,540 --> 04:06:54,760
Where is it?

3494
04:06:57,400 --> 04:06:58,520
Oh, sit bench?

3495
04:06:58,660 --> 04:06:58,920
Okay.

3496
04:07:00,320 --> 04:07:02,160
Okay, I'll go sit on the bench.

3497
04:07:05,440 --> 04:07:06,320
Whee!

3498
04:07:08,080 --> 04:07:08,080
Is

3499
04:07:12,330 --> 04:07:14,290
it here?

3500
04:07:17,620 --> 04:07:18,020
Wait.

3501
04:07:21,980 --> 04:07:24,360
Here's at the three-way junction.

3502
04:07:24,460 --> 04:07:26,460
Below this...

3503
04:07:27,100 --> 04:07:27,520
Here?

3504
04:07:27,780 --> 04:07:28,360
This way?

3505
04:07:37,360 --> 04:07:39,200
Back up and left?

3506
04:07:39,740 --> 04:07:40,720
Oh wait, let's go right.

3507
04:07:41,300 --> 04:07:41,300
Okay.

3508
04:07:43,280 --> 04:07:44,160
It's fine.

3509
04:07:44,320 --> 04:07:44,980
What's he gonna do?

3510
04:07:45,120 --> 04:07:46,300
Fucking kill me?

3511
04:07:47,880 --> 04:07:48,940
Please don't.

3512
04:07:51,220 --> 04:07:51,840
Yeah?

3513
04:07:52,040 --> 04:07:52,660
Wait, no.

3514
04:07:54,680 --> 04:07:57,120
I'm a little worried that there's no tracks.

3515
04:08:03,140 --> 04:08:04,140
Oh, there it is.

3516
04:08:04,620 --> 04:08:04,960
Whoa!

3517
04:08:09,710 --> 04:08:40,690

3518
04:08:47,270 --> 04:08:47,950
Alright.

3519
04:08:48,570 --> 04:08:49,570
Oh, wrong one.

3520
04:08:50,870 --> 04:08:52,830
It was him on the lion's grip.

3521
04:08:54,370 --> 04:08:56,130
You're the goddamn outcast.

3522
04:08:59,910 --> 04:09:01,550
Like, what killed me?

3523
04:09:01,690 --> 04:09:02,890
The goddamn dirt?

3524
04:09:04,830 --> 04:09:07,070
That's... I'm so fucking weak, man.

3525
04:09:07,790 --> 04:09:09,430
Even dirt kills me.

3526
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:18,500
Alright, for rally.

3527
04:09:18,580 --> 04:09:19,700
What's down here?

3528
04:09:23,240 --> 04:09:25,180
Alright, our final stand.

3529
04:09:26,640 --> 04:09:28,680
I accidentally healed.

3530
04:09:30,280 --> 04:09:32,300
Okay, never mind.

3531
04:09:33,440 --> 04:09:34,560
That's awkward.

3532
04:09:39,580 --> 04:09:41,480
Oh, that is so awkward.

3533
04:09:43,800 --> 04:09:44,800
Whoops.

3534
04:09:51,810 --> 04:09:55,010
Oh my god, when he comes down, He also hurts me.

3535
04:09:59,050 --> 04:10:01,310
I need just too much stuff on my screen.

3536
04:10:02,970 --> 04:10:04,010
It's just too much.

3537
04:10:04,570 --> 04:10:05,510
I can't focus.

3538
04:10:10,280 --> 04:10:11,460
It's my hubris.

3539
04:10:13,120 --> 04:10:14,100
Screen clutter.

3540
04:10:16,300 --> 04:10:18,920
It's always a screen clutter.

3541
04:10:20,280 --> 04:10:22,560
I don't know what to do.

3542
04:10:24,640 --> 04:10:25,440
I don't know.

3543
04:10:26,060 --> 04:10:28,460
Screen 2 clutter, I can't see!

3544
04:10:33,950 --> 04:10:36,310
Oh my god, that should not have hit me.

3545
04:10:43,620 --> 04:10:45,460
Oh, wait, now he uses a new move.

3546
04:10:45,580 --> 04:10:46,680
I've never seen that move before.

3547
04:10:49,160 --> 04:10:50,840
Are you serious?

3548
04:10:51,400 --> 04:10:53,380
I'm stuck in this hellhole.

3549
04:10:59,630 --> 04:11:00,190
Alright.

3550
04:11:03,470 --> 04:11:04,710
What the fuck?!

3551
04:11:07,470 --> 04:11:08,590
That's five.

3552
04:11:16,450 --> 04:11:18,090
I need to get this guy out of here.

3553
04:11:21,490 --> 04:11:23,010
There we go.

3554
04:11:25,190 --> 04:11:27,030
There we go.

3555
04:11:28,890 --> 04:11:29,250
Friend.

3556
04:11:32,070 --> 04:11:32,290
Oh.

3557
04:11:33,450 --> 04:11:34,330
New move?

3558
04:11:34,510 --> 04:11:36,650
Oh, the new move is he throws more traps.

3559
04:11:37,370 --> 04:11:38,290
Very cool move.

3560
04:11:42,790 --> 04:11:45,030
Oh my god, you fucking bitch.

3561
04:11:50,520 --> 04:11:51,720
You're nice.

3562
04:11:55,480 --> 04:11:56,860
Oh my god, please, I'm in my own fight.

3563
04:11:57,660 --> 04:11:58,660
We'll talk later.

3564
04:12:00,680 --> 04:12:02,820
Please, stop screaming.

3565
04:12:03,020 --> 04:12:05,180
I'm in my own fucking war right now.

3566
04:12:08,060 --> 04:12:09,260
There we go.

3567
04:12:11,600 --> 04:12:13,200
We did it.

3568
04:12:18,880 --> 04:12:19,860
Oh, does that work?

3569
04:12:20,000 --> 04:12:21,240
What the fuck?

3570
04:12:22,680 --> 04:12:25,480
Oh my god, yeah, there's only a taxidermy.

3571
04:12:25,680 --> 04:12:27,100
Shit going on here.

3572
04:12:30,640 --> 04:12:32,080
Fool me once.

3573
04:12:32,800 --> 04:12:33,720
Oh, is that the mask?

3574
04:12:37,560 --> 04:12:38,520
Grass stuff.

3575
04:12:39,700 --> 04:12:41,280
It's like a little trophy case.

3576
04:12:45,760 --> 04:12:49,400
He's like a... Yeah, he's like a serial killer basement.

3577
04:12:50,100 --> 04:12:51,320
Yeah, I was thinking that.

3578
04:12:51,460 --> 04:12:52,340
It's literally a serial...

3579
04:12:52,340 --> 04:12:54,020
Like, how do you even get these guys?

3580
04:12:54,120 --> 04:12:55,940
These guys don't even live here!

3581
04:12:58,020 --> 04:12:58,700
Wait, that's it?

3582
04:12:59,780 --> 04:13:01,600
There's some spot for me here.

3583
04:13:01,660 --> 04:13:02,580
Oh, wait, I can feel it.

3584
04:13:08,090 --> 04:13:08,610
Alas.

3585
04:13:10,430 --> 04:13:11,110
The heart.

3586
04:13:12,530 --> 04:13:13,770
Come to me.

3587
04:13:15,150 --> 04:13:16,370
Pell, pray.

3588
04:13:18,810 --> 04:13:20,130
Come to me.

3589
04:13:21,430 --> 04:13:22,190
Oh, I guess.

3590
04:13:22,810 --> 04:13:23,910
I'll never know.

3591
04:13:25,370 --> 04:13:25,630
Alright.

3592
04:13:25,870 --> 04:13:27,970
At least I still have some silk left of this.

3593
04:13:32,490 --> 04:13:34,490
I should get a mask now, right?

3594
04:13:36,570 --> 04:13:37,050
Yeah.

3595
04:13:37,530 --> 04:13:37,690
Alright.

3596
04:13:38,850 --> 04:13:39,770
Oh, read his journal.

3597
04:13:40,310 --> 04:13:41,330
What does his journal say?

3598
04:13:41,590 --> 04:13:42,730
What does it say about this freak?

3599
04:13:43,130 --> 04:13:44,310
He tracks and hunts.

3600
04:13:44,570 --> 04:13:45,510
It should have been obvious from the start.

3601
04:13:45,790 --> 04:13:47,410
This old hunter saw to drop me in.

3602
04:13:48,570 --> 04:13:49,890
him to test himself so brutally.

3603
04:13:50,270 --> 04:13:52,330
The answer I suspect I shall never know.

3604
04:13:52,610 --> 04:13:54,210
Oh, he is like the fucking predator.

3605
04:14:01,150 --> 04:14:01,650
Alright.

3606
04:14:06,490 --> 04:14:08,070
He was the goddamn predator.

3607
04:14:09,250 --> 04:14:12,870
Okay, now I should have enough masks now.

3608
04:14:24,840 --> 04:14:26,320
So yeah, we don't need those upgrades.

3609
04:14:27,780 --> 04:14:30,580
I just want my Oh, my mask upgraded.

3610
04:14:33,560 --> 04:14:34,120
Wish granted.

3611
04:14:34,600 --> 04:14:34,780
Yay!

3612
04:14:36,920 --> 04:14:37,840
Yippee!

3613
04:14:42,040 --> 04:14:42,500
Okay.

3614
04:14:43,860 --> 04:14:44,540
So apparently...

3615
04:14:47,000 --> 04:14:48,360
Do I want to kill...

3616
04:14:50,300 --> 04:14:51,240
The last...

3617
04:14:51,240 --> 04:14:53,320
The last lover of the...

3618
04:14:53,320 --> 04:14:54,300
The gay couple.

3619
04:14:55,680 --> 04:14:57,040
Or do I leave him...

3620
04:14:58,000 --> 04:14:58,640
Alive.

3621
04:14:58,640 --> 04:15:27,320
so that he can live knowing that he lost the love of his life and that he'll never find a love just like him and let's live a long life knowing he'll be alone forever oh yeah sorry i had to go jury duty sorry he's hurting yes but should i leave him to suffer sorry guys i gotta go jury duty i forgot about that.

3622
04:15:27,460 --> 04:15:29,100
That one's actually much more important.

3623
04:15:31,740 --> 04:15:33,320
Where is jury duty?

3624
04:15:33,940 --> 04:15:34,820
Am I not here?

3625
04:15:36,560 --> 04:15:38,940
Where exactly is jury duty?

3626
04:15:46,020 --> 04:15:47,000
Well, alright.

3627
04:15:48,120 --> 04:15:48,580
I don't know.

3628
04:15:48,680 --> 04:15:49,360
What are you saying?

3629
04:15:49,760 --> 04:15:51,940
I've never been to jury duty.

3630
04:15:52,560 --> 04:15:53,900
They've never called for me.

3631
04:15:54,240 --> 04:15:55,440
Or maybe they haven't.

3632
04:15:59,260 --> 04:16:02,940

Oh, I thought they would get closer, but I guess not.

3638
04:17:43,790 --> 04:17:44,090
Fuck me.

3639
04:17:51,600 --> 04:17:52,480
Oh, friend.

3640
04:17:55,640 --> 04:17:57,520
Oh, these guys are so annoying.

3641
04:18:03,010 --> 04:18:04,990
They just kept coming up!

3642
04:18:07,630 --> 04:18:09,370
Oh, I'm all the way here.

3643
04:18:09,530 --> 04:18:10,310
Oh, I thought that.

3644
04:18:10,370 --> 04:18:11,690
I forgot to sit at a bench.

3645
04:18:16,360 --> 04:18:16,780
Eita!

3646
04:18:20,900 --> 04:18:23,380
I didn't realize I missed that bench.

3647
04:18:33,430 --> 04:18:34,770
But I go back to the bar.

3648
04:18:35,050 --> 04:18:36,510
Wait, actually I can't make it to the bar.

3649
04:18:36,710 --> 04:18:37,230
I just realized.

3650
04:18:38,990 --> 04:18:41,670
I just realized they're blocking the bar.

3651
04:18:42,810 --> 04:18:43,590
Oh my god.

3652
04:18:43,990 --> 04:18:46,250
I did not mean to fucking take that.

3653
04:18:47,250 --> 04:18:50,810
Alright, me and one Dragoon can't be that bad.

3654
04:18:53,670 --> 04:18:55,150
You got this.

3655
04:18:55,950 --> 04:18:56,870
You and I!

3656
04:19:07,480 --> 04:19:09,520
These are the guys I'm worried about.

3657
04:19:13,760 --> 04:19:13,800
Serious?

3658
04:19:13,960 --> 04:19:14,620
Are you serious?

3659
04:19:14,800 --> 04:19:15,940
He interrupts me twice?

3660
04:19:21,170 --> 04:19:22,290
Oh my god.

3661
04:19:23,850 --> 04:19:24,630
Okay, I can still heal.

3662
04:19:25,010 --> 04:19:25,910
Nice, I just got the heal.

3663
04:19:27,390 --> 04:19:28,190
I'll take those.

3664
04:19:30,690 --> 04:19:32,490
Oh, he's just one.

3665
04:19:32,730 --> 04:19:33,230
Please!

3666
04:19:35,970 --> 04:19:36,470
No!

3667
04:19:37,270 --> 04:19:38,770
Oh my god, that's so close.

3668
04:19:41,950 --> 04:19:43,290
Knock, knock!

3669
04:19:43,890 --> 04:19:45,430
I'm still gonna die here, aren't I?

3670
04:19:46,510 --> 04:19:48,270
Oh no, they're still at bar.

3671
04:19:52,540 --> 04:19:54,120
Just in time.

3672
04:19:54,900 --> 04:19:57,180
Oh, far right.

3673
04:20:05,080 --> 04:20:06,640
It works, it works.

3674
04:20:09,700 --> 04:20:10,800
I'm all about the faith.

3675
04:20:11,020 --> 04:20:13,120
I'm here to do efficiency here.

3676
04:20:13,900 --> 04:20:14,840
Jesus Christ.

3677
04:20:15,820 --> 04:20:17,100
It's all about the efficiency.

3678
04:20:20,960 --> 04:20:21,760
Bird arena.

3679
04:20:22,660 --> 04:20:24,140
What the fuck is the bird arena?

3680
04:20:24,260 --> 04:20:25,740
Oh, it's all the way to the far right.

3681
04:20:33,760 --> 04:20:34,360
Is it here?

3682
04:20:35,300 --> 04:20:37,020
I might go sit on the bench first.

3683
04:20:38,260 --> 04:20:39,860
What did I do wrong, anyway?

3684
04:20:40,000 --> 04:20:40,800
I don't understand.

3685
04:20:46,640 --> 04:20:50,460
What did I deserve to be summoned for jury duty?

3686
04:20:54,740 --> 04:20:56,300
Other than committing, like, several murders.

3687
04:20:56,320 --> 04:20:58,600
I don't understand.

3688
04:21:08,530 --> 04:21:09,730
Bird crimes.

3689
04:21:11,950 --> 04:21:14,010
Okay, but what bird crimes?

3690
04:21:14,170 --> 04:21:14,950
Hello, I'm here.

3691
04:21:18,840 --> 04:21:20,880
Oh my god, it actually is jury duty.

3692
04:21:21,980 --> 04:21:22,720
I hear them.

3693
04:21:24,720 --> 04:21:25,740
Wait, where are they?

3694
04:21:26,280 --> 04:21:27,120
Oh, down?

3695
04:21:30,680 --> 04:21:32,220
I hear all of them.

3696
04:21:32,860 --> 04:21:33,800
Oh, hello.

3697
04:21:43,100 --> 04:21:43,700
Hello?

3698
04:21:47,370 --> 04:21:49,470
You guys called for me?

3699
04:21:50,010 --> 04:21:50,190
Hi.

3700
04:21:52,170 --> 04:21:52,770
Hello.

3701
04:21:53,290 --> 04:21:54,090
Oh, whoa.

3702
04:21:55,010 --> 04:21:56,250
The court of cross.

3703
04:21:57,490 --> 04:21:58,170
Oh, shit.

3704
04:21:58,870 --> 04:21:59,510
Oh, shit.

3705
04:22:00,330 --> 04:22:03,030
Hey, what happened to my right for a lawyer?

3706
04:22:04,350 --> 04:22:07,210
I thought I have a right to a law, to attorney.

3707
04:22:08,570 --> 04:22:08,710
What?

3708
04:22:08,730 --> 04:22:09,490
What happened?

3709
04:22:10,730 --> 04:22:11,870
Where's my trainee?

3710
04:22:16,390 --> 04:22:18,110
I get judged.

3711
04:22:22,890 --> 04:22:24,270
Oh my god, I can't believe I missed everything.

3712
04:22:28,990 --> 04:22:30,890
Are you not gonna get tired and land?

3713
04:22:31,510 --> 04:22:32,370
There we go.

3714
04:22:36,010 --> 04:22:37,290
Trial, like...

3715
04:22:38,750 --> 04:22:40,850
Grab this and then here.

3716
04:22:47,420 --> 04:22:50,360
The bird you kill was your lawyer.

3717
04:22:50,640 --> 04:22:52,940
How the fuck was I supposed to know he was my lawyer?

3718
04:22:53,240 --> 04:22:55,820
He stabbed me first.

3719
04:22:58,360 --> 04:22:58,920
Friend.

3720
04:22:59,660 --> 04:23:01,080
Oh my god, I gotta fight the judge.

3721
04:23:01,640 --> 04:23:02,140
Crawfether.

3722
04:23:05,120 --> 04:23:06,040
What's he doing?

3723
04:23:06,280 --> 04:23:07,000
Oh, shit.

3724
04:23:07,820 --> 04:23:09,140
Okay, that's what he was doing.

3725
04:23:14,120 --> 04:23:21,620
okay friend oh my god fuck of course he summons things they all do

3726
04:23:30,840 --> 04:23:50,640

3727
04:23:56,400 --> 04:23:56,960
Okay.

3728
04:23:59,560 --> 04:24:01,280
Oh my god, they actually wear helmets.

3729
04:24:01,960 --> 04:24:03,480
They're like, no pogo allowed.

3730
04:24:10,370 --> 04:24:11,170
There we go.

3731
04:24:11,790 --> 04:24:12,950
Alright, I killed a judge.

3732
04:24:13,150 --> 04:24:14,410
Now there's no laws.

3733
04:24:15,710 --> 04:24:18,490
No more laws in bird world.

3734
04:24:20,390 --> 04:24:20,950
Promimento.

3735
04:24:21,310 --> 04:24:22,850
Bro, I just get a fucking memory.

3736
04:24:23,710 --> 04:24:24,470
That's it?

3737
04:24:27,150 --> 04:24:28,950
This is a lawless land now.

3738
04:24:31,470 --> 04:24:32,510
It's better to be a crawbell.

3739
04:24:32,670 --> 04:24:33,210
Okay, I was gonna say.

3740
04:24:34,590 --> 04:24:35,890
What is a crawbell?

3741
04:24:41,980 --> 04:24:43,800
What the fuck is a crawbell?

3742
04:24:45,240 --> 04:24:46,380
It's not here?

3743
04:24:50,500 --> 04:24:51,500
Where does it go?

3744
04:24:52,900 --> 04:24:54,220
Oh, there you go.

3745
04:24:55,700 --> 04:24:56,500
Oh, my God.

3746
04:24:56,600 --> 04:24:59,140
It's just for my house that I don't even go to.

3747
04:24:59,860 --> 04:25:01,820
I just live on the streets.

3748
04:25:02,280 --> 04:25:02,620
I have a...

3749
04:25:02,620 --> 04:25:04,200
I choose to be homeless.

3750
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:23,540
It's just like...

3751
04:25:23,540 --> 04:25:24,460
For extra money.

3752
04:25:24,680 --> 04:25:26,480
But I don't even need extra money.

3753
04:25:27,440 --> 04:25:29,600
I bought everything I need here.

3754
04:25:31,140 --> 04:25:31,440
Wait.

3755
04:25:31,920 --> 04:25:32,820
You think they can?

3756
04:25:36,580 --> 04:25:37,560
They're like...

3757
04:25:37,560 --> 04:25:38,400
They're in the water.

3758
04:25:38,780 --> 04:25:40,600
I summoned them in the fucking water.

3759
04:25:43,020 --> 04:25:44,300
They come through here?

3760
04:25:44,660 --> 04:25:45,080
Yeah, they can.

3761
04:25:45,280 --> 04:25:45,440
Okay.

3762
04:25:50,900 --> 04:25:51,760
Wait, why red?

3763
04:25:53,600 --> 04:25:54,760
It's too late.

3764
04:25:57,140 --> 04:25:58,320
Whoa, too late.

3765
04:26:00,480 --> 04:26:02,120
Guess we're never going back.

3766
04:26:02,480 --> 04:26:02,720
Oops.

3767
04:26:06,080 --> 04:26:07,620
What do I need at right side?

3768
04:26:08,360 --> 04:26:12,260
For the optional area or bone borough to finish?

3769
04:26:16,440 --> 04:26:17,280
Oh, I love it.

3770
04:26:17,300 --> 04:26:19,600
Literally, I missed the...

3771
04:26:19,600 --> 04:26:21,500
I missed the prince.

3772
04:26:21,600 --> 04:26:23,080
Was he all the way to the right?

3773
04:26:23,720 --> 04:26:25,080
Was he actually there?

3774
04:26:26,500 --> 04:26:27,620
Oh, what?

3775
04:26:28,000 --> 04:26:29,160
Why would I want him to suffer?

3776
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:31,020
I don't... You know?

3777
04:26:32,060 --> 04:26:32,340
Like...

3778
04:26:32,860 --> 04:26:35,020
Oh my god, they consumed the rat.

3779
04:26:35,500 --> 04:26:36,560
Just like...

3780
04:26:36,560 --> 04:26:44,160
Isn't it better that he gets to live a long life knowing that the love of his life is dead and he has to die alone?

3781
04:26:45,020 --> 04:26:47,120
I feel like that's better.

3782
04:26:48,500 --> 04:26:53,700
he has suffered and no one has suffered enough okay where is he

3783
04:27:03,830 --> 04:27:20,810
like me killing him basically ends the suffering like that's no fun I just think that's not as fun the yaoi should stay doomed

3784
04:27:24,390 --> 04:27:27,690
I feel like he wants to die That's the thing.

3785
04:27:27,910 --> 04:27:31,910
You guys are like, oh, but like you can make it more... No, he wants to die.

3786
04:27:32,550 --> 04:27:34,050
So it's like, what's the point?

3787
04:27:37,110 --> 04:27:45,210
I'd rather murder someone that still has, like, still has the will to live.

3788
04:27:45,850 --> 04:27:47,130
Because that makes it more fun.

3789
04:27:48,530 --> 04:27:50,410
Yeah, I don't want to reunite them in heaven.

3790
04:27:52,910 --> 04:27:54,530
Why would I reunite them?

3791
04:28:02,340 --> 04:28:04,140
What the fuck?

3792
04:28:08,340 --> 04:28:09,460
All right, where is he?

3793
04:28:09,840 --> 04:28:11,060
The fuck is this?

3794
04:28:11,300 --> 04:28:13,740
There's no such thing as fuck Evan.

3795
04:28:14,180 --> 04:28:34,620
Okay, now now that that at least I didn't say that It's like it's like when you know like how um people would be like sweetie your dog's not gonna go ahead dogs Don't go to heaven You know like some parents would say that to their kids they're like I'm silly,

3796
04:28:34,760 --> 04:28:35,860
I'm silly kid.

3797
04:28:36,380 --> 04:28:38,940
Your dog's not gonna go to heaven because they can't.

3798
04:28:41,040 --> 04:28:42,600
No, the cave's not open.

3799
04:28:46,500 --> 04:28:48,540
But all dogs, oh, you're right, it's cats.

3800
04:28:48,960 --> 04:28:50,140
Cats don't go to heaven.

3801
04:28:54,400 --> 04:28:56,680
Oh, I have to talk to him in the Citadel.

3802
04:28:57,000 --> 04:29:00,220
Well, I guess he'll never, I guess he doesn't get to die.

3803
04:29:07,190 --> 04:29:08,530
Yeah, the cave's not open.

3804
04:29:09,370 --> 04:29:10,270
you guys are talking about.

3805
04:29:10,430 --> 04:29:11,330
I assume it's this cave.

3806
04:29:12,230 --> 04:29:13,130
It's not open.

3807
04:29:15,350 --> 04:29:17,150
Yes, they do!

3808
04:29:19,770 --> 04:29:20,550
Oh, no, no, no, no.

3809
04:29:20,550 --> 04:29:21,530
Oh, I have to go here.

3810
04:29:26,690 --> 04:29:28,390
I didn't even talk to that guy.

3811
04:29:29,390 --> 04:29:31,690
Ever since, like, I freed him from his prison.

3812
04:29:32,450 --> 04:29:33,710
I never talked to him again.

3813
04:29:46,860 --> 04:29:47,800
Where we go?

3814
04:29:47,860 --> 04:29:49,300
Oh, we have to go...

3815
04:29:49,300 --> 04:29:50,860
Oh, yeah, we gotta go to Masquerado.

3816
04:29:52,740 --> 04:29:53,240
Born Barrow.

3817
04:29:53,540 --> 04:29:54,080
Boom bottom.

3818
04:29:54,460 --> 04:29:55,300
Time to do the ritual.

3819
04:30:06,120 --> 04:30:07,700
Just like how cats don't go to heaven.

3820
04:30:07,820 --> 04:30:09,420
Bugs don't go to heaven, too.

3821
04:30:10,360 --> 04:30:10,800
That's funny.

3822
04:30:10,920 --> 04:30:12,820
I just kid these guys just for the sake of it.

3823
04:30:14,220 --> 04:30:14,880
Oh, my God.

3824
04:30:14,960 --> 04:30:16,920
My money that I don't even use.

3825
04:30:19,440 --> 04:30:20,160
There you go.

3826
04:30:21,300 --> 04:30:21,660
Goink.

3827
04:30:24,300 --> 04:30:24,660
Goink.

3828
04:30:28,280 --> 04:30:29,560
Did I missed it?

3829
04:30:29,780 --> 04:30:30,520
No, it's over here.

3830
04:30:35,370 --> 04:30:36,910
Alright, do your stupid ritual.

3831
04:30:38,210 --> 04:30:39,590
I'm here now.

3832
04:30:41,810 --> 04:30:44,770
I found the well in the hidden chambers beyond.

3833
04:30:45,250 --> 04:30:48,070
The power that remained on space I've taken up for myself.

3834
04:30:49,030 --> 04:30:51,090
Found yourself a new nature, I?

3835
04:30:51,470 --> 04:30:53,710
And from the shells of our ancestors, no less.

3836
04:30:54,130 --> 04:30:56,450
Oh, there's many who've called these lands their own.

3837
04:30:56,790 --> 04:31:03,430
You make it seem so simple, like strength sucked up in a world of silk.

3838
04:31:04,190 --> 04:31:05,410
We called you a thief.

3839
04:31:05,990 --> 04:31:07,950
Old one and cool for the taken.

3840
04:31:08,490 --> 04:31:11,130
But it's all coming down soon and we can't stop it.

3841
04:31:11,910 --> 04:31:16,810
If there's an advantage in your act that might see these caves safe, then it's better you make your claim.

3842
04:31:18,970 --> 04:31:20,150
Would I not do this thing?

3843
04:31:21,210 --> 04:31:22,410
Fucking do your thing.

3844
04:31:25,350 --> 04:31:27,350
Man, I got the hearts.

3845
04:31:33,870 --> 04:31:34,390
Hmm.

3846
04:31:34,950 --> 04:31:36,070
It is time, shamans.

3847
04:31:36,490 --> 04:31:37,370
I have the hearts.

3848
04:31:37,770 --> 04:31:38,710
Enough as requested.

3849
04:31:39,230 --> 04:31:41,210
Enough to build your spells, yes?

3850
04:31:41,950 --> 04:31:43,610
I were ready.

3851
04:31:45,150 --> 04:31:47,170
Still, it's a sad set you're holding there.

3852
04:31:47,450 --> 04:31:49,810
What strength such as few shall ever know?

3853
04:31:50,350 --> 04:31:52,970
And all about that burn for fire looms saving.

3854
04:31:53,490 --> 04:31:55,390
I'll warn ye old one.

3855
04:31:55,830 --> 04:32:01,290
This first part might not be pleasant, but we'll get you in there, deep as needed.

3856
04:32:02,690 --> 04:32:04,490
Now, you've only...

3857
04:32:04,950 --> 04:32:07,050
You've only got yourself for what comes after.

3858
04:32:07,510 --> 04:32:10,790
Lay up on the dice, and we'll begin.

3859
04:32:11,530 --> 04:32:11,830
Alright.

3860
04:32:12,910 --> 04:32:13,710
That's it.

3861
04:32:14,310 --> 04:32:14,950
Do your thing.

3862
04:32:17,770 --> 04:32:19,150
Oh my god.

3863
04:32:20,910 --> 04:32:21,150
Oh my god.

3864
04:32:35,510 --> 04:32:36,730
I'm consuming the heart.

3865
04:32:36,930 --> 04:32:39,130
What the fuck is going on?

3866
04:32:51,640 --> 04:32:52,760
What the fuck happened?

3867
04:32:54,880 --> 04:32:55,840
I have three hearts.

3868
04:32:55,960 --> 04:32:56,860
I have four hearts now.

3869
04:32:57,200 --> 04:32:58,500
Oh my god, I can never die.

3870
04:33:00,880 --> 04:33:02,380
I'm going to bug it.

3871
04:33:02,480 --> 04:33:03,420
Hey, there's no bug.

3872
04:33:04,820 --> 04:33:05,160
Oops.

3873
04:33:06,900 --> 04:33:07,320
I saw.

3874
04:33:07,500 --> 04:33:07,900
Okay, look.

3875
04:33:08,240 --> 04:33:09,660
How was I supposed to know?

3876
04:33:09,760 --> 04:33:12,060
I saw a hole and I assume I had to go in the hole.

3877
04:33:14,040 --> 04:33:14,840
Oh, I'm...

3878
04:33:14,840 --> 04:33:15,040
Oh.

3879
04:33:16,100 --> 04:33:18,060
Wait, this is a...

3880
04:33:20,860 --> 04:33:22,280
This is a...

3881
04:33:22,280 --> 04:33:23,920
The hunter, Chris.

3882
04:33:26,080 --> 04:33:28,160
Yeah, it's a depot, Chris.

3883
04:33:30,980 --> 04:33:32,440
Every hole is a goal!

3884
04:33:34,200 --> 04:33:35,180
Oh yeah, it's the weavers.

3885
04:33:35,540 --> 04:33:36,640
Oh, it flew me!

3886
04:33:36,740 --> 04:33:38,040
I'm a little baby!

3887
04:33:38,220 --> 04:33:41,520
I'm so- Oh, look at- am I- Wait, so this isn't a mask?

3888
04:33:41,600 --> 04:33:42,780
It's my actual head?

3889
04:33:46,100 --> 04:33:50,540
Child, show it, spend it, as only we can teach.

3890
04:33:52,240 --> 04:33:54,840
I thought that was like, I thought it was a mask.

3891
04:33:56,220 --> 04:33:58,520
Prove yourself more weaver than worm.

3892
04:33:59,940 --> 04:34:00,400
Yeah.

3893
04:34:10,180 --> 04:34:11,800
I'm doing it.

3894
04:34:11,900 --> 04:34:13,800
Oh shit, wait, am I killing them?

3895
04:34:14,680 --> 04:34:17,920
Am I using your silk to make my fucking dress?

3896
04:34:22,860 --> 04:34:23,900
May I kill them?

3897
04:34:26,120 --> 04:34:28,860
Oh, it is a mask, but it's just really small.

3898
04:34:30,640 --> 04:34:32,200
Yeah, I consume them.

3899
04:34:35,880 --> 04:34:36,160
Look at that.

3900
04:34:36,180 --> 04:34:36,660
Hit purity.

3901
04:34:38,100 --> 04:34:38,820
That's all I have to do.

3902
04:34:38,940 --> 04:34:40,740
I just gotta consume them.

3903
04:34:41,920 --> 04:34:43,700
Oh, goodbye.

3904
04:34:49,500 --> 04:34:53,560
Look, I haven't done parkour with this crest in a long time.

3905
04:34:53,980 --> 04:34:55,600
I use baby mode.

3906
04:35:02,870 --> 04:35:03,490
Oh.

3907
04:35:08,270 --> 04:35:08,930
I go down?

3908
04:35:11,530 --> 04:35:13,530
I'm not worried about going down.

3909
04:35:17,300 --> 04:35:18,900
Oh, I just go straight down.

3910
04:35:22,810 --> 04:35:24,770
But, um, it's my three hearts.

3911
04:35:25,130 --> 04:35:25,810
Or four hearts.

3912
04:35:27,350 --> 04:35:28,010
Oh, what?

3913
04:35:28,690 --> 04:35:30,210
Oh, it's a trap station.

3914
04:35:33,130 --> 04:35:35,290
Okay, it apparently doesn't work either.

3915
04:35:43,850 --> 04:35:43,930
Okay.

3916
04:35:43,950 --> 04:35:45,450
Oh, I'm back.

3917
04:35:45,570 --> 04:35:46,310
I'm here.

3918
04:35:47,250 --> 04:35:49,170
Oh I remember this here.

3919
04:35:49,430 --> 04:35:57,650
This one like When I had trust issues Yeah, it's deep nest Oh, this is my mom.

3920
04:35:58,290 --> 04:36:00,450
I don't remember her because she fucking gave birth.

3921
04:36:00,690 --> 04:36:14,330
She put me up and then fucking went to sleep He's horror ignore them daddy their whispers greater grander weaver guardian queen These are their desires not your own own.

3922
04:36:15,790 --> 04:36:17,870
It's certainly not mine.

3923
04:36:19,190 --> 04:36:22,210
Only if you resist them, you might see it.

3924
04:36:22,650 --> 04:36:23,890
Another hope beyond.

3925
04:36:24,730 --> 04:36:30,170
But to call these words in time so far, will you even remember me, child?

3926
04:36:30,870 --> 04:36:31,430
Could you?

3927
04:36:32,610 --> 04:36:34,850
A mother before the mask.

3928
04:36:35,230 --> 04:36:37,810
Before I lay forever in duty.

3929
04:36:37,950 --> 04:36:38,810
Oh, I'm so cute.

3930
04:36:38,890 --> 04:36:39,250
Look at me.

3931
04:36:39,290 --> 04:36:39,970
I'm so tiny.

3932
04:36:43,950 --> 04:36:45,250
and never woke up.

3933
04:36:46,350 --> 04:36:48,370
And that's how I got mommy issues.

3934
04:36:48,690 --> 04:36:49,250
See, Lace?

3935
04:36:49,650 --> 04:36:50,830
You're not so special.

3936
04:36:51,930 --> 04:36:54,250
Why she's so cute when a baby?

3937
04:37:00,610 --> 04:37:02,570
I actually did not need to do the party for this.

3938
04:37:07,630 --> 04:37:08,010
Whoops.

3939
04:37:08,330 --> 04:37:08,690
Goodbye.

3940
04:37:15,460 --> 04:37:17,580
Alright, down I go to another memory.

3941
04:37:18,520 --> 04:37:21,620
I assume I had like three memories because I found three hearts.

3942
04:37:21,740 --> 04:37:24,280
Oh, it's the bees net.

3943
04:37:24,300 --> 04:37:26,080
Oh, I'm gonna talk to the queen?

3944
04:37:26,700 --> 04:37:28,340
She was like my trainer or something?

3945
04:37:30,340 --> 04:37:31,240
Must be.

3946
04:37:33,620 --> 04:37:35,400
She was like my coach.

3947
04:37:39,140 --> 04:37:41,380
It's a hive, yeah.

3948
04:37:46,380 --> 04:37:47,200
Oh, bye.

3949
04:37:49,500 --> 04:37:51,240
I slowly flowed down.

3950
04:37:54,400 --> 04:37:57,260
Yeah, my second mom, who also died.

3951
04:38:00,340 --> 04:38:01,940
My bee mom.

3952
04:38:07,440 --> 04:38:08,840
Oh, ha!

3953
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:10,780
Good,

3954
04:38:14,960 --> 04:38:15,440
better.

3955
04:38:16,320 --> 04:38:17,920
But still you will need to be faster.

3956
04:38:18,900 --> 04:38:20,300
In time, they will come for you.

3957
04:38:20,620 --> 04:38:24,240
Those who fear your nature and those seeking to claim it.

3958
04:38:24,760 --> 04:38:27,540
To survive our world, you must learn to sing.

3959
04:38:27,880 --> 04:38:28,920
Swift and sudden.

3960
04:38:32,640 --> 04:38:33,680
Oh, goodbye.

3961
04:38:34,060 --> 04:38:34,860
And then she died.

3962
04:38:39,080 --> 04:38:42,220
And that's where I got my second mommy issues.

3963
04:38:44,840 --> 04:38:46,500
See, you're not so special, Liz.

3964
04:38:50,520 --> 04:38:51,360
Like, boo-hoo.

3965
04:38:52,040 --> 04:38:53,520
My mother didn't love you.

3966
04:38:53,900 --> 04:38:56,580
My mother fucking went to sleep and never came back.

3967
04:38:57,620 --> 04:38:59,260
And my second mother, I don't know.

3968
04:38:59,340 --> 04:39:00,940
She just grew bigger and then died.

3969
04:39:01,080 --> 04:39:02,480
I don't fucking know how she died.

3970
04:39:07,300 --> 04:39:11,220
I actually don't know how the fuck did the queen with the bee die?

3971
04:39:13,680 --> 04:39:14,860
Like, what happened to her?

3972
04:39:23,340 --> 04:39:25,320
I'm in the white palace, yeah.

3973
04:39:28,930 --> 04:39:31,170
She grew bigger and then just died.

3974
04:39:38,700 --> 04:39:39,620
Oh, that's evil.

3975
04:39:40,640 --> 04:39:41,920
Making me parkour?

3976
04:39:42,960 --> 04:39:44,000
That's fucking evil.

3977
04:39:45,020 --> 04:39:46,340
I'm just gonna glide through this.

3978
04:39:52,640 --> 04:39:53,200
Okay.

3979
04:39:53,220 --> 04:39:54,980
Oh, down I go.

3980
04:39:55,360 --> 04:39:55,960
Another memory.

3981
04:39:56,180 --> 04:39:57,040
I have three hearts.

3982
04:40:07,860 --> 04:40:09,660
Oh, my third mom.

3983
04:40:10,260 --> 04:40:11,200
She didn't love me.

3984
04:40:11,420 --> 04:40:12,920
Because I wasn't her real daughter.

3985
04:40:13,500 --> 04:40:14,740
I was a...

3986
04:40:14,740 --> 04:40:16,740
I was a bastard, child.

3987
04:40:17,800 --> 04:40:19,780
Alas, spider's child.

3988
04:40:20,840 --> 04:40:22,700
For always, you'll think us harsh.

3989
04:40:23,220 --> 04:40:24,120
You'll think us uncaring.

3990
04:40:25,040 --> 04:40:25,560
Unrepentant.

3991
04:40:26,440 --> 04:40:30,100
And so we must seem, for such it's the cost of our wish.

3992
04:40:37,280 --> 04:40:38,840
You're wrong, lady.

3993
04:40:39,520 --> 04:40:42,660
I know the wish and the price to achieve it.

3994
04:40:43,000 --> 04:40:46,900
And now across these many ages, I have only come to know it better.

3995
04:40:48,700 --> 04:40:51,740
Strength in mind, in care, in claw.

3996
04:40:52,120 --> 04:40:58,040
Strength in enough that I may live to see a world better than our own, or to craft the world as I desire.

3997
04:40:58,820 --> 04:41:02,760
That was the wish of my mother, of my mentor, and of you.

3998
04:41:03,620 --> 04:41:05,240
Indeed, Spider, so much.

3999
04:41:05,260 --> 04:41:38,000
much pain you must pass to speak i hope so simply for her you become who knows clear our desire has been full the darkness beneath our house i will show you the gift oh she has the flower this is the flower witness the first light the only means we possess to resist that void of which our family is forever linked reach for a child grow strong rest it from this remembrance burn yourself free from our sad fate.

4000
04:41:38,180 --> 04:41:38,720
Yay!

4001
04:41:40,860 --> 04:41:42,440
I got the flower.

4002
04:41:45,880 --> 04:41:47,340
I got the ever bloom.

4003
04:41:51,310 --> 04:41:53,910
Fragile flower taking from a deep and distant memory.

4004
04:41:54,270 --> 04:41:55,370
I did it, guys!

4005
04:41:55,710 --> 04:41:56,090
Look!

4006
04:41:57,650 --> 04:41:58,950
Look, everyone!

4007
04:42:00,130 --> 04:42:01,790
I got the flower!

4008
04:42:05,090 --> 04:42:05,810
Guys!

4009
04:42:13,100 --> 04:42:13,980
Guys?

4010
04:42:16,860 --> 04:42:19,440
Oh, that's awkward.

4011
04:42:26,500 --> 04:42:30,020
Guys, look, guys, I got some flowers.

4012
04:42:32,440 --> 04:42:33,500
It was...

4013
04:42:33,500 --> 04:42:36,440
They were already dead when I got here.

4014
04:42:38,320 --> 04:42:41,660
Yeah, they went to go visit the snow farm, right?

4015
04:42:42,120 --> 04:42:44,320
From snow farm downstate.

4016
04:42:46,300 --> 04:42:47,340
What happened?

4017
04:42:48,580 --> 04:42:49,920
Oh, was there a crest?

4018
04:42:53,540 --> 04:42:54,820
Oh, wait, it's a map.

4019
04:42:55,260 --> 04:42:56,460
Not the snow farm.

4020
04:42:56,700 --> 04:42:58,380
We already have the mage quest.

4021
04:42:58,800 --> 04:42:59,280
Uh, crest.

4022
04:42:59,840 --> 04:43:00,780
We already have it.

4023
04:43:01,160 --> 04:43:02,360
Do I have enough for Eva?

4024
04:43:02,640 --> 04:43:03,540
I don't even know.

4025
04:43:04,580 --> 04:43:06,640
Yeah, I already got that shit, bro.

4026
04:43:15,330 --> 04:43:17,830
Do I even have enough, though, for Eva?

4027
04:43:19,070 --> 04:43:20,690
Probably not, I assume.

4028
04:43:27,400 --> 04:43:28,380
Alright, I mean, we could try.

4029
04:43:35,250 --> 04:43:37,570
Wait, I want to order food before...

4030
04:43:37,570 --> 04:43:38,670
My favorite restaurant...

4031
04:43:38,670 --> 04:43:40,490
There was a restaurant I wanted to order for a while.

4032
04:43:40,810 --> 04:43:43,410
And it closes at, like...

4033
04:43:43,410 --> 04:43:45,170
It closes at 11.

4034
04:43:45,370 --> 04:43:46,510
So I want to order it.

4035
04:43:47,450 --> 04:43:48,690
Wait, is this the supercomputer?

4036
04:43:49,030 --> 04:43:49,850
Where the fuck is she?

4037
04:43:50,250 --> 04:43:51,190
She's, like, over here.

4038
04:43:52,390 --> 04:43:53,470
Let me order food.

4039
04:43:54,510 --> 04:43:59,050
I've been craving this place for like three days, but I always miss it because of streaming.

4040
04:44:00,730 --> 04:44:02,250
Like it's been three days.

4041
04:44:02,410 --> 04:44:03,990
I was like been craving this place.

04:44:04,590 --> 04:44:07,010

04:45:22,370 --> 04:45:22,870
Okay.

4063
04:45:25,170 --> 04:45:27,090
Strike enemies become more.

4064
04:45:27,550 --> 04:45:29,770
Oh, okay, so my hunter crest got updated.

4065
04:45:30,510 --> 04:45:30,510

There you go.

4075
04:47:18,910 --> 04:47:21,070
Bro, they don't even need a player needle.

4076
04:47:22,250 --> 04:47:24,110
That's why I should kidnap their child.

4077
04:47:25,510 --> 04:47:25,770
Okay.

4078
04:47:26,690 --> 04:47:28,210
Uh, alright.

4079
04:47:28,590 --> 04:47:29,870
Where the fuck was that place?

4080
04:47:29,990 --> 04:47:31,710
This feels like it's been 20 years.

4081
04:47:32,450 --> 04:47:33,130
The abyss.

4082
04:47:33,370 --> 04:47:34,110
How do I get there?

4083
04:47:38,610 --> 04:47:40,290
Oh my god, okay, deep docks.

4084
04:47:40,870 --> 04:47:42,290
Right down, down.

4085
04:47:42,570 --> 04:47:43,630
Alright, we gotta go to the deep docks.

4086
04:47:43,930 --> 04:47:45,070
Alright, it's time.

4087
04:47:45,830 --> 04:47:47,250
It's the final countdown.

4088
04:47:58,780 --> 04:48:00,000
Let's go, time.

4089
04:48:00,280 --> 04:48:02,060
Oh my god, this is not my crest.

4090
04:48:03,540 --> 04:48:04,420
Oh, no, I...

4091
04:48:04,420 --> 04:48:06,220
Now, I definitely don't know where I am.

4092
04:48:06,540 --> 04:48:07,000
I...

4093
04:48:08,020 --> 04:48:08,500
Okay.

4094
04:48:09,540 --> 04:48:10,300
It's okay.

4095
04:48:11,100 --> 04:48:12,980
We're just gonna find the bench.

4096
04:48:16,800 --> 04:48:18,580
There was a bench here, I remember.

4097
04:48:21,780 --> 04:48:22,620
There it is.

4098
04:48:23,060 --> 04:48:24,060
I was like, wait a minute.

4099
04:48:24,700 --> 04:48:26,020
This doesn't seem to be the...

4100
04:48:26,020 --> 04:48:27,840
This is not the crest I use.

4101
04:48:30,800 --> 04:48:32,180
Alright, this should be fine.

4102
04:48:35,080 --> 04:48:37,380
And then we go down here.

4103
04:48:40,700 --> 04:48:41,660
Then we left.

4104
04:48:43,840 --> 04:48:45,200
It's okay, we don't need tools.

4105
04:48:46,280 --> 04:48:47,360
Where I'll come from.

4106
04:48:52,880 --> 04:48:54,840
Uh, this way.

4107
04:48:57,620 --> 04:49:00,840
Yeah, down I'll go.

4108
04:49:02,020 --> 04:49:04,760
Oh, don't keep these.

4109
04:49:06,000 --> 04:49:06,580
It's okay.

4110
04:49:06,820 --> 04:49:08,520
Oh, wait a minute.

4111
04:49:09,240 --> 04:49:10,020
Oh, there it is.

4112
04:49:10,160 --> 04:49:13,840
I was gonna say, oh, forgot about that.

4113
04:49:17,120 --> 04:49:17,880
Oops.

4114
04:49:19,000 --> 04:49:32,000
forgot about the um the lava how the fuck do I go back to hell then like here

4115
04:49:35,380 --> 04:49:42,420
I guess here right back to the bell here right the chair

4116
04:49:47,020 --> 04:49:55,640
do I have to talk to the bell man do I have to go back to the Forge daughter and talk to him?

4117
04:49:57,620 --> 04:49:59,780
Oh my god, this fucker.

4118
04:50:00,560 --> 04:50:01,560
Oh, he's already there?

4119
04:50:01,800 --> 04:50:02,040
Okay.

4120
04:50:02,920 --> 04:50:03,820
Okay, that's good.

4121
04:50:04,440 --> 04:50:05,440
He's already there.

4122
04:50:10,480 --> 04:50:11,580
I was gonna sit.

4123
04:50:11,780 --> 04:50:13,480
Like, did he go back to her?

4124
04:50:13,820 --> 04:50:14,800
Fucking sit.

4125
04:50:17,780 --> 04:50:19,860
Wait, I thought the machine broke.

4126
04:50:19,980 --> 04:50:20,780
Did he fix it?

4127
04:50:31,080 --> 04:50:32,980
Yeah, did he fix it again?

4128
04:50:34,180 --> 04:50:35,320
Oh, he fixed it.

4129
04:50:35,460 --> 04:50:37,340
Okay, I was gonna say, oh, he did fix it.

4130
04:50:37,720 --> 04:50:37,720
Nice.

4131
04:50:38,620 --> 04:50:39,560
All right, take me down.

4132
04:50:41,880 --> 04:50:45,240
Are you feeling mad enough to try and travel?

4133
04:50:45,400 --> 04:50:45,840
Best me up.

4134
04:50:45,900 --> 04:50:46,980
Oh, I have to talk to him.

4135
04:50:47,960 --> 04:50:49,820
Mark, thank you for the magenta soup.

4136
04:50:50,000 --> 04:50:50,540
Thank you.

4137
04:50:50,920 --> 04:50:51,440
Thank you.

4138
04:50:51,920 --> 04:50:53,180
Love your stream of this game.

4139
04:50:53,320 --> 04:50:55,300
I watched your no-hit run against Savage Beast.

4140
04:50:55,480 --> 04:50:56,420
Fly to it and was amazed.

4141
04:50:56,520 --> 04:50:58,100
He made my life the hell he lived in.

4142
04:50:58,340 --> 04:51:01,000
This finale is my favorite part of the whole game.

4143
04:51:01,360 --> 04:51:01,760
All right.

4144
04:51:01,980 --> 04:51:03,100
Thank you for the magenta soup.

4145
04:51:03,280 --> 04:51:03,820
I thank you, thank.

4146
04:51:04,000 --> 04:51:06,060
you've been enjoying the stream so far.

4147
04:51:06,680 --> 04:51:10,060
I didn't think I was going to finish it today, but I already am at the last part anyway.

4148
04:51:10,960 --> 04:51:12,860
I see you survived somehow.

4149
04:51:13,360 --> 04:51:14,920
Thought the last plunge must have been your end.

4150
04:51:15,600 --> 04:51:16,180
It was not.

4151
04:51:16,600 --> 04:51:18,900
I survived the fall and managed a treacherous return.

4152
04:51:19,420 --> 04:51:21,700
But Diamond Bell's failure, the risk was clear to me.

4153
04:51:22,040 --> 04:51:24,080
The fault lies not with you.

4154
04:51:27,480 --> 04:51:33,900
I, as you say, this bell is old and time has a way of breaking things, even as fine porridge as this.

4155
04:51:34,000 --> 04:51:41,660
And see below, before it's failing up and working hard and improving the design, your long journey end up being a valuable test.

4156
04:51:42,680 --> 04:51:42,700
Good.

4157
04:51:43,180 --> 04:51:46,380
Now return path is long close to me, and your bell is now needed again.

4158
04:51:46,840 --> 04:51:47,300
Again?

4159
04:51:47,900 --> 04:51:53,720
Well, if you're game enough to try a second time, a shell shield's been fitted, and a bell's like new.

4160
04:51:53,940 --> 04:51:54,820
Better than you.

4161
04:51:55,280 --> 04:51:59,300
If you're planning on your descent, head down, holler, and I'll get you going.

4162
04:51:59,600 --> 04:52:00,900
All right, down I'll go.

4163
04:52:04,260 --> 04:52:24,400
all right i'm ready next via oh wait wait jk i'm ready for real he's like jk i was joking i'm actually ready at least he fixed it thank god

4164
04:52:29,030 --> 04:52:31,590
it's a good thing you fixed the bell

4165
04:52:38,800 --> 04:53:14,440

4167
04:53:15,960 --> 04:53:20,160
So, um, so I'm not replying back this week.

4168
04:53:20,840 --> 04:53:23,700
But we have, uh, my manager apologized for me.

4169
04:53:24,140 --> 04:53:28,180
Um, I told him to help me to, like, apologize to, like, her manager about it.

4170
04:53:28,560 --> 04:53:32,300
Because I was, like, sorry, I'm literally, like, I'm all over the place.

4171
04:53:32,500 --> 04:53:33,240
Oh my god!

4172
04:53:33,580 --> 04:53:33,940
Ah!

4173
04:53:38,480 --> 04:53:39,480
Alright, I'm alive.

4174
04:53:41,820 --> 04:53:43,300
Oh my god, I have to take that off.

4175
04:53:43,320 --> 04:53:44,120
Fucking, okay, wait.

4176
04:53:44,300 --> 04:53:44,660
Am I?

4177
04:53:45,840 --> 04:53:46,800
Okay, I'm alive.

4178
04:53:46,980 --> 04:53:47,280
It's okay.

4179
04:53:47,440 --> 04:53:47,840
I can...

4180
04:53:48,440 --> 04:53:49,580
I got distracted.

4181
04:53:50,880 --> 04:53:55,700
I plan on replying back and organizing the... and the organizing the shoe eating thing.

4182
04:53:56,420 --> 04:53:56,820
Jesus Christ.

4183
04:53:56,880 --> 04:53:57,700
He like blends in.

4184
04:53:57,780 --> 04:53:58,840
You're gray on gray.

4185
04:54:01,820 --> 04:54:02,300
Uh...

4186
04:54:03,200 --> 04:54:04,320
Soon, TM.

4187
04:54:05,500 --> 04:54:07,760
I literally have not been replying to any messages.

4188
04:54:09,560 --> 04:54:10,980
For like a week plus.

4189
04:54:14,930 --> 04:54:17,190
Where is my fucking... Oh, it's over here.

4190
04:54:17,210 --> 04:54:17,450
here.

4191
04:54:18,470 --> 04:54:20,130
How did it get all the way over there?

4192
04:54:20,830 --> 04:54:23,070
There was no way I traveled that far.

4193
04:54:28,900 --> 04:54:31,840
Well, I was like very overworked and burnt out.

4194
04:54:32,160 --> 04:54:33,780
So I wasn't like replying to anyone.

4195
04:54:34,000 --> 04:54:39,220
I asked my manager to like if there's like any business of emergency to let me know.

4196
04:54:40,060 --> 04:54:42,740
I was just so overworked and burnt out.

4197
04:54:48,650 --> 04:54:51,470
So I just didn't want to like socialize at all.

4198
04:55:00,880 --> 04:55:03,600
Yeah, so the New York trip really helped a lot.

4199
04:55:04,040 --> 04:55:06,360
It really reset myself a lot.

4200
04:55:10,880 --> 04:55:11,500
You think?

4201
04:55:11,860 --> 04:55:12,200
Hmm.

4202
04:55:12,640 --> 04:55:14,180
Maybe this time I can use deflect.

4203
04:55:15,480 --> 04:55:18,080
Oh, because I assume I'm fighting Lace, right?

4204
04:55:19,680 --> 04:55:20,220
I'll try.

4205
04:55:22,360 --> 04:55:23,060
It doesn't work.

4206
04:55:23,200 --> 04:55:24,500
I'll just...

4207
04:55:24,500 --> 04:55:26,140
I'll just, like...

4208
04:55:27,280 --> 04:55:28,640
use something else.

4209
04:55:28,940 --> 04:55:29,340
Child.

4210
04:55:32,380 --> 04:55:33,740
I hope that means to this end.

4211
04:55:34,160 --> 04:55:38,280
Let us meet one in the final time and quell this black ruin of our making.

4212
04:55:39,720 --> 04:55:40,300
Hello, Lace.

4213
04:55:40,760 --> 04:55:42,080
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.

4214
04:55:42,820 --> 04:55:44,900
What are you hoping you'll find down there, Spider?

4215
04:55:45,500 --> 04:55:46,700
An alien child?

4216
04:55:47,160 --> 04:55:48,660
And a silk star beast?

4217
04:55:50,400 --> 04:55:52,020
And so, I'm afraid.

4218
04:55:52,360 --> 04:55:54,280
We may slowly disappoint.

4219
04:55:55,880 --> 04:55:56,800
What waits below?

4220
04:55:58,000 --> 04:55:59,580
As me no longer.

4221
04:56:00,640 --> 04:56:01,400
You're not a...

4222
04:56:01,400 --> 04:56:03,420
Even if only you're shadow remains.

4223
04:56:04,000 --> 04:56:06,680
To release your mother's crypt, my blade will see it slain.

4224
04:56:07,500 --> 04:56:08,600
Then why hold?

4225
04:56:09,180 --> 04:56:13,600
Even this moment, surely terror has this unacclined your heart and heart.

4226
04:56:14,160 --> 04:56:16,060
Take the final plunge, Spider.

4227
04:56:16,700 --> 04:56:22,420
Join us in my drowning palace and let Oblivion swallow us all.

4228
04:56:23,440 --> 04:56:25,520
Oblivion may take, he is child.

4229
04:56:25,900 --> 04:56:28,760
My own life, I shall not sacrifice.

4230
04:56:29,360 --> 04:56:31,060
I survive the fury of your land.

4231
04:56:31,500 --> 04:56:35,640
I have borne in its Barbs and his blades, and I've seen wonder behind his danger.

4232
04:56:36,300 --> 04:56:44,060
But always, child, I mean, made a daughter of hollowness and a void below all things that darkness I will fear no longer.

4233
04:56:45,940 --> 04:56:46,600
All right.

4234
04:56:48,200 --> 04:56:50,220
Time to punch a child.

4235
04:56:52,100 --> 04:56:53,040
Down I'll go.

4236
04:56:53,400 --> 04:56:54,540
Oh, sorry.

4237
04:56:55,100 --> 04:56:56,620
Down I go for real.

4238
04:56:59,020 --> 04:57:00,360
Woo, yeah!

4239
04:57:03,400 --> 04:57:05,360
Santa stab a child!

4240
04:57:09,260 --> 04:57:09,800
Here I'll go.

4241
04:57:14,840 --> 04:57:16,240
Eh, my flower's working.

4242
04:57:22,420 --> 04:57:25,880
I would assume, like, you're like, oh, she's down there.

4243
04:57:25,920 --> 04:57:27,100
I just fucking go down there.

4244
04:57:27,180 --> 04:57:30,400
I didn't realize I had to fucking do another command.

4245
04:57:30,700 --> 04:57:31,720
Oh, no, my flower.

4246
04:57:32,840 --> 04:57:34,400
My flower, it's dying.

4247
04:57:34,640 --> 04:57:35,620
It's so fragile.

4248
04:57:36,540 --> 04:57:37,520
It's like getting eaten.

4249
04:57:37,680 --> 04:57:38,240
Like, nom nom.

4250
04:57:38,260 --> 04:57:39,800
yam yam by a butt grub.

4251
04:57:42,780 --> 04:57:46,380
Oh, oh, it's like the mom made a little silk cocoon.

4252
04:57:46,720 --> 04:57:47,100
I see.

4253
04:57:49,120 --> 04:57:56,600
Like, mom made a little silk cocoon to, like, um, to, like, protect her child.

4254
04:58:00,240 --> 04:58:00,940
Oh, hello.

4255
04:58:01,440 --> 04:58:02,580
Oh, there she is.

4256
04:58:06,480 --> 04:58:06,900
Hello.

4257
04:58:07,500 --> 04:58:09,580
Oh, there's the child.

4258
04:58:11,440 --> 04:58:14,020
Oh, she's been consumed by a boy.

4259
04:58:15,540 --> 04:58:16,000
Lost this.

4260
04:58:16,140 --> 04:58:18,140
Alright, time to get fucking beat up, I guess.

4261
04:58:19,480 --> 04:58:20,800
That hit nothing?

4262
04:58:22,740 --> 04:58:23,780
That's great.

4263
04:58:23,880 --> 04:58:24,940
That's actually crazy.

4264
04:58:26,900 --> 04:58:28,060
That actually hit nothing.

4265
04:58:28,640 --> 04:58:29,380
Holy shit.

4266
04:58:31,540 --> 04:58:33,380
Oh my god, I'm so confused.

4267
04:58:33,780 --> 04:58:35,020
I'm actually so confused.

4268
04:58:45,700 --> 04:58:46,740
Like, I don't know what I'm doing.

4269
04:58:46,760 --> 04:59:13,060

04:59:17,000 --> 04:59:20,180
Oh my god, I have to watch her fucking ascend from the pit

4271
04:59:25,950 --> 04:59:27,310
This is gonna take a while.

4272
04:59:27,390 --> 04:59:30,630
I'm not even I don't even know what oh my

4273
04:59:35,090 --> 04:59:46,770
Really I can tell this is gonna take a while Oh my god that happens she can do that

4274
04:59:52,000 --> 04:59:56,780
Okay I think Lace, like, I don't know.

4275
04:59:57,540 --> 04:59:58,520
Lace is like...

4276
05:00:01,260 --> 05:00:03,900
Lace is like fucking hard.

4277
05:00:05,260 --> 05:00:09,380
She's like the hardest one I've ever, like her iteration.

4278
05:00:12,520 --> 05:00:14,460
There's just something about it.

4279
05:00:14,880 --> 05:00:15,380
Really?

4280
05:00:15,660 --> 05:00:16,700
She does the jump?

4281
05:00:18,160 --> 05:00:19,620
Really Lace is really easy?

4282
05:00:19,960 --> 05:00:21,840
I had trouble with her second phase.

4283
05:00:24,860 --> 05:00:27,000
Her second face fucks with me.

4284
05:00:27,280 --> 05:00:30,740
I just hate to have to watch her ascend from the fucking tar.

4285
05:00:38,980 --> 05:00:39,380
Alright.

4286
05:00:40,160 --> 05:00:42,320
I just hate to have to watch this every time.

4287
05:00:43,840 --> 05:00:46,180
But Lace 2 was very difficult for me.

4288
05:00:47,440 --> 05:00:49,480
Alright, let me see if I can figure out her pattern.

4289
05:00:52,700 --> 05:00:54,700
I want to know when she...

4290
05:00:54,700 --> 05:00:55,480
Okay.

4291
05:00:56,340 --> 05:00:56,860
Okay.

4292
05:01:00,120 --> 05:01:00,760
What?

4293
05:01:01,220 --> 05:01:03,180
Okay, that's bullshit.

4294
05:01:03,960 --> 05:01:05,100
Oh, I forgot to eat myself.

4295
05:01:05,540 --> 05:01:06,060
Give me a sec.

4296
05:01:10,400 --> 05:01:12,540
I'm just wondering if I should...

4297
05:01:14,140 --> 05:01:14,780
Really?

4298
05:01:15,260 --> 05:01:15,880
Oh, okay.

4299
05:01:16,600 --> 05:01:18,080
Okay, I was not expecting that.

4300
05:01:22,880 --> 05:01:23,700
Get Perry.

4301
05:01:26,840 --> 05:01:29,460
I want to use deflect, but I'm so scared.

4302
05:01:30,820 --> 05:01:31,040
Oh.

4303
05:01:31,060 --> 05:01:32,060
I'm just gonna...

4304
05:01:35,400 --> 05:01:37,960
Because I feel like I want to save my...

4305
05:01:38,420 --> 05:01:41,060
I want to save my silk for heals.

4306
05:01:54,110 --> 05:01:54,830
What?

4307
05:01:55,070 --> 05:01:55,490
Okay!

4308
05:01:55,850 --> 05:01:56,650
That's bullshit.

4309
05:02:00,330 --> 05:02:00,730
What?

4310
05:02:08,100 --> 05:02:08,780
Oh no.

4311
05:02:09,600 --> 05:02:10,180
Oh no!

4312
05:02:11,000 --> 05:02:11,360

No, now you have Toho!

4314
05:02:13,940 --> 05:02:15,600
It's not fair!

4315
05:02:18,820 --> 05:02:19,940
I want Toho!

4316
05:02:20,820 --> 05:02:23,620
Why do I never get Toho powers?

4317
05:02:29,100 --> 05:02:29,660
Shit.

05:02:31,340 --> 05:02:33,580

4320
05:02:35,940 --> 05:02:38,220
I don't know what I'm fighting anymore.

4321
05:02:39,160 --> 05:02:40,020
What is this?

4322
05:02:44,330 --> 05:02:46,590

4335
05:03:56,490 --> 05:03:58,470

I thought she was going to go a different direction.

4343
05:04:50,190 --> 05:04:51,070
That sucks.

4344
05:04:56,290 --> 05:04:58,150

You're gonna be part of the problem.

4466
05:14:17,690 --> 05:14:18,850
I don't have tax.

4467
05:14:18,970 --> 05:14:20,370
I've never got them.

4468
05:14:21,870 --> 05:14:24,630

4469
05:14:24,750 --> 05:14:25,450
I was like, cool.

4470
05:14:26,770 --> 05:14:29,470
That would be cool if I have them.

4471
05:14:39,530 --> 05:14:41,990
Oh my god, the only issue is I can't see.

4472
05:14:58,100 --> 05:14:59,900

Surely that's fine, right?

4499
05:18:16,040 --> 05:18:17,340
Oh my god.

4500
05:18:17,760 --> 05:18:19,160
You should put me in the corner again.

4501
05:18:23,480 --> 05:18:25,480

4502
05:18:33,070 --> 05:18:34,690

4507
05:18:48,910 --> 05:18:50,290
I never learned.

4508
05:18:57,500 --> 05:19:08,280
Learning from my mistakes, I flashed my head against a wall until it works that's the joki way that will always be the joki way

Jesus.

4518
05:20:13,420 --> 05:20:18,640
Oh my god, she's fucking me up, she's fucking me up.

4519
05:20:25,590 --> 05:20:26,630

4528
05:20:53,320 --> 05:20:53,800
Oh.

4529
05:20:54,960 --> 05:20:56,420
I was so close.

4530
05:20:56,700 --> 05:20:57,620
I was so close.

4531
05:20:57,800 --> 05:21:01,040
I literally I needed... I didn't think she would hit me back.

4532
05:21:05,560 --> 05:21:08,260
I should have hit her once and fucking healed.

4533
05:21:10,120 --> 05:21:12,100
Well, um, I don't want my cock flies.

4534
05:21:12,120 --> 05:21:14,400
anymore so just see a bit harder now.

4535
05:21:16,120 --> 05:21:18,280
No more talks like it.

4536
05:21:22,070 --> 05:21:24,550
Oh my god, where did you come from?

4537
05:21:28,070 --> 05:21:31,850
Okay, I guess I'll try and focus up.

4538
05:21:33,870 --> 05:21:34,410
I guess.

4539
05:21:37,230 --> 05:21:38,310
What the fuck?

4540
05:21:38,550 --> 05:21:41,430
Okay, I'm like, where did she come from?

4541
05:21:49,020 --> 05:21:49,820
Okay, friend.

4542
05:21:55,020 --> 05:21:55,420
Okay.

4543
05:22:00,660 --> 05:22:02,500
Jesus, I'm just gonna heal here.

4544
05:22:04,040 --> 05:22:04,440
Really?

4545
05:22:08,710 --> 05:22:10,750
And god, I got three hits there.

4546
05:22:13,070 --> 05:22:14,510
Oh my god, she put me in the corner.

4547
05:22:14,690 --> 05:22:15,210
Get me out of here!

4548
05:22:15,490 --> 05:22:15,970
Get me out!

4549
05:22:23,190 --> 05:22:23,990
Oh, really?

4550
05:22:24,910 --> 05:22:25,310
Friend.

4551
05:22:29,330 --> 05:22:29,690
Oh

4552
05:22:32,870 --> 05:22:37,690
Okay I didn't think she was gonna do that.

4553
05:22:38,910 --> 05:22:40,690
Oh, I didn't think she was gonna do that too!

4554
05:22:41,670 --> 05:22:43,470
I didn't think she was gonna do that as well!

4555
05:22:45,670 --> 05:22:47,350
The other guy was like wait she's gonna do that?

4556
05:22:47,670 --> 05:22:48,550
Oh, and then that?

4557
05:22:48,810 --> 05:22:49,770
Oh, and also that?

4558
05:22:49,910 --> 05:22:56,630
Okay, fuck, okay I didn't freak out any of those moves.

4559
05:22:58,970 --> 05:23:01,390
I unfortunately did not predict it.

4560
05:23:05,270 --> 05:23:06,170
Oh, no.

4561
05:23:06,810 --> 05:23:07,730
It's gonna...

4562
05:23:07,730 --> 05:23:08,630
Oh, fuck!

4563
05:23:11,130 --> 05:23:11,470
Whoop.

4564
05:23:12,190 --> 05:23:14,750
I may or may not have jumped a little too early.

4565
05:23:15,330 --> 05:23:17,870
That is what you call my bad.

4566
05:23:26,500 --> 05:23:27,060
Whoopsie.

4567
05:23:31,900 --> 05:23:33,000
Oh, my God.

4568
05:23:34,840 --> 05:23:35,520
Friend.

4569
05:23:40,500 --> 05:23:41,040
Okay.

4570
05:23:44,700 --> 05:23:47,460
Oh, I need she does that.

4571
05:23:48,400 --> 05:23:49,580
Oh, the tentacle!

4572
05:23:51,040 --> 05:23:51,540
What?

4573
05:23:52,460 --> 05:23:53,480
You're on it.

4574
05:23:53,660 --> 05:23:54,880
She did an oopsie.

4575
05:23:58,740 --> 05:23:59,920
Okay, I'm big.

4576
05:24:00,060 --> 05:24:00,660
I'm slowly.

4577
05:24:00,880 --> 05:24:01,840
I'm understanding.

4578
05:24:02,060 --> 05:24:02,940
I'm understanding.

4579
05:24:03,160 --> 05:24:04,800
It's all coming together.

4580
05:24:05,360 --> 05:24:07,360
Everything is coming together right now.

4581
05:24:11,660 --> 05:24:12,260
Okay.

4582
05:24:13,120 --> 05:24:15,260
I know I said that before, but For sure, for real.

4583
05:24:15,840 --> 05:24:16,080
This time.

4584
05:24:16,180 --> 05:24:16,920
I'm locking in.

4585
05:24:16,980 --> 05:24:17,960
I'm locking in.

4586
05:24:18,780 --> 05:24:19,740
For real, this time.

4587
05:24:25,920 --> 05:24:26,780
Okay, after this.

4588
05:24:39,830 --> 05:24:40,630
Oh, shit.

4589
05:24:41,290 --> 05:24:42,870
Are you fucking kidding me?

4590
05:24:43,310 --> 05:24:43,750
Are you?

4591
05:24:44,370 --> 05:24:46,450
Ah, she defeated in front of me.

4592
05:24:46,650 --> 05:24:47,410
Okay, okay.

4593
05:24:47,610 --> 05:24:47,950
You know what?

4594
05:24:47,950 --> 05:24:48,950
I said, I'm locking in for this.

4595
05:24:49,030 --> 05:24:50,090
I'm locking in for real.

4596
05:24:56,960 --> 05:24:57,480
I'm locked.

4597
05:24:57,540 --> 05:24:57,960
This time.

4598
05:24:58,100 --> 05:24:58,520
This time.

4599
05:25:03,090 --> 05:25:04,130
Okay, focus.

4600
05:25:04,570 --> 05:25:05,550
No, no, no, yeah, no,

I hate this.

4603
05:25:10,670 --> 05:25:14,050
I hate that the watcher fucking emerge from that boy.

4604
05:25:15,170 --> 05:25:17,150
And then hearing her scream, like, just fight me.

4605
05:25:17,330 --> 05:25:18,390
I, we've done this already.

4606
05:25:18,670 --> 05:25:19,930
Just, I'm okay.

4607
05:25:20,070 --> 05:25:20,610
Let's just fight.

4608
05:25:20,770 --> 05:25:21,350
We just want to fight.

4609
05:25:24,770 --> 05:25:26,070
Like, bro, I get it.

4610
05:25:26,990 --> 05:25:27,730
Oh, my God.

4611
05:25:29,610 --> 05:25:30,010
Okay.

4612
05:25:45,700 --> 05:25:47,920
I don't want to put too much in the corner.

4613
05:25:55,110 --> 05:25:55,710
Alright.

4614
05:25:58,090 --> 05:25:58,690
Nice.

4615
05:26:02,600 --> 05:26:04,340
There we go.

4616
05:26:05,940 --> 05:26:06,260
Alright.

4617
05:26:07,780 --> 05:26:10,040

4623
05:26:37,790 --> 05:26:38,310
Teal.

4624
05:26:38,790 --> 05:26:39,750
I won't be full HP.

4625
05:26:45,230 --> 05:26:45,270
Oh!

4626
05:26:46,230 --> 05:26:47,190
There we go.

4627
05:26:49,470 --> 05:26:51,010
Her range is crazy.

4628
05:26:54,090 --> 05:26:54,690
Is this?

4629
05:26:54,790 --> 05:26:55,910
It's just so cluttered.

4630
05:26:56,930 --> 05:27:00,290
This part fucks with me so much because it's just too much clutter.

4631
05:27:08,660 --> 05:27:14,480

4635
05:27:56,830 --> 05:27:57,910
I can't ignore it.

4636
05:27:57,970 --> 05:27:59,070
It's in my face.

4637
05:28:01,170 --> 05:28:03,370
I do a no-clutter when it's just there.

4638
05:28:07,530 --> 05:28:08,030
That's it.

4639
05:28:08,250 --> 05:28:09,770
That is how I'm bringing that now.

4640
05:28:22,380 --> 05:28:22,600

All right, friend.

4644
05:28:38,250 --> 05:28:40,270
I was trying to jump that, but it didn't let me.

4645
05:28:42,270 --> 05:28:42,750
Okay.

4646
05:28:46,210 --> 05:28:47,230
Are you serious?

4647
05:28:47,330 --> 05:28:47,870
I'm fucking cursed.

4648
05:28:48,530 --> 05:28:49,610
You always see me to me.

4649
05:28:54,260 --> 05:28:55,840
I hate it when that happens.

4650
05:29:00,740 --> 05:29:01,560
There we go.

4651
05:29:03,480 --> 05:29:03,960
Friend.

Friend!

4658
05:29:30,130 --> 05:29:31,030
God damn it.

4659
05:29:31,450 --> 05:29:32,630
I messed that up.

4660
05:29:37,330 --> 05:29:37,810
Really?

4661
05:29:38,450 --> 05:29:39,350
Oh, my god.

4662
05:29:41,070 --> 05:29:42,730
Teleports behind me.

4663
05:29:49,000 --> 05:29:49,520
There we go.

4664
05:29:50,580 --> 05:29:51,100
You're stupid.

4665
05:29:51,320 --> 05:29:53,760
And you have to watch your goddamn cutscene.

4666
05:29:54,020 --> 05:29:57,820
I- I have to watch your mom falling down.

4667
05:29:59,360 --> 05:30:00,560
Wait, is that his wallet?

4668
05:30:01,360 --> 05:30:02,780
Nah, that's too much.

4669
05:30:13,860 --> 05:30:15,040
Alright, there you go.

4670
05:30:18,300 --> 05:30:19,860
Stupid ass cutscene.

4671
05:30:28,040 --> 05:30:30,160
Oh my god, try to leave this area.

4672
05:30:31,020 --> 05:30:31,520
Friend.

4678
05:30:52,140 --> 05:30:55,380
have reason to be scared.

4679
05:30:58,500 --> 05:30:59,560
Time.

4680
05:31:00,280 --> 05:31:01,580
Dive again.

Alright.

4684
05:31:20,230 --> 05:31:21,810
Oh no, yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah.

05:31:41,530 --> 05:31:42,410
Okay, that was bozer!

4687
05:31:42,690 --> 05:31:43,610
That was bullshit!

4688
05:31:46,270 --> 05:31:47,510
Okay, no yapping.

4689
05:31:47,810 --> 05:31:49,070
Don't let her rage fake you!

4690
05:31:49,390 --> 05:31:50,510
Don't let her win!

4691
05:31:58,710 --> 05:32:00,710
Oh my god, I hate you so much.

4692
05:32:09,710 --> 05:32:10,190
Okay.

4693
05:32:13,620 --> 05:32:15,180
What the fuck was that move?

4694
05:32:15,360 --> 05:32:16,560
I've never seen you do that before.

4695
05:32:21,400 --> 05:32:22,360
Jesus Christ.

4696
05:32:24,540 --> 05:32:25,360
There you go.

4697
05:32:30,330 --> 05:32:31,250
There we go.

4698
05:32:32,430 --> 05:32:34,150
Oh, just be safe.

4699
05:32:36,070 --> 05:32:37,630
Got two crits, I know.

05:32:38,470 --> 05:32:39,350
And now I'm gonna...

4701
05:32:39,350 --> 05:32:40,990

4711
05:33:28,590 --> 05:33:29,090
Okay.

4712
05:33:36,870 --> 05:33:38,210
God, the fucking pit.

4713

A black who?

4714
05:33:40,890 --> 05:33:42,150
A black who?

4715
05:33:44,760 --> 05:33:46,060

05:39:17,690 --> 05:39:19,910
Do I play a song now?

4772
05:39:20,330 --> 05:39:20,570
Do I?

4773
05:39:26,580 --> 05:39:28,040
Oh my god.

4774
05:39:28,460 --> 05:39:28,640
Oh my god.

4775
05:39:28,640 --> 05:39:29,140
We leave.

4776
05:39:29,720 --> 05:39:30,540
Oh my god.

4777
05:39:31,920 --> 05:39:34,380
My people need me.

4778
05:39:35,020 --> 05:39:35,740
My people need me.

4779
05:39:38,120 --> 05:39:42,080
Oh my god, I told you I downloaded it!

4780
05:39:45,220 --> 05:39:47,340
I stilled my song!

4781
05:39:49,400 --> 05:39:52,340
Oh, okay, it didn't take as long as I thought it would.

4782
05:39:52,560 --> 05:39:55,500
I'm not gonna lie, with no tools and magic, like, just magic to heal.

4783
05:39:55,700 --> 05:39:56,940
I think I did pretty alright.

4784
05:40:03,670 --> 05:40:04,930
I did it.

4785
05:40:07,470 --> 05:40:09,070
I suck the song, guys.

4786
05:40:09,350 --> 05:40:10,110
Oh, good boy.

4787
05:40:10,470 --> 05:40:11,450
Who wants to give me a hug?

4788
05:40:20,890 --> 05:40:22,350
Oh, oh, bro!

4789
05:40:22,990 --> 05:40:23,750
Where were you?

4790
05:40:24,050 --> 05:40:24,590
Bros!

4791
05:40:25,510 --> 05:40:26,610
Where the fuck were you?

4792
05:40:26,890 --> 05:40:29,050
Why did you vouch for me, man?

4793
05:40:29,890 --> 05:40:30,690
I thought we...

4794
05:40:30,690 --> 05:40:32,990
I told you to vouch for me.

4795
05:40:33,110 --> 05:40:34,250
Telling the boy we're cool.

4796
05:40:36,590 --> 05:40:37,430
Oh, my God.

4797
05:40:37,530 --> 05:40:38,390
It's John Hollander.

4798
05:40:40,790 --> 05:40:41,910
It's my homie.

4799
05:40:44,510 --> 05:40:45,870
He told a boy that...

4800
05:40:45,870 --> 05:40:48,110
Yeah, now he told a boy that we chill.

4801
05:40:50,170 --> 05:40:51,330
They just did...

4802
05:40:51,330 --> 05:40:56,990
Yeah, after we fucking finished the job, they'd get the North Boy pulled up.

4803
05:41:05,790 --> 05:41:07,690
Bro was stuck in traffic.

4804
05:41:12,860 --> 05:41:16,140
I had to be, like, two hits like, during my other trip...

4805
05:41:16,140 --> 05:41:19,680
When I was that close, I had to be, like, one or two hits or some shit.

4806
05:41:20,400 --> 05:41:22,680
Because it didn't felt like I had to hit her that much in phase two.

4807
05:41:24,560 --> 05:41:35,780

4810
05:41:59,260 --> 05:41:59,900
Oh my god!

4811
05:42:00,040 --> 05:42:01,760
I did not think we were gonna finish.

4812
05:42:02,000 --> 05:42:03,380
We were finishing all the night.

4813
05:42:03,520 --> 05:42:06,140
I had I have two more thumbnails.

4814
05:42:06,520 --> 05:42:08,580
I made preparation.

4815
05:42:10,240 --> 05:42:13,180
Because I was like, oh, because you guys were like, it'll be two streams.

4816
05:42:13,460 --> 05:42:16,160
But like, I've got the three hearts so fast.

4817
05:42:16,240 --> 05:42:18,620
Like, I got it within, like, three, like, what was it?

4818
05:42:18,780 --> 05:42:21,480
Within, like, three to four hours?

4819
05:42:21,820 --> 05:42:47,780
So I was just like, oh, okay, like, I didn't believe I had, I actually had two more thumbnails I made in preparation for the next one but we did it I skipped a lot I know there was a lot of mini bosses that I didn't do because I didn't think there, I thought I had to do more like,

4820
05:42:48,140 --> 05:43:04,780
I thought there was like it was part of the pathway yeah apparently there was like a lot of side content that i didn't do but i beat the game i beat the game and that's all that matters yay i did it before my food got here too which is the best part it

4821
05:43:09,980 --> 05:43:30,020

4822
05:43:30,080 --> 05:43:30,380
Thank you.

4823
05:43:30,420 --> 05:43:30,760
Thank you.

4824
05:43:30,800 --> 05:43:32,220
The reviews were in.

4825
05:43:32,520 --> 05:43:33,740
And his show got canceled.

4826
05:43:35,300 --> 05:43:35,760
Until DLC.

4827
05:43:35,960 --> 05:43:38,540
Yeah, until then maybe a new DLC comes out.

4828
05:43:39,220 --> 05:43:41,080
A Doki Bug will come back.

4829
05:43:42,620 --> 05:43:43,160
Did you know?

4830
05:43:43,260 --> 05:43:44,860
I've recently found this out recently.

4831
05:43:45,220 --> 05:43:51,260
But like, you know how Silk Song or like Silk Song and Hollow Knight are super popular in China?

4832
05:43:51,780 --> 05:43:55,700
And apparently like usually like people don't really do speed runs.

4833
05:43:56,400 --> 05:43:56,720
It's not.

4834
05:43:57,100 --> 05:43:58,760
But Hollow Knight and Silk Song.

4835
05:43:58,780 --> 05:44:03,440
It's like one of the few games that like people love doing speed runs of in Asia.

4836
05:44:03,800 --> 05:44:04,980
Wait, also need me to answer this.

4837
05:44:10,280 --> 05:44:11,000
It was my food.

4838
05:44:11,240 --> 05:44:12,600
I didn't want to say anything because it'd be weird.

4839
05:44:12,960 --> 05:44:14,100
Yeah, I was reading it.

4840
05:44:14,200 --> 05:44:20,400
That's why like a lot of the mods that you see actually originated from the Chinese modding side.

4841
05:44:20,840 --> 05:44:25,860
Like a lot of the skins, the skins, yeah, like Hollow Knight and Silk Side is like huge in China.

4842
05:44:28,800 --> 05:44:32,240
And a lot of the skins you see in Hollow Knight.

4843
05:44:32,260 --> 05:44:38,160
Night actually came from Chinese artists and coders, which is very interesting.

4844
05:44:40,360 --> 05:44:45,240
Odin, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, thank you, be ready in seven years for Hollow Night List.

4849
05:44:53,860 --> 05:44:56,500
I'm not sure what to do for my next series.

4850
05:44:56,880 --> 05:44:59,380
I mean, I have like two more days to figure this out.

4851
05:44:59,780 --> 05:45:00,640

4852
05:45:00,640 --> 05:45:02,240

So I guess our journey ends here, huh?

4862
05:47:59,610 --> 05:48:01,110
It's been a while, right?

05:48:01,250 --> 05:48:02,730
Thank you, the super chat, thank you, thank you.

4864
05:48:02,970 --> 05:48:04,950
Yeah, I literally didn't realize I was gonna finish this day.

4865
05:48:05,050 --> 05:48:06,810
I was gonna, like, make progress of it.

4866
05:48:07,070 --> 05:48:09,030
And then, like, you know, next year would be like, oh, finale.

4867
05:48:09,490 --> 05:48:12,910
But I thought it was, I thought I had a lot to do, but apparently not.

4868
05:48:15,510 --> 05:48:19,990
Apparently, apparently, it was, we were very close to the end.

4869
05:48:19,990 --> 05:48:22,390
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna head off now.

4870
05:48:22,750 --> 05:48:24,450
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

4871
05:48:25,210 --> 05:48:26,370
Oh, yeah, there's Laces Nita.

4872
05:48:27,170 --> 05:48:28,930
Congrats, Steel Soul, run next.

4873
05:48:29,190 --> 05:48:31,310
We're gonna literally die within an hour.

4874
05:48:31,430 --> 05:48:32,330
If I do Steel...

4875
05:48:32,330 --> 05:48:36,550
Have you not seen me face-tank with no regards to my life?

4876
05:48:37,770 --> 05:48:38,930
Fifth, bad.

4877
05:48:39,210 --> 05:48:40,610
Thank you for the Akasupa.

4878
05:48:41,070 --> 05:48:41,870
Thank you, thank you.

4879
05:48:42,790 --> 05:48:47,330
I would be surprised if we last an hour on Steel Soul.

4880
05:48:48,310 --> 05:48:53,570
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, Stay hydrated, posture check, get up, and move around to get that blood flowing.

4881
05:48:53,890 --> 05:48:57,550
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

4882
05:48:57,770 --> 05:48:59,390
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

4883
05:48:59,910 --> 05:49:00,650
Bye, guys.

4884
05:49:01,010 --> 05:49:01,450
