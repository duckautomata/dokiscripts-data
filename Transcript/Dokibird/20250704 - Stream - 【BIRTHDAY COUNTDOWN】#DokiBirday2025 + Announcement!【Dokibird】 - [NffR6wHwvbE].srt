00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,410
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,530
Hello, hello.

3
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,170
Whoa, the scary timer above my head.

4
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,310
Hello, everyone.

5
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,710
Um, I had to add to do one more loop because mentally I was just not there yet.

6
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,710
Um, still I'm not.

7
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,410
It's just been, there's been a lot going on.

8
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,770
I didn't really sleep a lot today in general.

9
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:09,930
Um, and that's why, like, I needed the extra loop just to be, like, just to transport myself back into reality.

10
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,990
Um, hello.

11
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,450
Yes, today is a, uh, today's stream is a birthday countdown.

12
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:25,070
I do have a very special announcement at midnight, um, when the clock strikes midnight.

13
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,750
Um, um, uh, I do have an announcement today.

14
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,390
I give you guys.

15
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,250
So, we're just gonna, uh, wait until then.

16
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,550
Um, after that, I won't be streaming too long after the announcement.

17
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,790
Um, because we gotta prepare for tomorrow's stream!

18
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,690
Tomorrow's actual birthday stream!

19
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,930
Where there's also another announcement!

20
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,670
Ha ha ha!

21
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,950
Back to back to back to back announcements!

22
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,490
Yippee!

23
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,290
Okay, but these are good announcements, though.

24
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,270
They're, like, really fun, good announcement that feeds you guys.

25
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,670
So, uh, are you hungry, Dragoon?

26
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,150
How hungry are you?

27
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,950
Uh, ha ha ha ha ha!

28
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,930
Lord Kuroo says, thank you for the Akasupa!

29
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,150
Thank you, thank you!

30
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,730
Not even my PC breaking as it did earlier could stop me from wishing you a happy birthday, Doki!

31
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,330
I love this fandom, and I'm thankful every day, uh, to be part of it.

32
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,550
Thank you for the Akasupa!

33
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,750
Thank you, thank you!

34
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,390
I really appreciate it, guys.

35
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,130
Thank you guys so much for the support.

36
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,330
Uh, Unholy, thank you for the Super Chat!

37
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,630
Thank you, thank you!

38
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,030
Happy day of birth, Doki!

39
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:29,630
Thank you!

40
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,830
Thank you for the Super Chat!

41
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,070
Thank you, thank you!

42
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,230
I really appreciate it, everybody.

43
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,750
Um, but yeah, I know I said, like, I'd reveal how much the entire thing costs.

44
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,830
I think I'll save that for tomorrow.

45
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,590
I'll save the secret information tomorrow, um, during the birthday stream.

46
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,830
Uh, Solid Snake, thank you for the Super Chat!

47
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,690
Thank you, thank you!

48
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,050
Wishing you the happiest of birthdays, an hour into the future!

49
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,490
Here's some more years to come!

50
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,430
Looking forward to later today!

51
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,570
Thank you again, Solid!

52
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,610
Thank you for the Super Chat!

53
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,530
Thank you, thank you!

54
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:16,970
Um, anyway, guys, uh, if I sound different, um, that, that's my sound team and I are sort of playing around with my mic settings, which is why, like, uh, earlier stream, the Marvel Rivals stream earlier, was a little different as well.

55
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:29,190
Um, I might have sounded a little quieter than usual, but we did, are playing around with, um, with some sound settings, uh, or some sound settings right now to make myself sound better.

56
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,190
A little!

57
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,090
How so?

58
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,830
How, um, how so, guys?

59
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,330
Uh, what makes, what makes me sound different right now?

60
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,970
Uh, but yes, that's why, uh, it was quieter during the Marvel Rivals stream, because we are trying to fix some stuff.

61
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,990
Uh, and, uh, and we adjusted more after the Rivals stream, we adjusted it more, uh, right, uh, for this stream as well.

62
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,050
So we hope we can find, uh, we hope we can, uh, I sound further away.

63
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,350
Well, to be fair, my, I'm, like, turned away from my mic right now.

64
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,070
So, right here, I'm talking to my mic at the moment right now.

65
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,370
So, I don't know that, um, I don't know if, like, I still sound different, or, oh, I sound softer.

66
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,730
I mean, maybe just because I'm tired.

67
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:25,250
But we're trying to make, we're trying to make it so that I sound the, right, um, I sound, like, louder than the last stream.

68
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:34,770
So, uh, my sound team, if you are monitoring this stream right now, um, and want me to adjust anything live, I can, um, just because, like, you know, we have a fucking hour to kill.

69
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,530
Ophelion, thank you for the Akasupa.

70
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,910
Thank you, thank you.

71
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,670
Happy birthday, Doki.

72
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,290
Another year where I'm proud to be a dragoon.

73
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,370
And, uh, you're my kamioshi.

74
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,830
Hope to get a ton of rest after all these announcements.

75
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,110
Thank you, thank you again for the Akasupa.

76
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,410
I really appreciate it, guys.

77
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:01,250
Also, my food's gonna be arriving in the middle of the stream because I actually didn't eat dinner, um, right after the concert.

78
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:07,330
You know, I had to do a little bit of work and then I went straight to doing the Marvel Rival stream.

79
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,290
Like, and I took a nap and then did the Marvel Rival stream.

80
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,910
And I had to do a little bit of work and then I took a nap again and now I'm here.

81
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,010
So, I ordered some food.

82
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,150
I ordered some Japanese skewers.

83
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,990
Uh, so it's gonna arrive.

84
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,770
It might be arriving in the middle of the stream.

85
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,450
So, uh, you're gonna hear my, uh, ringtone.

86
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:38,550
So, yeah, I don't know what the ringtone is because I know that... I don't know if it's a custom ringtone, so... I hope I don't get copyright strike.

87
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,950
I would be very sad because of... Okay, so it's two things.

88
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,290
It's... Okay, so the ringtone could be one of two things.

89
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,070
It could be Teenage Dream from Glee or...

90
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,710
Or Spooky Scary Skeleton, the remix.

91
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,550
So, it's one or the other.

92
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,370
And I know I can get copyright strike on either of those songs.

93
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:12,790
So... One or the other is gonna get me.

94
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,270
But I need to make sure the ringtone's on.

95
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,470
Because I'm worried I'm gonna miss it.

96
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,150
Because the Glee version is the superior version.

97
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,470
It's from the... Excuse me.

98
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,070
It is from the Dalton Glee Club.

99
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,570
Um, where they sing it all in acapella.

100
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,430
And it's really, really good.

101
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,310
It's so much better than the original Katy Perry version.

102
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,390
Like, I don't... I cannot listen to the original Katy Perry version after listening to the...

103
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,670
The acapella Dalton Academy Glee Club.

104
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,430
Uh...

105
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,830
Teenage Dream.

106
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,050
Um...

107
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,430
Anyway.

108
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,270
Uh...

109
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,750
Let's see.

110
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,750
Seijian, thank you for the Akasupa.

111
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,390
Thank you.

112
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,270
Thank you.

113
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,330
Happy birthday, Doki.

114
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,930
Thank you so much for the amazing company.

115
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,930
You bring us in your live stream.

116
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,270
Thank you again for the Akasupa.

117
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:01,750
Thank you.

118
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,450
Thank you.

119
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,770
I really appreciate it.

120
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,490
Thank you, Mike.

121
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,870
Please, uh...

122
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,430
Komplenos, Doki.

123
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,810
I don't know if I... I'm pretty sure I didn't pronounce that correctly.

124
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,390
I'm pretty sure I butchered that.

125
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,630
Uh, thank you for the Super Chat.

126
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:12,970
Thank you.

127
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,570
Thank you.

128
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,810
I was gonna be at the beach, but I thought it'd be weird because, like, I only have daytime beach time.

129
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:19,730
So...

130
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,650
I thought... I figured it'd be pretty weird for me to be there.

131
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,810
So that's why I was like, you know, okay.

132
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,730
You know, it's... it's 11 p.m.

133
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,430
I might as well, like...

134
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,490
I should... I should be in there, like...

135
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,810
I should be more immersive.

136
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,070
Uh, but thank you.

137
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,690
Welcome to the Tomato Farm host.

138
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,630
Welcome, welcome.

139
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,650
Um...

140
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,770
Yeah, I don't have a nighttime beach out...

141
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,890
Beach background for us.

142
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:42,810
Um...

143
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,590
But yes, uh, I'm... I'm...

144
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,850
I'm just so happy it's done.

145
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,030
Um...

146
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,890
But for those who...

147
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,190
Uh, didn't know...

148
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,550
I know I keep saying this a lot.

149
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,290
But for those who, like, heard me say this, like, a millionth time.

150
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,950
But I had, like...

151
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,690
In only a month to get all of this done.

152
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,630
And, like...

153
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,990
That's crazy.

154
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,430
The fact that I did all of the concert within just a month.

155
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,390
Learning, like, you know, the choreo.

156
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,750
And, like, doing, like, uh...

157
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,770
The motion capture.

158
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,430
And, um...

159
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,370
Grabbing people to be able to...

160
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,430
Grab people to be, like, guests at my concert.

161
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,310
Like, within a month, by the way.

162
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,510
Like, literally, we could only...

163
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,830
We had to have all the record...

164
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,350
Uh...

165
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,790
All the...

166
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,070
Uh...

167
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,750
All the, like, the, you know, mixing and stuff.

168
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,630
Done, um...

169
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,470
Uh...

170
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,390
By...

171
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,690
Uh...

172
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,310
From everybody.

173
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,450
To get all the mix...

174
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,450
Like, all the recordings for the songs.

175
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,470
For the mixing.

176
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,230
It had to be done within, like...

177
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,350
A week and a half.

178
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,150
And then, um...

179
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,470
And, like, you know...

180
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,170
We had to plan, like, choreo and everything.

181
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:46,730
And...

182
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,690
Oh my gosh.

183
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,490
It was actually crazy that I did all of that within just a month.

184
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,310
Um...

185
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,550
To be fair...

186
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,670
Um...

187
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,070
And I need you guys to know...

188
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,290
I wasn't sponsored...

189
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,110
Or anything.

190
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,430
Like, no company sponsored this concert.

191
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,590
No, like, outside group sponsored it at all.

192
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,790
All the money...

193
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,570
All the funding for this concert was from my own money.

194
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,410
Um...

195
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,070
So I paid for everything.

196
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,010
For everybody.

197
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,390
So, like, you know, like, the mixing for, um...

198
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,030
All my guests.

199
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,050
And, like, um...

200
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,750
The...

201
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,830
Like, the motion capture for everyone.

202
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,390
Like, it all came...

203
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,410
The expenses all came from me.

204
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,770
So, uh...

205
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,750
I basically sponsored, uh...

206
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,490
My own stuff.

207
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,010
Like, my own concert.

208
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:34,790
Um...

209
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,250
And to be able to do that...

210
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,430
It was because of you guys.

211
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,270
You guys provided me the opportunity.

212
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,170
Um...

213
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,410
By you guys supporting me.

214
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,290
It allowed me to do something, um...

215
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,590
Like this for you guys.

216
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,530
So, um...

217
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:48,910
And this...

218
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,150
I know some of you guys are wondering, uh...

219
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,330
When, uh...

220
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:55,910
Uh...

221
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,490
When will this, uh...

222
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,610
Concert be uploaded onto YouTube?

223
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,430
So, because it was done within a month.

224
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,130
There are, like, little small mistakes here and there.

225
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,190
Like, it's not...

226
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,750
Obviously, like, it can't be perfect.

227
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,070
Because, like...

228
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,210
There were, like, some small mistakes here and there.

229
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,130
Um...

230
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,130
For, uh...

231
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,130
Like...

232
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,870
For some stuff that we were gonna fix.

233
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,170
And, um...

234
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,690
And so...

235
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,630
Because of that, uh...

236
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,310
We're gonna have to...

237
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,890
We're gonna have to fix that throughout the...

238
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,930
We're gonna have to fix it and, like...

239
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,310
Uh...

240
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,810
Make it more polished and everything.

241
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,550
For the actual, like...

242
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,810
Upload onto the channel.

243
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,090
And because, you know...

244
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,010
It's gonna be a bit...

245
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,250
Um...

246
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,170
Because the...

247
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,430
3D production team...

248
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,830
Um...

249
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,010
They told me that they do have another project...

250
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,090
Right after mine.

251
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,670
So they have to...

252
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,090
Change...

253
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,830
Like, they have to focus on that first...

254
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,270
Before they can go back and, like...

255
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,350
Polish everything up.

256
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,270
So...

257
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,670
It might...

258
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,250
I don't know...

259
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,130
I'm waiting for them to give me...

260
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,570
An exact time frame at the moment.

261
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:54,930
Uh...

262
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,950
At the moment for it.

263
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,170
So, um...

264
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,990
Uh...

265
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,850
They have yet to give me a time frame...

266
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,470
Um...

267
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,310
On...

268
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,830
Um...

269
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,390
When that will be...

270
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,770
Uh...

271
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,070
Done.

272
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,770
But I will try my best to give...

273
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,090
You know...

274
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,930
Be transparent about all of this and everything.

275
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,470
Um...

276
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,310
And so...

277
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,390
But it is crazy.

278
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,190
The quality that I received...

279
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,470
For the entire production...

280
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,030
And the concert itself...

281
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,290
Uh...

282
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,390
For it being a month...

283
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,590
Is actually...

284
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,030
Like...

285
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,510
Uh...

286
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,390
When you see...

287
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,130
Like...

288
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,670
You know...

289
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,470
You guys see the recordings of it...

290
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,390
From people who were there.

291
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,570
But...

292
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,750
Um...

293
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,530
The actual...

294
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,150
Like...

295
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,350
Production for it...

296
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,890
With the HD version...

297
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,710
It's crazy that that was done within a month.

298
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,150
Like...

299
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,350
Also, you might notice...

300
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,930
Also...

301
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,630
I'll let you guys know right now...

302
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,990
The escape...

303
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:45,730
So...

304
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,110
Uh...

305
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,450
This...

306
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:46,670
We...

307
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,570
Sloppy Sisters showed up for...

308
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,930
A special appearance...

309
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,890
At the...

310
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,270
Uh...

311
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,670
At the birthday concert...

312
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,490
And...

313
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,510
Um...

314
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,030
And...

315
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,570
The song we did was...

316
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,830
Escape from the City...

317
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,210
Uh...

318
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,650
So...

319
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,210
You guys might notice that...

320
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,630
Compared to the other...

321
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,230
Like...

322
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,090
The other...

323
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,350
Songs in the set list...

324
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,570
Like...

325
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,970
We were just standing there...

326
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,230
Um...

327
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,450
Well...

328
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,110
It's because we sort of did the...

329
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,890
Motion capture for...

330
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,190
That particular...

331
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,290
We did the motion capture for that particular song...

332
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:14,690
Like...

333
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,570
Individually...

334
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,590
So we couldn't really...

335
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,650
Interact with each other...

336
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,990
Ha ha ha ha...

337
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,670
Cause like...

338
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,990
You know...

339
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,590
We couldn't really like...

340
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,130
Interact with each other...

341
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,410
Uh...

342
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:25,770
So like...

343
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:25,950
You know...

344
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,230
Mint did her motion capture for it...

345
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,450
Like...

346
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,250
In Japan...

347
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,210
And everything...

348
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,810
And...

349
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,650
Yeah...

350
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,490
So...

351
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,230
Um...

352
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,970
So you see that like...

353
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,570
Uh...

354
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,290
We're like...

355
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,230
Standing there...

356
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,090
And we're just like...

357
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,030
Moving at our spot...

358
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,390
Uh...

359
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,490
Ha ha ha ha...

360
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,550
So...

361
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,190
Ha ha ha...

362
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,970
Ha ha...

363
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:55,410
So, but in the polished version, we're planning on redoing the motion capture.

364
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,490
My immersion!

365
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,490
I'm just trying to explain why we were all just standing there.

366
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,910
Because we're like, oh, man.

367
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,130
Because, like, I felt really bad.

368
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:13,750
Because I was like, oh, this is, like, the lack of... I felt like there might be, like, the energy for it is different from...

369
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,850
The other... but it was still pretty hype.

370
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,170
Because, like, you know, everyone did amazing in it.

371
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,270
This was Snuffy and...

372
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,930
Laimoo's first time...

373
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,930
First time doing, like, something like this.

374
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,810
Like, a concert.

375
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,350
And this was, like, you know, it's actually pretty funny.

376
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,230
Because this was actually Laimoo's first...

377
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,550
Like, she had the 3D model for, like, a year now.

378
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,450
And she couldn't... didn't know what to do with it.

379
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,110
So this was, like, the first time she could actually, like, use it.

380
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,810
Like...

381
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,730
And then Snuffy's 3D model was actually done within, like, a week.

382
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,690
Like, I think it was a week.

383
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,470
Because I, like, when I invited them to my concert, I asked them, like, oh, do you guys all have...

384
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,670
Do you guys all have 3D models?

385
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,890
Like, for Laimoo and Snuffy.

386
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,090
Because I know Mint does.

387
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:09,330
And, uh, Snuffy was like, oh yeah, I'm having a new debut for my new, um...

388
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,230
For my new design.

389
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,470
And, um...

390
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,050
Uh, she was, like, asking me, like, is that okay?

391
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:19,670
If we could get, like, if I could use my newer 3D, like, newer design.

392
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,410
And I was like, yeah, but, like, I do need to know, like, when can you get the 3D model done?

393
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,070
So we could, like, you know, have it be ready for, uh, for, like, uh, everything.

394
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,350
For, like, production and stuff.

395
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,150
And her modeler actually got it done within a week.

396
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,870
Which was absolutely insane how fast that was.

397
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,710
Um, for, like, the quality that, like, we received.

398
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,170
It was really, really good.

399
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:50,050
Um, and so, uh, yeah, so, like, uh, yeah, it was, I, it was, like, I knew it was less than 4, a week.

400
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,990
But, like, had, someone said, Snuffy said it was 4 days.

401
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,170
So, yeah, it took 4 days for, for her to finish that model and everything.

402
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,650
So this was, like, their first time doing this.

403
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:07,550
And, um, and, um, obviously, like, I'm glad to give them that experience as well.

404
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,390
Like, they didn't have to pay for anything of it.

405
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,270
And, like, I basically, we, I would say, we basically paid for it.

406
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:14,990
Hahaha!

407
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,510
Because my money is your money.

408
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,830
Uh, hahaha!

409
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,190
George, thank you for the super chat!

410
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,310
Thank you, thank you!

411
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,150
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, I'm really bad at reading Chinese.

412
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,510
I can see Lei, and then, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank.

413
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,410
And the ending word is San, haha, which is mountain.

414
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,650
I, I, I think that's San.

415
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,890
I think that's mountain, right?

416
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,150
Uh, you're the proud of many Chinese in Canada.

417
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,510
Thank you, thank you for the super chat!

418
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,470
Thank you, thank you!

419
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,510
I, I think if I could have someone else read it out for me, I know what that says.

420
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,790
I, hahaha!

421
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,010
I, I, no, it's okay!

422
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,970
You're right!

423
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:59,030
I'm just, I'm, I'm, my reading level is at a, uh, is at, like, a third grade level.

424
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,890
I think it's worse now, because I haven't read Chinese in a long time.

425
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,350
I can listen to Chinese, uh, hahaha!

426
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,730
And speak it, obviously.

427
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,350
But thank you again for the super chat!

428
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,450
That really means a lot!

429
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:09,990
Thank you!

430
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,450
Um, for, thank you to the Akasupa!

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,070
Thank you, thank you to my Kamiyoshi!

432
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,250
Happy birthday!

433
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:22,930
I've been a long time lurker since from the before times, but about a year ago, I decided to start interacting in chat, because I wanted to show you my love and support!

434
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,590
I'm so proud of you, and I'm happy to be a dragoon!

435
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,070

I'm glad, I'm glad you've been enjoying your, uh, time.

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,970
It really, really does, uh, mean a lot to me.

441
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,050
Um...

442
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,630
Uh...

443
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,730
Oh, sorry if I lost.

Wait, what was...

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:48,950
Hahaha!

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,970

455
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,390
Oh, it was about the, uh...

456
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:53,750

Okay, wait.

What was I talking?

466
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,090
Okay, I was talking about the...

467
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,050
Oh, the model and stuff.

468
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,290
Um...

469
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,790
And...

470
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,630
So, it was like, you know, every...

471
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,750
Everything just came together at like the...

472
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,130
Hahaha!

473
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,390
At like, uh...

474
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,970
The...

475
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,010
Last possible moment.

476
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,790
Everything came together.

477
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,890
Also, my...

478
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,150
Third monitor...

479
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,950
Died.

480
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,310
I...

481
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,090
Well, it didn't die!

482
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,350
Okay, this is like an issue.

483
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,030
Like...

484
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,810
I need to like...

485
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,650
Fix this real quick.

486
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,010
Sorry.

487
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,790
It like...

488
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,230
Stopped...

489
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,110
Showing up.

490
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,630
Wait, did it actually?

491
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,510
Why is it not turning on?

492
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,350
Hahaha!

493
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,250
That's not good.

494
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:41,970
Hahaha!

495
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,110
Okay, okay.

496
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,590
Turn on.

497
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,030
Okay, I was like...

498
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,970
I was like...

499
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,610
Why is it not turning on?

500
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:49,650
Oh...

501
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,190
Oh, no.

502
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,290
Oh, no!

503
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:53,490
Oh, no!

504
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:53,930
Okay, there you go.

505
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,470
Okay, there you go.

506
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,170
Everything's okay.

507
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:55,730
Hahaha!

508
00:20:59,210 --> 00:20:59,770
Everything's okay.

509
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,110
Okay, let me check my...

510
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,790
Food too.

511
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,550
Real quick!

512
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:03,730
Alright.

513
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,570
Sorry.

514
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,490
I'm all over the place.

515
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,250
I'm so hungry.

516
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:06,970
I'm...

517
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,610
Santino!

518
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,710
Thank you for the super chat.

519
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,130
Thank you.

520
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:10,850
Thank you.

521
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,330
Happy Dookie day!

522
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:12,830
Thank you.

523
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,590
Thank you for the super chat.

524
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,950
Thank you.

525
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,630
Thank you.

526
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,830
Um, what was I on?

527
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,430
Oh, yes.

528
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:42,870
Um, because of the fact that, like, it's gonna, uh, it might take a bit for it to, um, for it to be, like, uh, uploaded, I am planning on adding maybe, like, two more songs, uh, two bonus songs to the concert, um, only because, like, uh, you know, it's just,

529
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,670
like, a little, special thing, because it, and also because the concert's only, like, 33 minutes, so.

530
00:21:50,110 --> 00:22:04,730
So, I need to pad the time a little bit, because I didn't even realize, I was, like, oh my god, like, I did seven songs with three MC portions, and that's only 33 minutes?

531
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,370
I was, like, oh my god, okay, we need to pad the time a little bit.

532
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,610
So, um, I'll add, like, two more in there.

533
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:32,370
Like, we'll do, we'll do some more, we'll add some, well, I'm planning on adding two more songs into the, um, into the actual, uh, oh my gosh, my third monitor is, like, not okay.

534
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,110
It, like, like, it keeps, it keeps turning off!

535
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,350
I can't see my super chat!

536
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,650
Give me a sec, I'm going through stuff right now.

537
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,630
It keeps, like, I don't know why it does that.

538
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,390
That's so annoying.

539
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,230
Also, I hope the BGM is working.

540
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,870
Um, yeah, that ain't good.

541
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,150
My third monitor keeps turning off.

542
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:55,990
Why today?

543
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,290
It's my birthday week!

544
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,770
It's my birthday week!

545
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,630
Why today?

546
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,250
I should, I should have a good day!

547
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,170
I...

548
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,610
Today should be a good day for me!

549
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,410
Um, um, um, uh, cooperative.

550
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,850
Thank you for the Akasupa, thank you.

551
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,670
Happy birthday, Doki!

552
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,830
You're truly the, the gigabird!

553
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,470
Cheers!

554
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,010
Thank you for the Akasupa.

555
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,470
Thank you.

556
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,150
Thank you.

557
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,590
Um, anyway, uh, what?

558
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,310
Oh my gosh.

559
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,810
Okay, wait.

560
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,630
Maybe it's this.

561
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,870
I think I know what to do.

562
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,250
It's like a pop-up that pops up.

563
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,650
Okay.

564
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:44,850
Alright.

565
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,530
That's my birthday.

566
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,110
Typically enough.

567
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,550
Hello?

568
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,810
What did I execute?

569
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,970
Oh my god, what did I do?

570
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,510
It says, execute... Oh my god, did I actually execute it?

571
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,710
Okay, wait.

572
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,770
We gotta fix this again.

573
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,190
Oh my god, PLEASE!

574
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,290
I need my third monitor!

575
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,790
Actually, I can't read Super Chats without it!

576
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,890
Oh!

577
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,110
Oh!

578
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:30,750
I think it's because, like, I have, like, three really tanky monitors that, like, my PC is not okay.

579
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,050
My PC is not okay.

580
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,850
I killed it!

581
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,390
Um, uh...

582
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,490
Um...

583
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,050
We're, oh yeah.

584
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,530
Okay, so, as I was saying, uh, because...

585
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,490
Because, um, like I said, uh...

586
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,370
We are polishing up the concert more.

587
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,370
Um...

588
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:48,990
Um...

589
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,910
For, like, the...

590
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,930
Like, my director's cut.

591
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,030
Um...

592
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,570
I am planning on...

593
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,370
Um...

594
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,510
I...

595
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,890
I...

596
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,330
What is this?

597
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,210
The panel protect process did not complete.

598
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,210
Please press the execute button.

599
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,490
Dude, what the fuck?

600
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:08,740
What?

601
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,550
What?

602
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:16,770
During process, please do not unplug the power cord from the monitor.

603
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,770
What?

604
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,430
No!

605
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:20,890
What?

606
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,870
Okay.

607
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,050
Okay, whatever.

608
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,610
Uh...

609
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,830
I'm, like, reading.

610
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,470
There's, like, this, like, little notification on my third monitor.

611
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,250
But it's, like...

612
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,150
I'm, like, reading.

613
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,830
I'm, like, what is this?

614
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,710
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna have access to my third monitor today.

615
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,350
I...

616
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,870
I have no idea what the fuck is going on.

617
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,450
Anyway!

618
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,510
This third monitor is, like, interrupting everything that I'm trying to say.

619
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,070
Anyway!

620
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,590
As I was trying to say...

621
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,750
Uh...

622
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,450
Um...

623
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,130
Um...

624
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,930
Wait, oh my god.

625
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,590
Yes, the third...

626
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,150
The third monitor died again.

627
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,930
Like, I don't know.

628
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,950
Maybe it's updating the firmware and that's why we don't see anything.

629
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,590
Uh...

630
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,510
So...

631
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,050
Alright.

632
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,770
That's fine.

633
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,210
I guess I don't have a third monitor at the moment.

634
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,330
Um...

635
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:10,930
Oh my gosh.

636
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,130
I don't have chat then.

637
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,310
Let me...

638
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,210
Okay, I need...

639
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,650
Let me grab...

640
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,250
Okay, I need to grab chat real fast.

641
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,230
So at least I can re-chat.

642
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,690
Oh my god.

643
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,050
It keeps interrupting me.

644
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:26,850
Um...

645
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,470
Mal, welcome to Tomato Fire.

646
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,310
Welcome, welcome.

647
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,210
Okay.

648
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,450
Okay.

649
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,350
For real now.

650
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,830
Okay.

651
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,630
So...

652
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,410
Because...

653
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,870
You know, we're gonna be polishing up.

654
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,350
I am planning on redoing the choreo for...

655
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:42,610
Uh...

656
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,430
Uh...

657
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,790
For escape from the city.

658
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:52,610
So we're actually like interacting and moving around the stage instead of us just standing there.

659
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,210
Because, like, it's still pretty good.

660
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:54,850
I'm still...

661
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,530
I'm happy about...

662
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,270
Uh...

663
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,430
Everybody...

664
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,630
Um...

665
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,150
Um...

666
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,770
Really enjoying that...

667
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,090
Really enjoying it as well.

668
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,150
And I've obviously like...

669
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,430
I know it's already like really good.

670
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,530
But I wanna elevate it even more.

671
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,370
To like, you know, make it so that, you know, we're actually interacting with everyone.

672
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,130
Um...

673
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,070
Um...

674
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,490
I wanna make use of the...

675
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,290
The stage a lot more too.

676
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,050
So...

677
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,170
Um...

678
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,930
So...

679
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,390
Uh...

680
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,370
So that's what like...

681
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,830
What I wanna do for it.

682
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,130
For the more polished version.

683
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,770
So...

684
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,910
What you see...

685
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,050
The recordings you see...

686
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,470
And what you saw there...

687
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,050
Was...

688
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,470
Is...

689
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,290
Obviously that's a con...

690
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,910
Like the...

691
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,190
The concert version at...

692
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,810
Um...

693
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,190
At Anime Expo.

694
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,190
But I am planning on like...

695
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,630
I love...

696
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,610
Like that's the only one that I'm planning on like redoing.

697
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,050
In terms of the choreo itself.

698
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,170
But I know like everybody...

699
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,870
I was so happy that everybody enjoyed it.

700
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,350
And we're singing along to it.

701
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,410
And...

702
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:47,770
Uh...

703
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,810
We're having a great time too.

704
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,650
Uh...

705
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,010
More...

706
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,470
More falls!

707
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,650
Thank you to the Akasupa!

708
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,210
Thank you!

709
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,310
Can you bring anything for your birthday?

710
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,830
Can you give me the Supa?

711
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,230
Of course!

712
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,590
Thank you again for the support!

713
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,750
I really appreciate it!

714
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,090
You've been supporting me for so long!

715
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:01,510
More falls!

716
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,470
I still...

717
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,650
I do appreciate it!

718
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,710

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,030

Thank you!

721
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,410
Ryden!

Thank you!

725
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,350
Saiya5lov!

726
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,430
I wish you the best!

727
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,430
And you should play some...

728
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,990
Curse Halo after you finish the game!

729
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:14,830
Or the faux saga!

730
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,070
Hope you can co-op with fans!

731
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,950
Thank you for the super chat!

732
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,290
Thank you!

733
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:17,890
Thank you!

734
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:18,550
Mal!

735
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,050
Thank you for five gifted ships!

736
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:20,570
Thank you!

737
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,550
Thank you guys!

738
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:31,290
But yeah, okay, for those who don't know, Hiro, like, people were like, oh yeah, oh my gosh, Hiro, like, out of nowhere.

739
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:39,910
But she was the one that actually introduced me to the 3D studio.

740
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:47,790
Because it's actually, for those who don't know, the 3D studio that worked on this was from, let me see, what are their names?

741
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:55,510
Uh, was, uh, from Hiro, was from Hiro Esports.

742
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:07,930
And if you guys don't know what Hiro Esports, who Hiro Esports are, they're actually one of the biggest, um, Esports orgs in China that helped me, um, produce this.

743
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,250
So, uh, they've done, they produced a lot of, like, amazing concerts.

744
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,170
And, uh, oh, it's H-E-R-O, like, Hiro as in, like, superhero.

745
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:26,050
Uh, so, no, no, not Hiro, not the, not her name, but it's actually Hiro, superhero, Hiro, Hiro Esports.

746
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:37,470
But they're, like, the, if you Google them, they're, like, the biggest Esports, uh, org that organizes, like, all the biggest, like, um, Esports events in China.

747
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,550
Let me, let me, I don't remember, uh, I forgot it on the top of my head, to be fair.

748
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:53,310
Um, but they basically, um, they did the, they helped develop the, okay, what was it?

749
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,830
I was reading it, I was like, holy shit.

750
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,570
I was like, oh my, they basically helped, they ran the, oh my god, did they actually?

751
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:07,230
Okay, they helped produce the, the Olympic Esports Week, and, oh, what the fuck?

752
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,010
Okay, okay, okay, I forgot about that.

753
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,790
They basically did, like, the Olympic Esports Week for Asia, and then they've done, like, the League of Legends.

754
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,870
Yeah, they've done League of Legends, they helped organize the League of Legends tournaments that are hosted in China as well.

755
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,390
Um, as well as PUBG.

756
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:32,110
So, they did majority of, like, basically majority of the, uh, tournaments that you see in China when it comes to, like, Esports stuff.

757
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,950
So, they were the ones that helped me produce the, um, produce the entire concert.

758
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:51,710
So, it was really, so, like, a huge thank you to, uh, to Hiro for setting me up with the, uh, 3D production team.

759
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,190
Because, like, I was having a hard, especially, like, with the deadline, too.

760
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,910
Because I was, like, asking several, like, JP studios as well.

761
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,410
And a lot of them couldn't really, uh, I got, like, rejected, like, declined.

762
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,410
I won't say rejected, but, like, they saw the time frame, like, you know, within a month.

763
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,550
And a lot of them were, like, we can't do that.

764
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,530
Like, for the JP studios, they were, like, a lot of sudden they couldn't do it.

765
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,670
And then, like, and then they're, like, we have to find people.

766
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,570
We're gonna have to, like, check other people's schedules and everything.

767
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,270
And then, like, obviously time was running out.

768
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:32,850
So I went with... I asked Hiro if I could use her... her... her orgs, her companies... because she's under Hiro Esports.

769
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:40,650
So I asked her if I could use her 3D production team because she did her 3D debut with them and everything.

770
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,550
And it looked really good.

771
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,910
And I've seen some examples of what they've done in the past.

772
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:45,890
I was like, you know what?

773
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,710
I was like, you know what?

774
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,990
Okay, can they do it?

775
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,210
Like, at first I was like, can they do it?

776
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,150
And they were like, yes, we can do it.

777
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,710
And I was like, oh my God, thank God.

778
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,710
I was like, oh, thank fucking God.

779
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,010
They could do it within a month as well.

780
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,570
I was so, so happy.

781
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:11,990
Because like, if this is what they could do within a month, just think about what they could do if they actually had like more time.

782
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,850
Actually, add more time to put everything together.

783
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,990
Like, it could have been a lot better if it wasn't like within a month.

784
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,530
Also, okay, I'll show you guys a funny, I'll show you guys a funny production photo.

785
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,690
When we got all our models like in, added in.

786
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:40,170
Just to like, and they're like, oh, so like the production team were like, so like, what are your heights?

787
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,750
Because, uh...

788
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,450
What, what are, oh, wait.

789
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,970
Oh, thank God.

790
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,710
Okay, give me a sec.

791
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Okay, thank God.

792
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,980
Okay, it's not a copyright ringtone.

793
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:01,560
Thank God.

794
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,340
Unless, unless Apple decides to copyright me.

795
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
It, it should be fine.

796
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,680
Oh, thank God.

797
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,180
Oh, it wasn't, it wasn't teenage dream or, um, or spooky scary skeletons.

798
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,200
Oh, thank God.

799
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,420
Oh, we're okay.

800
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,520
Um, okay.

801
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,760
So, um, they like asked me like, so what are your heights?

802
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,220
Because, um, when you sent us the models, everybody's heights are very different.

803
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,520
And I was like, what do you...

804
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,960
I was like, oh, what do you mean by that?

805
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,640
And okay, I'll show you guys.

806
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,140
I'll show you guys.

807
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,920
This is them like inputting, like, you know, inputting the model in.

808
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,060
And then I was like, what the fuck, Snuffy?

809
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,680
So, so she was a lot, she was gonna be a lot shorter.

810
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,960
I was like, yeah, that's not right.

811
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,960
That's not that.

812
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,640
I was like, wait a minute.

813
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,360
This, this does not make sense.

814
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:27,940
So, um, so, we, uh, we had to like, be like, oh, yeah, like, no, she's not, she's not that small.

815
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,400
I thought that was, um, um, really funny.

816
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,480
Also, like, honestly, my favorite, one of my favorites is the right drag wound.

817
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,040
So, I did party rock anthem.

818
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,820
Um, I learned how to shuffle.

819
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:52,140
I actually, there is another choreo that was done for that specific part.

820
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
That, um, we tried out.

821
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,720
But, um, cause like, it was like, cause like, um, we're like, do we do the shuffling?

822
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,900
Or like, do we do like, but obviously the shuffling is so iconic that we kept the shuffling instead.

823
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,740
And, um, and, but there is a different version of, of the choreo.

824
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,580
That'll show tomorrow.

825
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,630
Every day we sh, every day we're shuffling.

826
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,370
moot, moot, moot, moot.inding, moot, moot, moot, moot, moot, moot, moot, moot, moot!

827
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:37,820
Okay, so, um, um, um, for those who are, okay, I- I thought it was really funny because, like, it's basically like... You know, like, Katy Perry, left shark and right shark?Hahahahha!

828
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,230
That was, that was my inspiration.

829
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,590
So, for those who didn't see the recordings yet.

830
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:59,130
There is a specific moment there where... where a dragoon pops out and it's a giant fucking ass dragoon mascot that's like dancing with me.

831
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:05,690
So it was like, you know, it's like basically left shark, but like left right dragoon.

832
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:14,570
And people were wondering, okay, I don't know if you guys noticed the voice, who it was in terms of...

833
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,810
of like the voice.

834
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:37,430
Basically, I asked... I asked Shachi if she wanted to do this because I was like, I need someone to be the female voice in this concert because I was like, oh yeah, I need someone to sing this fucking part because it's so hard.

835
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:50,490
And I wasn't going to be like Doki Bird with Doki Bird and Doki Bird because I was already... it was already Doki Bird and Doki Bird and like I needed one more because I can't sing that high.

836
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:56,750
And I needed someone to be the female voice.

837
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,190
So I like asked her, I was like, bro, you down?

838
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,450
Like, do you want to sing Party Rock Anthem with me?

839
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:10,410
And like, do you want to do a Party Rock Anthem?

840
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,570
And like, you know, it's also a short part too.

841
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,510
It's not like too long.

842
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:18,710
She just shows up at the end and be like, what was it?

843
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,530
Put your hands up.

844
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,670
Like, it's such a short part.

845
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,290
She just repeats it over and over again.

846
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,290
And she was like, bro, I'm fucking down.

847
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,710
She was like, she was like, I can't believe you're singing Party Rock Anthem at a concert.

848
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,170
And I was like, indie baby.

849
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:49,410
She was just like, I can't believe you're doing...

850
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,790
She was like, bro, I'm so fucking down.

851
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,590
Um, and, uh...

852
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,810
Um, but yes, that was... that was her.

853
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,050
Um, also, uh, blah, blah, blah, you guys didn't know.

854
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,250
The chorus, originally, there was no backing track to... to me.

855
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,550
When it came to, um, the chorus of, um, of the song.

856
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,110
So, like, it was just me like, everybody...

857
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:17,850
Oh, yeah, well, fucking...

858
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,270
Oh, my gosh, my brain is so fried that I already forgot how to sing the song.

859
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,930
Oh, my God, that'll be...

860
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,950
Party Rock Anthem.

861
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,930
Guys, my brain is so fried right now.

862
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,190
I already forgot.

863
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,910
Um, Party Rock is in the house tonight.

864
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,130
Everybody just have a good time.

865
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,130
Okay, so you know that part?

866
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,390
It was just gonna be me.

867
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,010
And then we realized that it sounded really awkward.

868
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,590
That it was just gonna be me.

869
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,890
Um, when I was, like, singing it and practicing it.

870
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,630
Um, and so, like, um, we were, like, okay, we should...

871
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,090
Because, like, you know, in the original...

872
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:02,330
In the original of Party Rock, um, there is, like, a chorus backing to it, too.

873
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,730
So, uh, so...

874
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,390
Within...

875
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:10,330
I had to get it done within, like, a day to add the chorus backing.

876
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,750
Because, like, you know, we were already so deep into, like, production of everything.

877
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,490
And, like, practicing and all that stuff.

878
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,570
Um, and so, like, I hit up, like...

879
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,650
Obviously, like, Min is in Japan.

880
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,110
So, like, I knew she would be, like, way too busy.

881
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,410
Because I was like, oh, I'll just get all the sloppy sisters to, like, do the chorus.

882
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,130
But, obviously, she's in Japan at the moment.

883
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,690
So, um, so she couldn't...

884
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,510
It was just, like, three lines, too.

885
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,390
Like, we just needed three lines for the chorus.

886
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:43,290
Um, so, uh, so I asked, uh, you know, I asked Laimu and Snuffy.

887
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,630
And because it's also three different harmony parts, too.

888
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,970
So, each person did a different harmony of Party Rock.

889
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,250
And, uh, so I asked Laimu and Snuffy.

890
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,110
And then also Doobie.

891
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:01,430
So, all three of them were singing the backing track for Party Rock Anthem.

892
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,850
And they all, like, send me the recordings within, like, the next day.

893
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,370
So, like, a huge shout-out to them for, like, doing that.

894
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,050
Because it was, like, so last minute.

895
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:09,870
Um...

896
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:18,390
So, like, I'm really thankful that they were able to do that for me and everything.

897
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,910
Um, but yeah, it was honestly, like...

898
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,630
Um, it was honestly, like, such a great experience.

899
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,330
Oh, I actually got screenshots, too.

900
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,770
Let me...

901
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,070
I can show you guys some of the screenshots, um...

902
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,270
Of the concert.

903
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,890
Also, my...

904
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,130
I think my food's outside my door.

905
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,090
Um...

906
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,850
I'm so hungry.

907
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,590
I think you guys have no idea how hungry I am.

908
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,570
How hungry...

909
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,570
I'll show you guys.

910
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,270
Oh, I'll show you guys.

911
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,770
Oh, they're, like, HD, too.

912
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,210
Ooh.

913
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,230
Oh, I'll show you this.

914
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,650
Oh, my gosh.

915
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,230
I have screenshots of it.

916
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,090
Uh, that they sent me.

917
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,690
Oh, no.

918
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,530
Okay, wait.

919
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,350
Sorry, I, like...

920
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,490
I, like, resized it outside.

921
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,190
Oh, look.

922
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,050
Oh, my God.

923
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,610
Look.

924
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:05,870
Look.

925
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,350
It's a doll kitty.

926
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:08,290
Look.

927
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,190
Oh, my God.

928
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,290
That's me.

929
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,670
And then there's...

930
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,930
Let's see.

931
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,310
Which other one can I show you guys?

932
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,710
Uh...

933
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,250
And then there's...

934
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,670
It's, like, Nya?

935
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,910
So cute!

936
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,810
Ah!

937
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,380
And...

938
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,080
Which other ones can I show you guys?

939
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,260
I can show you guys...

940
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,000
I think this, too.

941
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,420
Ooh.

942
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:34,880
Look.

943
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,880
It's so aesthetic.

944
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,640
Ooh.

945
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,880
Look at that.

946
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:38,980
Whoa.

947
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,380
Look how aesthetically pleasing this looks.

948
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,140
Whoa.

949
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,080
But you can see, like, some of the things I want to fix.

950
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,700
So, um, this was something we couldn't fix because, um...

951
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,980
we would have...

952
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,820
It would take, like, a couple of days to do.

953
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,560
Um, but we didn't have time for that.

954
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,840
So, like, we've noticed this, like, literally on the day of the concert.

955
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,000
Uh, which was the shadow texture.

956
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,480
So, this is, like, one of the things I want to fix on the polished version.

957
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,300
Which was the, um...

958
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,080
The texture of the shadows.

959
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,040
So, you can see that it's not transparent.

960
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,880
Um, and that was, like, a little thing that we forgot to do because it was, you know, it was just, like, little things that I want to fix.

961
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,960
So, you know, for the YouTube, um, upload, I do want to, like...

962
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,680
We can do it.

963
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,280
We just forgot.

964
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,040
Like, the production team just forgot to, like, fix that part.

965
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,340
And obviously, like, with all the things that were going on, um, with...

966
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,780
To make this done in a month, like, obviously, that slipped through.

967
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
And I think that's okay.

968
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,340
I think it's okay during, like, the concert version of it.

969
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,380
Like, you know, the live concert version of it.

970
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:51,800
Um, but, like, you can see, like, here that it's not transparent, uh, uh, on the shadow, the shadow texture.

971
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,660
So that's, like, one of...

972
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,300
That's why...

973
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,600
Why...

974
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:00,380
Why one of the reason why I wanted to, like, uh, polish it more, too, so that you guys get, like, you know, the best quality version of this.

975
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,200
Um, uh, but yeah, anyway, let me grab my food real quick.

976
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,880
I'll be right back, guys.

977
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,820
I'm so hungry.

978
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,320
I'm sorry.

979
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,880
I keep saying I'm hungry, but I'm really hungry.

980
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,520
I'm not time.

981
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,700
I'm on something real quick before we...

982
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,320
before we go back, because...

983
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,890
Come on, this.

984
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:23,070
I ordered, like, mentaiko udon.

985
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:28,410
They didn't give me chopsticks!

986
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:29,850
Are you fucking kidding?

987
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:31,050
Okay, guys, let me decide.

988
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,350
I need to grab chopsticks.

989
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:33,170
I'll be right back.

990
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,650
This always happens when I, like, order late night.

991
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,670
They, like, always...

992
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,590
They never give me, like, utensils, even when I request utensils late at night.

993
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:07,530
I don't know.

994
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,670
It's always, like, late night stuff when that happens.

995
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,830
Um...

996
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,170
I have to wash the chopsticks, too, because...

997
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,550
Oh, my God.

998
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,330
It looks so good.

999
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:18,710
Ah...

1000
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,730
My birthday mukbang.

1001
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,190
Okay.

1002
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,050
Dad might start barking, though, because he's been, like, pretty bratty lately.

1003
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:31,490
Um...

1004
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,170
He's been really, really bratty.

1005
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:34,210
Um...

1006
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:34,770
Also...

1007
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,590
Okay, I know I'm...

1008
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,950
I should talk about this while I'm eating.

1009
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:37,890
I'm...

1010
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:38,550
Oh, my God.

1011
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,650
I have no idea how fucking overfed.

1012
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:47,990
He was so overfed when I brought him back from the dog sitter because, like, ever since then, he does little boy poops.

1013
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,610
I was like...

1014
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:55,270
I was like, how did that came out of your bot three, four, five times, by the way?

1015
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,750
Like, five fucking times in, like, one sitting.

1016
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,110
I was like, how the fuck did that happen?

1017
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,930
And now, like, since then, it's just little boy poops.

1018
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,910
I don't understand.

1019
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:05,730
Like...

1020
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,450
The fucking incident.

1021
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,230
Oh, my gosh.

1022
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,190
Let me...

1023
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,690
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom this real quick.

1024
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,010
I just want one...

1025
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,090
At least one bite before I start talking.

1026
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,380
I muted myself a little bit because I don't want to hear me slurping.

1027
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,220
There's more than one bite.

1028
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:56,880
I can't stop.

1029
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,520
All right, I couldn't...

1030
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,440
I couldn't stop.

1031
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,980
I know I said one bite and then I was like, oh, my God.

1032
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,060
It's so good.

1033
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,600
I was like, oh, my God.

1034
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,340
Maybe it's not gonna be one bite.

1035
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,220
It's so good.

1036
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,520
Um...

1037
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:40,500
Um...

1038
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,360
But yeah, um...

1039
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,020
I really appreciate...

1040
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,700
I really...

1041
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,520
Um...

1042
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,620
I want to say enjoy the experience.

1043
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,700
It was so fucking stressful.

1044
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,320
I...

1045
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,900
My staff team was like, you're fucking crazy.

1046
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:54,620
Because...

1047
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,460
If you guys...

1048
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,240
Okay, um...

1049
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,200
Because for the birthday stream, I also have a very...

1050
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,920
Something very special plan for the birthday stream.

1051
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,960
So my staff was like, you're fucking crazy doing both of these at the same time.

1052
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,920
Because for those who didn't know, my staff team did not help me for the concert.

1053
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,260
Like, that was my choice.

1054
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,780
And that was a fucking stupid choice.

1055
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,700
It was literally me and the production team in a Discord server together.

1056
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,260
My staff team wasn't in there because I was like, no, no, I want to handle all of this myself.

1057
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,620
Because I was like, I want...

1058
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,980
Like, I wanted to do...

1059
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,080
Because, like, it was my vision.

1060
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,980
So I was like, no, I want to do this all myself because it was my vision.

1061
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:40,060
And, like, I want to make sure, like, my vision is... the vision I have can be done.

1062
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,520
So I was like, I want to, like, be fully in charge of this myself.

1063
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,220
So I did delegate this one.

1064
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,980
I mean, to be fair, my staff was at... I did have my staff at Anime Expo.

1065
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,300
So, like, one of my staff members was there to help coordinate everything as well.

1066
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:02,140
And, like, she was... we had one of our staff members there to help with a lot of stuff.

1067
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,620
For those... oh, yeah, by the way, if you're at Anime Expo, we are auctioning off the...

1068
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,040
We are auctioning off the concert stand, which is apparently fucking huge.

1069
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,780
I saw... I saw... I don't know.

1070
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,780
If you live in L.A., you might be able to win the birthday concert stand.

1071
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,080
So, it's up to... it was very expensive, by the way.

1072
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,740
That's actually, like, a last-minute idea.

1073
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,480
By my staff member that was on-site.

1074
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,260
Um, because, like I said...

1075
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,540
Also, I can't believe there was a middle screen in the end.

1076
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,500
That was not on the map.

1077
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,880
And it was never told to us.

1078
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:48,780
Like...

1079
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,580
I was like...

1080
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,140
So, there was a middle screen.

1081
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,300
But it was, like...

1082
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,780
In front of some of the rows.

1083
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,400
So, people who were at the back...

1084
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,020
Um, can see the middle screen.

1085
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:01,940
Um...

1086
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,860
But, like, if you were in the front row, you don't get the middle screen.

1087
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,460
Because it was, like, at the back.

1088
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,060
So, like, you know, it was a couple of rows after.

1089
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:09,820
So...

1090
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,580
But there was a fucking middle screen.

1091
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,720
I was like...

1092
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,940
I was like, wait a minute.

1093
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,900
What the fuck is that?

1094
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,160
I was like...

1095
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,620
That's the screen right here.

1096
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,400
And he was like...

1097
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,680
I was like...

1098
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,040
I know.

1099
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,780
It wasn't on the map.

1100
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,520
Like, I...

1101
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,720
I don't know why.

1102
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,120
Why the fuck wasn't that on the map?

1103
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,880
I...

1104
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,860
But anyway...

1105
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,360
Um...

1106
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,160
It was her idea to get the...

1107
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,380
The stands and stuff.

1108
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,060
Because we were like...

1109
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,380
Like, what do we do for the center?

1110
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,400
Because, like...

1111
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,360
Look, I have no...

1112
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,880
Nothing against unions.

1113
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,740
Or, like, the fire marshals.

1114
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,780
Because apparently, Anime Expo had, like...

1115
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,440
A fire...

1116
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,000
Like...

1117
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,940
Not a fire incident.

1118
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,240
But there was, like...

1119
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,320
Smoke, apparently.

1120
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,040
At Anime Expo.

1121
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,040
Um...

1122
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,720
Where, like...

1123
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,380
One of the halls was, like, filled with smoke or some shit.

1124
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:58,960
Because they...

1125
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,400
They're, like, one of the fans, like...

1126
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,240
Broke or some shit.

1127
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,100
So, like, you know...

1128
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,800
They got for the fire marshals there.

1129
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,320
Um...

1130
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:10,900
Um...

1131
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,000
Um...

1132
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,800
Yeah, so...

1133
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,080
Um...

1134
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,500
They're, like, you can't have a middle screen.

1135
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,360
Um...

1136
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,000
Because of it.

1137
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:16,740
Um...

1138
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,420
And I was, like, why the fuck didn't they tell us about the middle screen?

1139
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,400
That's clearly there!

1140
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,340
It wasn't on the map, though.

1141
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:26,580
Um...

1142
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,880
Yeah, I saw that tweet.

1143
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,840
I was, like, oh shit.

1144
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,220
I hope I can still do my content.

1145
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:31,960
But, yeah.

1146
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,040
It was...

1147
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,580
It was such a challenge.

1148
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,440
Because this was the first time that...

1149
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,180
Well, not the first time.

1150
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,920
But it was my own concert, you know?

1151
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,040
Like, um...

1152
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,140
It was my own thing.

1153
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,620
Because I feel like I wouldn't really get invited to these types of actual...

1154
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,260
Like, you know, like, big-ass concert-type deals.

1155
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,520
Where, like...

1156
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,020
Um...

1157
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,940
At the concert venue.

1158
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,560
Because, like, as you guys know, I'm not really, like, the singer...

1159
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,980
The singer VTuber.

1160
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,960
Like, I...

1161
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,760
I, you know, I'm more so, like...

1162
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,640
I play video games.

1163
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,380
So, that's what I'm known for.

1164
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,500
I play video games and...

1165
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,960
And sometimes I play them pretty well.

1166
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,700
Um...

1167
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,720
And that's what I'm known for.

1168
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,300
So, it was, like, a challenge to myself.

1169
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:14,940
And...

1170
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,760
I guess, like, to...

1171
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,340
Like, just a challenge to myself as well.

1172
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,040
And to be see...

1173
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,860
To see if I could do it.

1174
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,420
If I could...

1175
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,820
If I'm able to do something like this.

1176
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,040
Do, like, uh...

1177
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,540
Um...

1178
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,080
Like, my own concert type deal.

1179
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,740
So...

1180
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,320
I do want...

1181
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,760
I mean, I...

1182
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,360
I would love to do something like the Phantom Thief concert again.

1183
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,900
Like, at an actual venue for concerts and stuff.

1184
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,140
Because, obviously, like, you know, it was at Anime Expo.

1185
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,000
Um...

1186
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So, like, obviously, the venue wasn't meant to be for, like, concerts.

1187
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,300
It was for panels and stuff.

1188
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:42,960
Um...

1189
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,120
But I would love to do it again.

1190
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,520
In an actual concert venue.

1191
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,120
And everything.

1192
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,300
But I'm glad people enjoy it.

1193
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,140
But apparently, from what I was told from my staff members, was that it was, like, fully packed.

1194
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:53,940
Um...

1195
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:57,640
And, like, if you guys see empty chairs, it's because some of them, like, moved to the front.

1196
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:58,680
Um...

1197
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,540
So, like, some...

1198
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,360
Like, there were, like, um...

1199
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,140
If there was, like, empty chairs, it's because some of them moved to the front to do, like, you know, chair on in the front.

1200
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,840
Like, with Watage and stuff like that.

1201
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:08,580
Um...

1202
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,300
But my staff members said that it was, like, a packed full room.

1203
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,000
Which I think was...

1204
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,520
I don't know.

1205
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,020
I think it was, like, a thousand...

1206
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,280
Six hundred...

1207
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,420
Plus, I believe.

1208
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:34,400
So, um, uh, so I think, I think it was a thousand six, I don't know, someone can fact check me, but, um, and, uh, my staff said, like, they had to turn some people away because, you know, fire marshal a lot.

1209
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,100
I'm just happy.

1210
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,140
I was like, I hope people count.

1211
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,320
I mean, it's free.

1212
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,860
I was like, that was all I wanted.

1213
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,240
I was like, I hope people come.

1214
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,060
Please, it's free.

1215
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,460
Like, it's a, oh, it was 1800.

1216
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,620
Holy shit.

1217
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,640
Okay, that's a lot more.

1218
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,480
It was, it was 1800 people there.

1219
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,240
So, I was like, oh my god, please, it's free.

1220
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,480
Please come.

1221
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,780
Um, please, I spent so much money.

1222
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:22,120
Oh yeah, I remember, like, Limu was asking me, I was like, so, like, um, do you get, like, money out of this, doing this?

1223
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,380
I was like, yeah, we, no.

1224
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:31,800
They were like, so, like, what's the benefit of doing the, this concert, like, doing this concert?

1225
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,420
Do you get, like, do you get paid?

1226
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,480
Or, like, did Anime Expo pay you?

1227
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:42,120
Or, like, um, um, or, or, or, like, like, what's the benefit?

1228
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,400
I was like, what do you mean?

1229
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,820
It came out of my own wallet.

1230
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,140
What do you mean I get paid?

1231
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,760
I'm paying this.

1232
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,880
I got, okay.

1233
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,640
That's why I was like, usually, like, what's the benefit?

1234
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,380
I was like, yeah, it's more so, like, for exposure, you know?

1235
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,480
Um, it's like, investing in myself.

1236
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,600
Um, yeah.

1237
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,260
Yeah, so how is this?

1238
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,260
Investing in myself, you know?

1239
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,600
Like, it's like, you know, it's like, advertisement.

1240
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:25,720
Just like, you know, maybe, like, some people who were normally never watched me before gets to, like, you know, enjoy, enjoy this concert.

1241
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,120
So, like, yeah, I did take the concert a little bit more seriously.

1242
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,080
I mean, I fucking sang in Japanese.

1243
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,680
How much serious can you get?

1244
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,230
I should post that much, this time around.

1245
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,010
Five figures to say, buy my merch is...

1246
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,190
Guys, I need to get my money back.

1247
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,830
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1248
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,610
After what I've spent...

1249
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,710
Oh yeah, by the way, I basically shilled my merch three separate times.

1250
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:17,170
Like, once in the intro, again at the end of the concert, and then like, the after credits scene.

1251
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,570
I shilled my merch again.

1252
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,230
I was like, please, please, please buy my merch, please.

1253
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,210
I said so.

1254
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,910
I really need people to buy my merch.

1255
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:27,710
Please...

1256
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:31,450
You gotta do what you gotta do.

1257
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,250
No, you'll understand tomorrow.

1258
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:34,610
I'll reveal it all.

1259
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,810
You'll understand tomorrow.

1260
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,150
I was like, guys, please.

1261
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,590
It's like, literally right there.

1262
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,470
Like, you can get it right now, please.

1263
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,950
Rodrigo, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

Thank you.

1265
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,930
Um, investing your own community always pays off.

1266
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,610
Thank you for everything you do for us, Toki.

1267
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:56,290
We love you so much.

1268
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,770
Thank you for the super chat, Rodrigo.

1269
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:58,470
Thank you, thank you.

1270
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,150
I'm really happy.

1271
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:02,510
Like, like I said, I know some guys are like, ah, FOMO!

1272
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:03,090
Ah!

1273
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,550
Um, but don't worry.

1274
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,610
It will be uploaded here.

1275
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,210
And I will add more stuff to the concert itself.

1276
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:17,530
Um, so that, um, so that, uh, you got like for those who waited, you know, get a bonus, something bonus for it, for it as well.

1277
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,330
Um, uh, but yeah.

1278
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:29,070
Um, yeah, like, I was told by my staff members that there was, uh, there was like a lot, you know how people are like subtle marketing, like, um, what was it called?

1279
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:37,410
Where like, you do like subtle marketing where it's like, just, they just like, do it like, where it's just like on your mind, but it's not like over and stuff like that.

1280
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,590
I don't, I just like be like, no, you have to buy.

1281
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,210
It's very, it's explicit marketing.

1282
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,270
There's no subliminal messaging here.

1283
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,530
It's all, it's very explicit on what I want you to do.

1284
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,650
What was I talking about earlier?

1285
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:04,370
I already forgot.

1286
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:06,250
Um, oh shit, two more minutes.

1287
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:13,450
Um, oh yeah, my staff said there were like lines for my booth, so thank you guys for those who are at Anime Expo.

1288
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,190

1289
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,210
Um, I really appreciate you guys doing that.

1290
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:19,310
Thank you.

1291
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,550
I'm glad that my aggressive, aggressive marketing is working.

1292
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,570
Oh my god!

1293
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,330
We're almost there.

1294
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:26,330
Two more minutes, guys.

1295
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,570
Oh, less than two more minutes.

1296
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,110
Next thing, thank you for the Akasupa.

1297
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,230
Thank you, thank you.

1298
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,450

00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,070
So glad I got to celebrate it with you at the concert.

1300
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,370

1301
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,110
Thank you.

1302
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,610

00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,270
Thank you guys so much.

1305
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:49,250
Oh my god.

1306
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,910
Um, I'm so nervous for my own birthday.

1307
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,630
It'll be the first time.

1308
00:58:55,970 --> 00:59:07,210
Like, I guess like technically like celebrating it on my own versus like in IRL, but like I'm glad to have you guys there for my birthday.

1309
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,730
I really do appreciate it.

1310
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:19,530
Um, I was like, you know, um, I very, I really appreciate you guys being there with me and um, spending your time with me for my special day.

1311
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,230
Oh my gosh, 20 seconds left.

1312
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,250
One more bite.

1313
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,420
Okay, you guys ready for a countdown?

1314
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,400
You guys ready?

1315
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:39,920
Oh my god, what the fu- Okay, it's on seven, six, five, oh wait, five, five, five, four, three, two, one!

1316
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,700
Whoa, yes!

1317
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,560
Dada!

1318
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,340
Yes!

1319
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,220
We're gonna have another outfit!

1320
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,140
It's tomorrow.

1321
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,440
It's gonna be tomorrow.

1322
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,880
Yes, back to back.

1323
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:40,600
This one is fully designed by my mama.

1324
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:48,540
So the swimsuit was a charity auction winner design.

1325
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,960
And it was designed by the charity auction winner and her friends.

1326
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,040
But the next one is designed fully.

1327
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,760
It's my outfit.

1328
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,960
That was also sort of from the charity.

1329
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:01,900
Actually, no.

1330
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,140
I think it was chat chooses.

1331
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,720
I think it was chat chooses the outfit topic.

1332
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,720
And then I mixed it together with school.

1333
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,800
So tomorrow we're doing another outfit reveal on my birthday.

1334
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,360
And it is school theme.

1335
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,020
Welcome back to school.

1336
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,180
You think summer...

1337
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,980
Summer vacation already ended.

1338
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,020
It's like, yay, beach episode!

1339
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,200
Now it's time to go back to school.

1340
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,960
Summer vacation is over already.

1341
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,860
We're going back to school now.

1342
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:45,460
Um...

1343
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,280
Um...

1344
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,160
Marty, thank you for the five gifts and shoes.

1345
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:50,540
Thank you.

1346
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,320
Thank you.

1347
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,040
Um...

1348
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,940
Thank you for the...

1349
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,600
Super chat.

1350
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:54,960
Thank you.

1351
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,460
Thank you.

1352
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,120
Birthday money.

1353
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,120
So technically getting today...

1354
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,800
I realized it was technically today because it's...

1355
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,320
Um...

1356
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,060
July 4th.

1357
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:03,740
So...

1358
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,680
Yes.

1359
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,860
For my birthday, we're gonna have a little...

1360
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,180
Another outfit reveal.

1361
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,520
And we're gonna have...

1362
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,820
Also another announcement!

1363
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,580
At the end of the stream.

1364
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,560
Um...

1365
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,480
The birthday stream itself won't be like super duper long.

1366
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:15,740
Don't worry.

1367
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,920
I'm not gonna do like a fucking...

1368
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,340
Six plus hour stream.

1369
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,920
On my birthday.

1370
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,240
Um...

1371
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,860
So...

1372
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,600
But...

1373
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,100
Um...

1374
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,920
Most likely the announcement will...

1375
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,820
It will be at...

1376
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,320
Uh...

1377
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:26,800
At the end.

1378
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,320
For tomorrow's stream as well.

1379
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,040
But...

1380
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,180
The particular theme for tomorrow's stream...

1381
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,400
Uh...

1382
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:31,560
Today.

1383
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:31,860
Sorry.

1384
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,160
I keep forgetting like it's midnight.

1385
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:33,800
Hahaha.

1386
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,220
Hahaha.

1387
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:37,540
Hahaha.

1388
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:37,980
For today.

1389
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,040
Um...

1390
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,000
Is a school outfit reveal.

1391
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,360
And the stream will be...

1392
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,460
Obviously it will be at...

1393
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,920
5pm PSD.

1394
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,500
Um...

1395
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,220
So be there.

1396
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,060
Be square.

1397
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:47,820
Whoa!

1398
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:48,840
Hahaha.

1399
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:50,540
Hahaha.

1400
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:50,760
Yes.

1401
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,880
Double the announcements.

1402
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,080
You guys are white knight now.

1403
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:55,600
Okay.

1404
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,340
So by the way.

1405
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:56,660
Okay.

1406
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,500
I have a story for you guys.

1407
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,320
About that.

1408
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,600
Outfit trailer.

1409
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,600
So this one wasn't done by my usual...

1410
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:03,620
Editor.

1411
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,000
Um...

1412
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,220
Because I was stupid.

1413
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,640
And I forgot to tell my editor.

1414
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,380
What...

1415
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,660
What date the outfit reveal was.

1416
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:13,760
Because...

1417
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,240
She was on vacation.

1418
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:16,680
Around...

1419
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:17,740
Um...

1420
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,580
The end of June.

1421
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,820
Like around end of June.

1422
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,860
So like...

1423
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,040
She was the one that didn't mind.

1424
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,860
She's my go-to person to do all my outfit teasers.

1425
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:25,720
So...

1426
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,000
All my outfit reveal teasers.

1427
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:27,920
So...

1428
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,420
Um...

1429
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:29,600
So she's done like, you know...

1430
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Even before times.

1431
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,300
Uh...

1432
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,700
She did all the...

1433
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,320
You might...

1434
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,680
Her style is very recognizable.

1435
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:35,740
Um...

1436
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:36,040
So...

1437
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,740
For this one, she also did my summer one as well.

1438
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,580
And...

1439
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:38,920
So...

1440
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,600
I forgot to...

1441
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,380
For me to do my...

1442
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,440
June and July outfit reveal.

1443
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:45,000
And she was like...

1444
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,100
Yeah.

1445
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:45,340
Yeah.

1446
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:45,920
I can do it.

1447
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,620
But then I forgot to tell her July's date.

1448
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,380
So she assumed it was...

1449
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,360
End of July.

1450
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,200
Or like...

1451
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,740
Middle of July.

1452
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,480
But I didn't tell her it was actually the beginning of July.

1453
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,720
And I didn't realize that.

1454
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:58,440
Um...

1455
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:58,820
She was like...

1456
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,880
Oh yeah, by the way, I'll be gone at the end of June.

1457
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,620
So I was just like...

1458
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:03,020
Oh...

1459
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:03,960
I was like, yeah, that's fine.

1460
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:04,880
And...

1461
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,140
Um...

1462
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:06,100
But I thought that...

1463
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,560
You know, she was working on it before then.

1464
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:08,420
So...

1465
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:08,800
Um...

1466
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,940
Literally, like...

1467
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,740
I think it was like...

1468
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,920
Two or...

1469
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,100
Three days...

1470
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,200
Before the...

1471
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,240
Before the stream.

1472
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,600
Yeah, three days before the stream.

1473
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,920
I messaged her.

1474
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:18,980
And be like...

1475
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,920
Oh, hey, like...

1476
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,740
How's the progress?

1477
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,420
And I was like...

1478
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,100
And then I like...

1479
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,300
Looked back our message history.

1480
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,740
And I was like...

1481
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,040
Wait, I never told her.

1482
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:31,580
I was like...

1483
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,400
I was like...

1484
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:32,820
I was looking through a message.

1485
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,400
I was like...

1486
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,060
Oh, fuck.

1487
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,400
I never told her.

1488
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,200
When it was.

1489
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,220
I was like...

1490
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:38,980
Java, thank you for the...

1491
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,000
Aka, aka, aka, aka.

1492
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:44,060
Thank you so much.

1493
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,920
Happy birthday, Doki.

1494
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,160
I don't really attend events on account of accounts.

1495
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,700
But I'm glad it helped offset the cost even just a little.

1496
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,520
Thank you.

1497
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,240
I really appreciate it.

1498
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,800
Thank you so much for the insane support.

1499
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:56,860
Thank you again.

1500
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,800
It means so much.

1501
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,900
Even though you can't attend the events.

1502
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,000
I hope that I still cheer you up by just streaming here as well.

1503
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,800
And doing the things I can do online.

1504
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,180
But thank you again, Java.

1505
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:07,980
Thank you.

1506
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:08,980
But yeah.

1507
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:09,280
Anyway.

1508
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,460
So I was like...

1509
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:11,440
My bad.

1510
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:15,100
I don't know if you've worked on it yet or not.

1511
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,840
But like...

1512
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,680
Do you think it can be done in time?

1513
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,580
And then I didn't hear anything.

1514
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,000
After half a...

1515
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,200
Like a day later.

1516
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,680
Almost a day later.

1517
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,740
I didn't hear anything.

1518
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,460
And that's why you saw me tweet out.

1519
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,140
Looking for emergency editor.

1520
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,780
Emergency commission.

1521
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,100
Like...

1522
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,520
Right?

1523
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,840
I...

1524
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,920
Like me to please.

01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:45,400
Looking for emergency motion graphics editor.

1526
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,540
That was basically it.

1527
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,540
That was the emergency.

1528
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,580
Um...

1529
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,960
Billy, thank you for the...

1530
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,100

Thank you.

1532
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,540
Thank you.

1533
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,080
Thank you.

1534
01:05:59,140 --> 01:05:59,700
Uh...

1535
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,580
So...

1536
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,040
Yeah.

1537
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,980
It was for the reveal trailer.

1538
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:05,300
Um...

1539
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,140
Then I was like...

1540
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:06,800
Oh, fuck.

1541
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,120
Oh, my God.

1542
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,280
I can't believe...

1543
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:09,740
I...

1544
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,000
Hannah...

1545
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,980
I forgot...

1546
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,780
To like tell her the dates.

1547
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:13,440
So...

1548
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,680
Huge shout-out...

1549
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,980
To the editor...

1550
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,480
For being able to do this within...

1551
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,400
Within...

1552
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:19,520
Like...

1553
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,060
I don't know.

1554
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,040
Um...

1555
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,500
I think like within like two days.

1556
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:24,640
So...

1557
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,560
Huge shout-out.

1558
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,020
Um...

1559
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,340
The editor was....

1560
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,900
Reyna Ilun!

1561
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,940
They done like...

1562
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,280
I think they done like music videos.

1563
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:31,780
I'm pretty sure...

1564
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,780
They were the ones that did like...

1565
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,640
Music videos for Kiara...

1566
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:34,820
Uh...

1567
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,320
For her songs and stuff like that.

1568
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,040
So...

1569
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:37,960
Can you shout out to her?

1570
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,680
She replied to my tweet, be like, I could do it.

1571
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,960
And I was like, oh, thank God.

1572
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,840
Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

1573
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,260
Thank you.

1574
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:46,900
Thank you.

1575
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,720
So they did that reveal trailer, the teaser.

1576
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,410
They did the reveal trailer in two days.

1577
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,050
Thank God.

1578
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:01,970
Shout out to her.

1579
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:06,950
I fucked up.

1580
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,350
I'm just glad they were able to do it.

1581
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,490
But yes, that is the announcement.

1582
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,130
I'll show it again for those who didn't see it.

1583
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,270
I'll show you guys the reveal trailer right now.

1584
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,270
So yeah, I'm super...

1585
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,910
Oh yeah, let me show you guys the silhouette too.

1586
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,510
Let me grab that real quick.

1587
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:55,750
Let me make sure I don't...

1588
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,130
What if I just accidentally leak my outfit right here?

1589
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,190
I'm going to do something I could do.

1590
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,030
I would have accidentally...

1591
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:05,430
Honestly, I won't be surprised if that's something I couldn't accidentally do.

1592
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:09,530
Okay.

1593
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:11,570
Let me make sure I don't do that.

1594
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:14,810
Okay.

1595
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,710
I'm just going to be like, what?

1596
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,190
The reveal is actually here.

1597
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,470
That's the secret announcement.

1598
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:27,210
Alright, let me grab the silhouette real quick for us.

1599
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:28,010
Alright.

1600
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:29,050
Okay.

1601
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,350
Alright, this is definitely...

1602
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:32,990
I double checked.

1603
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:33,790
This is the silhouette.

1604
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:34,270
Alright.

1605
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,450
Papa, thank you for the super chat.

1606
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:37,770
Thank you.

1607
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:38,230
Thank you.

1608
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,030
Tips on being the nerd goon.

1609
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,150
Doki shoves in the locker first.

1610
01:08:42,450 --> 01:08:43,930
Thank you for the super chat.

1611
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:44,350
Thank you.

1612
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:44,690
Thank you.

1613
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:45,030
Let me...

1614
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,830
Okay, I'm paranoid.

1615
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,410
Let me...

1616
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:47,030
Alright, here we go.

1617
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,310
Alright, so...

1618
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,950
This is the...

1619
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:51,850
This is the actual silhouette.

1620
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,610
I will tell you guys right now.

1621
01:08:54,390 --> 01:09:01,670
There is actually another toggle where I wear a different hoodie.

1622
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:02,910
So...

1623
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,190
Slash...

1624
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:05,970
Okay, I won't say hoodie.

1625
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:06,850
Let me jack it.

1626
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:07,950
So...

1627
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:10,290
It's obviously because there's a hood there.

1628
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,210
So like...

1629
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,390
So there is a different...

1630
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,690
There is a...

1631
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,910
Also a toggle where it becomes a different jacket slash hoodie.

1632
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,430
So I'll let you guys know that for now.

1633
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:23,190
Um...

1634
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:26,010
But yes, this is the silhouette for...

1635
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,010
I know, like...

1636
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,650
Back-to-back outfit reviews.

1637
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,590
I think this is like...

1638
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,770
This might be like the shortest, like...

1639
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,070
You know, from like no outfits to suddenly we have two...

1640
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:45,310
From waiting a year for the new outfit to suddenly waiting for like...

1641
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,310
Two to three weeks for the second one.

1642
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,070
I'm so bad.

1643
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:51,150
Because I was like...

1644
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,190
What do I do for my fucking birthday?

1645
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,650
I was like...

1646
01:09:58,650 --> 01:09:59,310
Um...

1647
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,110
So remember what I was telling you guys like...

1648
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,230
Oh wait, you guys didn't know.

1649
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:02,530
Okay.

1650
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:03,630
Um...

1651
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,710
Um...

1652
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,450
For those who don't know...

1653
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:07,870
Um...

1654
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,610
Obviously like...

1655
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:08,970
Celia.

1656
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:10,670
She's incredibly talented.

1657
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:12,070
And like obviously...

1658
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:12,530
You know...

1659
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:13,050
Everything...

1660
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,370
My movement and everything...

1661
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:15,070
For like...

1662
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,290
Um...

1663
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,210
Rigging for...

1664
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:16,830
Skinsuits.

1665
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,770
She's incredibly...

1666
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,310
Uh...

1667
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:21,950
We had a good run.

1668
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:24,390
Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

1669
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:24,750
Thank you.

1670
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:25,430
Thank you.

1671
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,570
Um...

1672
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,610
No, this was done by...

1673
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:29,150
This is also done by Celia.

1674
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:30,870
But for those who don't know...

1675
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,390
But she's like...

1676
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,170
Obviously she's like...

1677
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,330
Incredibly busy.

1678
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:40,530
And everything, because, like, there's so many of us that... And, like, her work is, like, obviously, her work is insane.

1679
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:49,910
Like, she... Like, I don't know if you guys saw all her tweets about, like... About, like, how many, like... Like, how much is done for her rigs and everything.

1680
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,350
For the skin suits.

1681
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:59,070
And, um... And so, like... Because of that, because she has so many, like, you know, people... She has so many kids.

1682
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:04,230
Uh... We all... Obviously, we all want her to do our rigging.

1683
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:10,510
Um... So, now there is, uh... Uh... There is a limit to, like... So, like, everybody has, like, an equal chance.

1684
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,610
Uh... To, like, you know, have something new from her.

1685
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:17,110
Um... So, we're all limited to, like... One outfit.

1686
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,250
Or, like, one new... One new outfit per year.

1687
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:21,850
Um... I'm greedy.

1688
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:22,470
I got two.

1689
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:29,890
I... I... I... I... I got there before the limit was set.

1690
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:37,590
I... I... I... I basically... I grabbed... I got there before she set the limit.

1691
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,690
I was, like... I was, like... I'm greedy.

1692
01:11:39,690 --> 01:12:06,810
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Um,

1693
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:11,950
I might, because I do have a lot of outfit ideas that I really want to do now.

1694
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,910
So I might, um, maybe like one or two outfits.

1695
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:20,610
If I do have another outfit this year, it will be, the rigging will be done by someone else.

1696
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,050
Because I'm, I'm fucking greedy.

1697
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:36,290
But, but I already, I already booked a slot with Celia for like, for next year's, um, for next year.

1698
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,250
Like, uh, uh, uh, outfit.

1699
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,970
So, like, I already booked a slot for like, January, 2026.

1700
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:46,050
Because I was, I'm, I want more!

1701
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,010
The game doesn't stop.

1702
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,590
I want more!

1703
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:52,790
Feed me!

1704
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,210
Feed me!

1705
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,710
Dookie's stocks go up.

1706
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:06,230
Yes, but I do have some inciting, exciting stuff.

1707
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,390
To show you guys, tomorrow, today.

1708
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:09,110
Sorry, today.

1709
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:10,830
I keep forgetting that it's July 4th.

1710
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:11,770
Happy birthday to me!

1711
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,790
Yippee!

1712
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,470
Uh, ha ha ha ha ha.

1713
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:16,730
Feed me to see more.

1714
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,590
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1715
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:26,470
Um, um, but I am, uh, uh, So, I want to know what.

1716
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:27,890
Happy birthday, Dookie!

1717
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,170
I'm disappointed in you.

1718
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:31,370
You didn't do well in your map test.

1719
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,830
Be my, oh my god.

1720
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,510
If I get B minus on map, that's a win on my book.

1721
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,330
So, I'm punishing you with a happy face.

1722
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,970
Thank you for the super chat.

1723
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:41,990
Thank you, thank you.

1724
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:42,910
I don't know about you.

1725
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,130
That's a win.

1726
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,350
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1727
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,210
That's a pass.

1728
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:48,290
I take this.

1729
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:49,970
Ha ha ha ha.

1730
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,030
Ha ha ha.

1731
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:52,210
Ha ha ha.

1732
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,510
Um, yeah, I'm looking forward to, I'm really excited for today.

1733
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,350
I have so many special things planned.

1734
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:04,410
But yeah, that's why I have the, the back-to-back outfit reveals.

1735
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:09,150
Because I was like, what do I do for my, he's like, what's really difficult?

1736
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:13,670
Is that, this was before the concert, by the way.

1737
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:23,470
Anyway, this was before I got the, the, um, the, the concert deal with Anime Expo.

1738
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:27,450
Um, or the concert deal at Anime Expo.

1739
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:31,690
So, I was like, what do, what the fuck do I do for my birthday?

1740
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,010
Sorry.

1741
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:43,770
Um, I had, I'm eating my bentaco udon.

1742
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,150
So, um.

1743
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,710
Some of the, the fish eggs got stuck in the back of my throat.

1744
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:53,570
So, it's like, irritating it.

1745
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,680
Let me hydrate.

1746
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,080
Real quick.

1747
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:01,500
Ah!

1748
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,560
Guys, there's no way I can choke on fucking fish eggs.

1749
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,800
They're so tiny.

1750
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,600
It's just irritating on my throat right now.

1751
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:14,380
Hmm.

1752
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:22,240
I was like, if I choke on figs, fish eggs, we have bigger problems.

1753
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:25,820
Hmm.

1754
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:31,320
Um.

1755
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,440
Wait, what was I talking about?

1756
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:33,560
Fuck!

1757
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:34,800
Right.

1758
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,360
My mind is all over the place.

1759
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,320
Cough, cough, cough, cough.

1760
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,060
That is just irritating my throat.

1761
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,910
Um.

1762
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:52,310
Guys, what was I talking about?

1763
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:53,610
Cough, cough, cough.

1764
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,540
I like how I'm choking, and I'm still eating.

1765
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,780
Oh yeah, birthday!

1766
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,500
Um...

1767
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,680
So, um...

1768
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,540
Oh my... God, it's still stuck.

1769
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:36,610
Sorry, I have to like blow my nose too.

1770
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,410
But anyway, so...

1771
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,590
The outfit was planned before the concert was...

1772
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,730
You know, before we had the concert idea.

1773
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,770
So I was like, you know, I was like, what the fuck do I do for my birthday?

1774
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:55,470
So the hardest part about my birthday stuff, or like any event stuff...

1775
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:57,570
Is that...

1776
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,090
I keep one-upping myself.

1777
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:01,270
Like...

1778
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:07,270
I need to stop doing all these creative big events every time on these...

1779
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:12,010
Goddamn birthdays, anniversaries, and stuff like that.

1780
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,370
Because I keep...

1781
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:16,290
I keep making some crazy shit for all that.

1782
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:17,510
Because it was so hard.

1783
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,310
I was like, the fuck do I do on my birthday?

1784
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:20,590
Like...

1785
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,070
And I was like, you know what?

1786
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,150
I haven't...

1787
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,990
I haven't done a...

1788
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:28,330
I haven't done an outfit reveal yet for my birthday.

1789
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:29,430
So we'll just do that.

1790
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:32,090
I know it's a lot simpler than my...

1791
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,970
My birthdays in the past.

1792
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:38,110
I've done some crazy shit for like birthdays and anniversaries.

1793
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:40,210
But like...

1794
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:41,610
So...

1795
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:42,350
I know like...

1796
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:45,670
It's not really an escalation on like...

1797
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,650
Stuff I've done in the...

1798
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:48,150
I've done a concert in a concert.

1799
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:48,810
I did...

1800
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:49,750
I did...

1801
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,810
That's the escalation...

1802
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:51,570
I did too...

1803
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:53,790
But this is like actual like concert concert.

1804
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:54,810
Like...

1805
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,230
Like...

1806
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:57,990
That was the bonus escalation.

1807
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,130
Uh...

1808
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,650
The power creep.

1809
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:01,490
So...

1810
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,330
So yes...

1811
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,650
That's why we're having another outfit reveal.

1812
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:06,530
Um...

1813
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:09,090
For my birthday.

1814
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:09,830
I know like...

1815
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:11,070
We just had summer vacation.

1816
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,550
We just had our beach episode.

1817
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,090
But it's like...

1818
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,130
It's like we're going by...

1819
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,550
Anime time frame.

1820
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:18,290
Like we have one beach episode.

1821
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,830
And now...

1822
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:19,830
And then it's back to school.

1823
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:23,510
So...

1824
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,190
So...

1825
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:25,170
That's why...

1826
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,210
Now one...

1827
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:29,150
One beach episode.

1828
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:31,050
And now it's back to the school time.

1829
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:32,490
That filler arc is over.

1830
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:33,150
Uh...

1831
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:35,090
I've never had it back.

1832
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:39,430
Um...

1833
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:41,470
But yeah, I do have like...

1834
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:42,830
More stuff I want to tell you guys.

1835
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,430
About...

1836
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,070

1837
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:44,710
And like...

1838
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,150

1839
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:46,210

1840
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:48,050

1842
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:50,050

Hey guys!

01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,090
I'm gonna call it here.

1883
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:32,930
I'm tired.

1884
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:33,710
I'm eepy.

1885
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:36,050
This was...

1886
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:36,750
This was...

1887
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,890
It was a very...

1888
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:39,810
Very, very long day...

1889
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:40,470
For me today.

1890
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:41,730
Um...

1891
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:42,010
Like...

1892
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:42,350
It started...

1893
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:43,910
I literally woke up at...

1894
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,970
Three in the morning.

1895
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,970
Because I had to be awake...

1896
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,290
To be...

1897
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:48,510
Go back to back...

1898
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,190
With...

1899
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:50,810
The...

1900
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:51,450
Production team.

1901
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:52,650
Um...

1902
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:53,670
For the...

1903
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:54,130
Uh...

1904
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:55,210
3D concert.

1905
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,270
So like...

1906
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:57,190
I've been up since like...

1907
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:58,270
Three in the morning.

1908
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:00,150
And then I've only had like...

1909
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:00,990
Miniature naps.

1910
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:02,190
Here and there.

1911
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:02,710
So I had like...

1912
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:03,250
Three hours sleep.

1913
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:04,550
And then I've had like...

1914
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,510
Miniature naps...

1915
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,250
Throughout the day.

1916
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,270
So I...

1917
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,750
Like...

1918
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,910
We're cutting it so close by the way.

1919
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:10,790
Like...

1920
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,490
Everything was like...

1921
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:13,810
Cut so fucking close.

1922
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:14,470
I...

1923
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,890
Oh my god.

1924
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,330
I did so much traveling for this...

1925
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:17,190
God damn...

1926
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:17,650
Concert.

1927
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:18,570
I mean...

1928
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:20,350
Like...

1929
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:20,790
Like...

1930
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,430
When I tell you guys the price of the concert itself.

1931
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:23,850
It does not include like...

1932
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,970
The traveling fee.

1933
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,450
The mixing fee.

1934
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:27,210
For everything.

1935
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,430
Um...

1936
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,530
Like...

1937
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:31,150
It did not...

1938
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:31,330
It...

1939
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:31,710
Like...

1940
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,370
Oh my god.

1941
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:33,290
I...

1942
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:35,030
The...

1943
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,030
Let's dance lessons too.

1944
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:38,350
Oh...

1945
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:39,030
My god.

1946
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,670
It was so much money.

1947
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:41,610
It was...

1948
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,090
Also...

1949
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:44,850
Um...

1950
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:45,830
I tweeted about it.

1951
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:46,290
But...

1952
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:47,610
I know some people were like...

1953
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:47,910
Oh yeah.

1954
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:49,490
Some people were like...

1955
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:50,950
What was the last song?

1956
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:51,630
Um...

1957
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,330
In the set list.

1958
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,590
That was actually...

1959
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,030
A preview.

1960
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:54,850
Well...

1961
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,310
I mean...

1962
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:55,590
It's...

1963
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:56,370
Technically finished.

1964
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:57,090
But like...

1965
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,010
This was like...

1966
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,790
Recorded...

1967
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,610
It's super fast.

1968
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,050
Versus like...

1969
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,310
Natural stereo recording.

1970
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,150
But...

1971
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,490
It was basically a concert version...

1972
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:08,130
Of...

1973
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,110
My original song.

1974
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:10,210
Um...

1975
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:10,630
So...

1976
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,590
For those who didn't...

1977
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:13,790
Were watching the recordings of it...

1978
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:14,130
Um...

1979
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:14,590
Like the...

1980
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,130
The convention recordings...

1981
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:16,790
Um...

1982
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:17,970
Of the concert itself.

1983
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,050
That was...

1984
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,530
The last song was actually...

1985
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:20,830
A preview...

1986
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,410
Of my original song.

1987
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:23,470
So that's why...

1988
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:23,970
People were like...

1989
01:21:23,970 --> 01:21:24,790
What the fuck was...

1990
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:25,370
Is she singing?

1991
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:30,610
So...

1992
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:31,070
So yeah.

1993
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:31,910
Hey guys.

1994
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,510
Um...

1995
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:34,350
Well I don't know when...

1996
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:35,870
The original song will actually be...

1997
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:36,170
Out Out.

1998
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:37,790
Because I haven't had the...

1999
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:39,530
Music video...

2000
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:39,790
Like...

2001
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:40,550
Figured out yet.

2002
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:41,110
Um...

2003
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:42,110
I haven't contacted anybody...

2004
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,070
For...

2005
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:43,750
The music video.

2006
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:44,550
So...

2007
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:46,010
The MV is the one that takes the longest.

2008
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:46,490
I...

2009
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:47,110
I feel like.

2010
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:48,750
MV is always the longest...

2011
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:49,210
That's...

2012
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:49,690
That...

2013
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,190
That will take.

2014
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:51,090
So...

2015
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,010
Um...

2016
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:52,810
So now...

2017
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:53,570
It's more so like...

2018
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:54,410
We're just waiting on...

2019
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:55,950
Me figuring out the music video situation.

2020
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,070
Um...

2021
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:00,590
Um...

2022
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:00,650
Um...

2023
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:00,830
But yes.

2024
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:01,530
I don't know when...

2025
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,810
The original song...

2026
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,350
Regarding the official release for it...

2027
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:04,770
Will be done.

2028
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,370
But...

2029
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:05,770
Yeah.

2030
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:06,290
So...

2031
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:06,430
Like...

2032
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:07,830
At least you get something out of it.

2033
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,210
Like...

2034
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:09,050
At least you get to hear it.

2035
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:11,810
And...

2036
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:12,750
As always everybody...

2037
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,650
I'm gonna call it here.

2038
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,210
Because...

2039
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:15,770
I can be rested for it...

2040
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:16,150
Later today.

2041
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:17,830
As always everybody...

2042
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:18,750
Stay hydrated.

2043
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:19,730
Posture check.

2044
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:21,390
Oh my god.

2045
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,410
Wait let me...

2046
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,630
I need to stay hydrated.

2047
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:24,110
Oh my god.

2048
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:25,450
That mentaco is like...

2049
01:22:25,450 --> 01:22:26,090
Fucking me up.

2050
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,390
But...

2051
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:35,970
Thank you again...

2052
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:36,570
For...

2053
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:38,310
Coming to my countdown stream.

2054
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,750
I hope you guys had a great time.

2055
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,030
Hang out with me today.

2056
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,490
I know like...

2057
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:42,870
You know...

2058
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:44,110
I wish I could stream longer.

2059
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:46,510
But the longest stream will be for my actual birthday stream.

2060
01:22:46,650 --> 01:22:47,510
This is just a countdown.

2061
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,310
Anyway guys...

2062
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,790

2065
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,270
I showed the...

2066
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:52,890
Announcement trailer.

2067
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:53,890
Revealed...

2068
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:54,430

2069
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:56,030
Outfit debut trailer again.

2070
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:57,350
Um...

2071
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,690
To end the stream.

2072
01:22:58,910 --> 01:22:59,770
But as always everybody...

2073
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:00,430
Stay hydrated.

2074
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,350
Posture check.

2075
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:02,270
Get up and move around.

2076
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:03,270
To get that blood flowing.

2077
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,570
And if you stay up for me...

2078
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,230
Head to bed.

2079
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,010
Because...

2080
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,870
You deserve it.

2081
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,510
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2082
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:09,690

01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:10,950
