1
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,920
Rebels!

2
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,280
She started so early!

3
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,220
Oh my god, a full five minutes early!

4
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,100
Oh my god!

5
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
What's so wild.

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,060
Anyway, guys, hello everybody and welcome to the early access of season five for Marvel Rivals.

7
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,960
A huge shout out again to Marvel Rivals for sponsoring me on today's stream.

8
00:02:13,340 --> 00:03:19,840
I am the VTuber representation for the early access amongst all the fleshy's that will be streaming it today so um yay yippee i really am very honored to be chosen um to uh to be the show the early access showcase for the vtuber side uh it really does mean a lot um anyway for this don't know your uh marvel revival season five will be launching on november 14th um gambit is the new hero for this season or not this season next season technically next season in like days so um it will be gambit yes we are all very surprised that he is a support character um i don't think anyone expected that not even me because you know we also see gambit as like you know sort of like dps you know because he has like cards does explosions and stuff like that yeah i think a lot of us expected to dps dps so everyone was like oh man another dps and then guango was like psych support like jokes on you Support!

9
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah, explosives.

10
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,800
The most supportive skill.

11
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Yeah.

12
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,020
So, so no one expected that.

13
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,460
And it was a very nice surprise.

14
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,140
But yeah, you guys didn't know.

15
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,760
This game basically has updates almost every month, which is crazy.

16
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,480
Not like a hero every month is crazy.

17
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,960
And I think you guys might know season 5.5 would be rogue because it's based on Gambit and Rogue since they're married.

18
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,020
Everything so I'm surprised.

19
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,680
I don't think they're I don't think rogue's gonna be another support But my theory is okay, you're gonna see this.

20
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm gonna show the trailer and I think My theory is that she's gonna be a tank because in the trailer You see right next to Emma and they are the same size.

21
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,040
I was like oh my gambit bro Bro man you scored bro.

22
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:50,660
He just wants to be crushed by giant women like bit one bro like yeah yeah so we're gonna watch uh a trailer two trailers real quick um i did watch them before but we'll blind react to them again not blind sorry i'll react to it again because like it's funny everyone's like when was the trailer dropped because no one you know everyone expected to be last week so if you guys didn't watch the trailer um here is the trailer choice but not a doubt moment yeah because like wolverine's like oh you should like look at look at driving the motorcycle.

23
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,260
Bro.

24
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,860
Okay, look at this.

25
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,880
This is why I think Rogue is going to be a tank because she's bigger than Emma.

26
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,480
Like, she's literally bigger than Emma.

27
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,680
So I feel like she has to be a tank because there's no way they're releasing two supports at the same time.

28
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,060
Yeah, and Magneto's in the shot, too.

29
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,280
Like, all the two tank players are there.

30
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,740
Just lucky motherfucker.

31
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,460
He's she's a but she has to be a muscle mommy.

32
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,860
I I she has to be a tank.

33
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,080
There's no way I don't think it'll release two some like two supports in a row.

34
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,100
That's way too wild Making gambit a support is already a lot.

35
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,460
Also, I can't really try to make Loki and Mantis his cannon in the Marvel Ravos Universe.

36
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,200
Oh my god, there's Cyclops

37
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,490
They released two DPS before yes, but DPS players are greedy

38
00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:23,210
supports supports will take anything they could get DPS players are greedy as hell all right and then here is the gambit trailer oh yes there he is I have tried gambit a little bit upstream because I have to like you know prepare everything to make sure everything works and he is so overwhelming as support you guys will understand the moment I show you guys his util you will understand he is so he is very Like there is a lot of,

39
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:31,070
I swear to God, if I see a raccoon player, that's not me, that's trying to play this character, it's GG's.

40
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:43,370
Like, I do not believe in my cloak slash raccoon player to pick up Gambit because I looked at Gambit and I was like, oh my, you have to know resource management very well.

41
00:06:45,710 --> 00:07:52,510
yeah if i know if i see a cloak main or a rocket man trying to pick up this guy it's it's ggs he is very high maintenance yeah of course he's he knows french he's always known french guys he's always known french someone was like why is there french music i'm like because gambit speaks french he always goes like mon ami it's been that way until the end of time um it's very oh yeah apparently for um um the voice actors for gambit and rogue they've been the they got the people they got for gambit and rogue they've always voice acted them uh well not the rogue the last time the voice actress did rogue she did the marvel versus capcon um um and she like and then like she came back to voice her again but i know that gambit person the one who does gambit he's been voicing gambit for years basically for almost every like iteration of him so I thought that was really cool that they got them um because a lot of the other voice actors they're like new voice actors for these characters but for

42
00:07:52,510 --> 00:09:05,650
Gambit and Rogue um they've been getting they got like the reoccurring voice actors yeah um but anyway alright let's go check let me make sure uh alright let's look at Gambit and the battle pass the real content alright um also like for those who don't know they buffed a lot of things they joined zero things and buffed everything so like i need you guys to give me a list of what to check up because i looked at the the rivals list and i was like i don't know it was like seven plus characters and i was just like i don't know i can't keep track of it i need you guys to tell me what to check out i was like that's a lie that's like i can count to three that's it um all right let's see oh yeah but here's the new skin for oh no game audio all right here you go here's the new skin for gambit pretty cool pretty neat yeah i already bought it by the way also magnino gets everything goddamn he also gets a new skin there's like his highlight intro i i honestly i don't know the default one is such a

43
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:42,870
classic it's just the problem with me and new skins it looks so cool but like when i look at like classic like marvel characters like gambit it's so hard to go from default because it's such a classic design so it's it's so difficult i don't care about magneto though you can be in whatever skin he wants but his classic one is so iconic so it's so hard for me to swap anyway so um namor gets a powdered skin it's like um i like that it's sort of like pious pious of the caribbean And he looks like Davy Jones.

44
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,690
Yeah, it's like...

45
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,990
Yeah, it's like Davy Jones.

46
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,870
I like that.

47
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,630
And then there's his emote for it.

48
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,370
Davy Jones Locker.

49
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,530
And then there's the pilot intro.

50
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,720
Ooh, that looks sick.

51
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,100
I like how his crew is actually just like...

52
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,080
It's just an octopus.

53
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Like, why are you wearing an odd patch?

54
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,660
Why are you wearing an odd patch?

55
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:41,660
Oh yeah, I was so surprised that I was surprised that Groot doesn't have the guardian skin I thought because everyone has a guardian skin except for Groot But they gave him that now Look at that Look He has his little plane Here comes the airplane Yeah Naked Groot is peak Groot Um Uh,

56
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,640

Thank you.

60
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,200

61
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,780

64

There's the Frankenstein.

65
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:52,980
Wait.

66
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,240
There's Frankenstein Punisher.

67
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,040
That's what it called.

68
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,460
Frankencastle.

69
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,120
And then there's.

70
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,360
I think the highlight intro is cool as fuck though.

71
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,580
No.

72
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:05,940
Okay.

73
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,660
The highlight is really cool.

74
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,880
I like the highlight intro.

75
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,580
I think it's cool that he's like bursting out of the TV.

76
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:14,820
Okay.

77
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,520
And then, okay, blue...

78
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,900
I remember I saw this.

79
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,240
I was like, it's thing, but he's blue.

80
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,140
It's perfect.

81
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,600
And this one is from...

82
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
I think this one has to be from the movie.

83
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,260
We're in the fantastic...

84
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,640
Why are he's blue?

85
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,500
It's like a blue rock.

86
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,540
Yeah, I...

87
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,380
Okay, it's a good skin, but I have a feeling...

88
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,220
Okay, unless it's the...

89
00:11:45,240 --> 00:12:52,980
which one was it it's the ultron cricoa map because that one's pretty blue but like i feel like in any other map i can see where he is like 80 miles away he's so blue bro what if he was blue though oh yeah wait it's from what if guys it first appears when what if what if the thing were blue so it's just like bro guys what if he was blue guys just what if oh yeah this one i was like this one was a surprise because like oh yeah um basically she is a dps healer now she can shoot people to heal and then um i was like i was like that's cool she can be like a third support and then like and now sinking like we all know widow mains aren't even gonna shoot someone I feel like widow mains aren't even gonna bother shooting someone even if they have the like even though they have the ability to I don't think like real widow maize will even try wait

90
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:52,960
yeah she can out heal ultrons now she can actually out heal ultron which is crazy um but yeah I was I was not expecting this because I was like it did not look like widow yeah it's is healing like what is this a d someone picking widow is not here to heal she is not here for healing okay and then like there's white hella it's a very clean skin the skin is pretty clean that's her 60 i didn't realize in the 60s she looks like that is i never expect her to have blue hair i've always like associated red hair with widow oh this one's sick i was not expecting Angela she turned into a furry I was surprised it just didn't have this was like not like a uh what is it like a full legendary skin oh

91
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:40,440
that's crazy I was not expecting this like oh she has furry abs like that's how ripped she is like because fur is supposed to hide the abs when you look at the tiger you don't see like abs but like she's so jacked up that even the fur can't cover the abs yeah oh yeah and also damn like right here she built like a brick like a brick house yeah god damn all right and then there's oh yeah this one's i this one's really clean.

92
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,400

Yeah, this Ultron is sick.

99
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,610

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,500
Oh, I can't get it.

144
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
But yeah, Spider-Man also has a new skin and everything.

145
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,100
I think that's all the cosmetics and everything.

146
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,880
Let me double check.

147
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
Oh yeah, there's new accessories too.

148
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,480
So everyone has new accessories too.

149
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,920
I mean, I guess I could buy it.

150
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,660
I mean, I have the money.

151
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,260
So extra.

152
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,540
I normally never equip these.

153
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,860
Because, like, for me, it's, like, I find it.

154
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,960
Like, I personally, like, don't like equipping them.

155
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,440
But, um, but I'll do it for today.

156
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,040
For early access for those who want to see it.

157
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,160
Oh, my God.

158
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,240
He has this little alligator.

159
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah, he has a little one-of-a-kind music player.

160
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,620
Uh, yeah, they have a little...

161
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,800
I know they do a little effect.

162
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
They, like, cheer you on and stuff when you get a kill.

163
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,060
Because I know...

164
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,320
Oh!

165
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,980
Wolverine is the his daughter.

166
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,120
Okay, that's cute.

167
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,600
I like that Wolverine is his daughter.

168
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,560
All right, let's go.

169
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,100
Oh, yeah.

170
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,400
Oh, I can't go to the I can't go to time square yet, guys.

171
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,140
That's when we hang out with the other streamers.

172
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,500
All right, let me check what time do we go to town's time square.

173
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,240
Okay, we have plenty of time.

174
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,540
All right.

175
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,020
All right.

176
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,920
Gambit.

177
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,320
Okay.

178
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,800
I'll let you guys look.

179
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Okay.

180
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,200
So all right.

181
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,620
I will be left side jokie just for this.

182
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, yeah, for sorry.

183
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,340
I forgot to show.

184
00:19:44,360 --> 00:20:59,460
you guys this real quick too um the lord icon i know some people want no one knows about the lord icon so where is he there he is so um he has a four star which you know we all know why he's a four star right so this is a defawe we already saw the mvp though but we all know why he's a four star it's it's it's a lot uh there's some of his emotes and then his other one where he gets to scroll out and everything whoa okay so um you don't see any of this yet but i will show you why i'm like so this is his lord icon right here default lord default lord all right i'll show you why he is very overwhelming to play and i shall be left side doki so you guys can all see the hundreds of cooldowns you got resource management you gotta do um i think like when you get obviously when you get a hang of it then it won't be as difficult but like it's still like it was a lot it was it was a lot all right so you see this you see the four cards in front of you So,

185
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:18,760
obviously, he can do damage on his primary And then he can also heal So, he can do damage like that And then he can heal here, like, like that So, like, here, I'll show you This is once, there's page one And then there's page two

186
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:31,240
There's page one and page two So, uh, God, he's so cool Pottence and thank you for the Twitch Prime.

187
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:31,540
Thank you.

188
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,120
Thank you.

189
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,280
So I'm surprised he's not five stars.

190
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,760
So um it's time to read guys.

191
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,120
So what's cool about this is that he does have he does have this dash thing.

192
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,820
You guys see that?

193
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,540
And the thing about that is that you can dash anywhere.

194
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,360
But without the dash it's just a right click like this.

195
00:21:49,800 --> 00:22:22,260
So you can do that without the dash but obviously you can do normal dash too so it does damage when you do the combo um so like if i want to do a combo it'll be like it'll be like what was it okay what is it was like like that so you have to do shift right-click so you can do damage with that um like that but the thing is you can do it you can do like a double dash anywhere wherever you're facing and everything but there's a cooldown obviously i have no

196
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:55,300
so let me put the cooldowns on so the thing is i do this e i press e um i get regen with that but then i can also heal people if i press e and f it's a cleanse so if you know if a bucky ocean i just do that i can't do it yet because my cards and then and then do that okay they're dead they're dead but but if they were alive it would have worked so e e f It's a cleanse,

197
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,040
but it's okay.

198
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,080
I can't do anything right now because I don't have cards.

199
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:09,540
So, but if I have, yeah, it can counter, basically, he can, you know, if a Bucky ult's in and there's like a red thing, yeah, it's basically a cleanse.

200
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,200
So I have to press E and F, but I have to recharge my cards.

201
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
The cards charge passively.

202
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,400
But the thing is, I don't have to use it right away.

203
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,080
So you see the cards around me?

204
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,300
I get faster regen if I have it around me.

205
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,340
But if I do this, it cleanses people.

206
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,920
Yeah.

207
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,000
It can cleanse.

208
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,680
Yeah, in his...

209
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,740
Yeah, so...

210
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,000
If I press F, if I press F, it does damage.

211
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,580
So, and then if I press F, F...

212
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,480
Okay, I don't have my cards.

213
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,740
See, this is the annoying part.

214
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,340
It does anti-heal.

215
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,420
FF does anti-heal.

216
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,660
Yeah, cleanse it removes debuffs.

217
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,100
So any debuffs you get, I can just cleanse it with E.

218
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah.

219
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,560
So if I do FF...

220
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,620
Like, F button, and then F again?

221
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
There's anti-heal.

222
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,220
But it doesn't...

223
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,580
And then if I do...

224
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,320
F, E, it boops them up.

225
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,120
But I don't have a card.

226
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,800
Give me a sec.

227
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,540
I don't...

228
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,720
Oh my god.

229
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,920
This is the worst part.

230
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,900
It just...

231
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
That's why I'm saying research management.

232
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,860
I have to wait.

233
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,280
I have to wait until I have my cards.

234
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,740
Okay, I need two cards, basically.

235
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
F, E.

236
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,480
It knocks people up.

237
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,320
like that.

238
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,000
It ricochets them.

239
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,840
Yeah, I have to count my cards.

240
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,340
Don't tell the casino, guys.

241
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
Don't tell them.

242
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,920
There's no... It's passive.

243
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,780
You have to build your thing passively.

244
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,860
So, yeah, wait.

245
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,660
That's why it's like...

246
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,920
The thing is, you have that... He seems... You might think in theory, he seems... It's not.

247
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,360
It's not.

248
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,780
Because, like, it gets overwhelming.

249
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,160
Because then obviously you can't spam it because you have to... You passively build your cards.

250
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,240
Um...

251
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,020
Yeah, the cards have a cooldown.

252
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,620
And the thing is, you see I can have it up?

253
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,240
I get increased damage boost.

254
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,440
Um, I get, like, more damage if I have the cards out.

255
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, E is the, E is heal.

256
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,460
Okay, I heal you.

257
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,680
And it goes, you can see it, you can see the cards bouncing back and forth.

258
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,320
It bounces back and forth.

259
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,420
So I can do a line, and I do this.

260
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,720
And it heals, like, back and forth, too.

261
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,120
Yeah.

262
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,800
So, there's no headshots, though.

263
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,560
There's no headshots.

264
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,040
for this.

265
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,840
Yeah, and then boop.

266
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Wait.

267
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,380
Or is it shift?

268
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,080
Okay, shift.

269
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
It's shift right click.

270
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,440
Shift right click makes it so that you can... Yeah.

271
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,160
Does it cleanse blade anti-heal?

272
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,480
I assume it does.

273
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I'm pretty sure it does.

274
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,160
Yeah, it's very... It's a lot.

275
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,440
And also his... His other... It's so cool.

276
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,480
His other... Basically, it does speed boost.

277
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
Speed boost and people can charge up faster.

278
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,220
So, um...

279
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:02,540
So, it's AoE, and everyone that I see, everyone that I see gets all charged, too.

280
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,360
And they jump, too.

281
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,340
They jump higher, too.

282
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,420
So, they all jump higher.

283
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,900
They have speed boost, and they build up faster.

284
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,760
It's too complicated going back to the jab.

285
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,540
As I'm saying, this is why I say if I see a close player or a rocket player playing Gambit, I know this is not for you, because even I'm so confused.

286
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,540
Guys, it took...

287
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,460
If I did not try out Gambit last night before today, I would not know what I was doing.

288
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,100
I had to, like, pre-try Gambit to figure out what the heck I'm doing.

289
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,460
Because I was so...

290
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,080
I was so overloaded.

291
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,420
It's like...

292
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,220
It's a lot of clicking.

293
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,160
It's a lot.

294
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,460
So, like, the thing is, I have...

295
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,540
Yeah, so...

296
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,580
He has more than four moves.

297
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,440
Exactly.

298
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,520
He has more than four moves.

299
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:52,720
moves.

300
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,920
I can't take that.

301
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,540
Cool.

302
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,740
Thank you for the Twitch prize.

303
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,080
Thank you.

304
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Thank you.

305
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,020
Yeah, he's balanced around his card.

306
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,940
If I have this out, I get regen technically.

307
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,200
I get regen.

308
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,480
See?

309
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:08,880
You see?

310
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,680
I just have... Okay, so you see this?

311
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,680
If I never put my card... If I don't use it, I get regen.

312
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,340
I also get regen from using E.

313
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,180
But, like, you can have your cards out so you can have...

314
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:53,280
your regen stuff yeah yeah you do that it's like shift right click so it's it's it's yeah anyway let's try out the new team ups guys okay team up tab all right what are the new ones all right so in jet light when hawk eye uses enemies hit or launch back and blade wave filled with light energy sweeps this wave passes through both it heals and boosts healing all right let's try this out i don't know what that means All right,

315
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,100
where is that?

316
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,680
Is this?

317
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,820
It's not that.

318
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,220
Oh, it was shift.

319
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,260
Sorry, I let him die.

320
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,440
Don't worry.

321
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,200
Don't worry.

322
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,360
I don't play Hawkeye.

323
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,580
There we go.

324
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,280
I healed him.

325
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,260
Guys, I'm a hero.

326
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,960
There we go, guys.

327
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,260
I'm a hero.

328
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,900
So apparently it heals them while it does that.

329
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,600
All right.

330
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,500
So this gives him a heal, basically.

331
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:48,840
Are launched back and a bled Okay, so it boosts healing for allies while damaging Oh, and it boosts healing too And applies vulnerability Oh my god, wait, it applies vulnerability That's crazy So it makes them easier to kill So this boosts healing and also And also like Heals and then damage the other person Knocks them back and boosts vulnerability Alright,

332
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,560
okay, we got to see the widow Widow shit All right.

333
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,280
Gains her.

334
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,380
Explose on her Phoenix rounds and heal allies in the blast radius.

335
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,080
Explose on impact.

336
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,820
Explose on impact.

337
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,740
What the heck?

338
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,120
Oh, there we go.

339
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,160
Yeah, stop letting them die.

341
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,280
Okay.

342
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,340
What's the cooldown though for this?

343
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,140
I need a note.

344
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh my god, I'm a healer.

345
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,540
I don't think I don't think I'll know any healer that's gonna do this.

346
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,760
Wait, is there a cooldown?

347
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,080
There's no cooldown?

348
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,480
Wait!

349
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,800
Oh, but it does less damage.

350
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,400
Wait, she is triple!

351
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,880
Oh my god, wait, she could...

352
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,560
Okay, there's...

353
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay, you cannot play her as like triple support.

354
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,680
You cannot play her as a secondary support.

355
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,400
But like, there's no cooldown.

356
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,320
But the only issue is that it's less damage.

357
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:50,900
Actual...

358
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,400
Headshots don't do more damage.

359
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,820
I don't think so.

360
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,560
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

361
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:55,900
See?

362
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,640
It doesn't even do more healing.

363
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,640
Yeah, it doesn't do more healing.

364
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,700
It doesn't matter.

365
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,560
Yeah, does that have AoE?

366
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,280
Wait a minute!

367
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,020
Oh, it does less healing, though.

368
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,700
But I can technically miss.

369
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,820
Game is game.

370
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,440
Yeah, yeah, I can technically miss and heal, but it does do less healing.

371
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,660
That's the thing.

372
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,240
You don't have to headshot, too.

373
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:53,260
I thought I thought there'd be a cooldown but there's no cooldown that's crazy that's actually crazy bro why play ultran yeah why play ultran the only issue is that it does do less damage but bro I could snipe play bro like but the thing is I can heal from so far away I can literally just perch up and be like a sniper healer like from here like I don't have to do anything and her pretty crazy.

374
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,840
I think her ult is like one of the strongest ults.

375
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,520
But like it's her ult is so strong when for people who know how to use it.

376
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,460
I can't heal myself.

377
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,880
Oh yeah, they did do.

378
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,140
What else did they change?

379
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,020
Yes, really?

380
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,280
What?

381
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:07,760
Okay.

382
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,500
This one's crazy though.

383
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,740
What was it?

384
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,560
Like bro, this is crazy.

385
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,880
This is insane.

386
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,420
Wait, there's no cooldown?

387
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,980
Wait a minute!

388
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,860
Oh wait, there is.

389
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,240
There is.

390
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,520
There is.

391
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,660
Okay, I was gonna be like, there's no way.

392
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,820
Okay, that is crazy.

393
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,540
That is so strong.

394
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,240
There is cooldowns.

395
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,060
Thank God for that.

396
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,760
I was gonna be like, freaky out if there's no cooldowns for that.

397
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,260
Thank God.

398
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,160
Okay, it's a 30 second cooldown.

399
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,180
That is strong.

400
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,980
That is very strong.

401
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,340
Lay's swing in a pot, dashing for it at the end, and he swooshly dashes.

402
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,280
Okay, I'll play this, and I won't understand what I'm doing.

403
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,500
I don't play play late.

404
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
How do I do this?

405
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,560
Oh my god!

406
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Wow!

407
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,900
Okay.

408
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,660
Oh, okay.

409
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,700
Oh, whoa.

410
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,800
Oh, gosh.

411
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,980
I heard that came from the zombie mode, too.

412
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,700
Yeah, that's...

413
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah.

414
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,720
That's scary.

415
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,980
Wow, okay.

416
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,120
That's a lot of damage.

417
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,320
Yeah, that's a lot.

418
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,660
That's a lot of that.

419
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,280
So those are all the new team up.

420
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:29,840
did hear, I did hear that they did make a couple, they buffed a lot, they buffed everything and nerfed nothing.

421
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:36,740
So, this one thing that I really liked is that you can finally put a shield in front of you.

422
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,700
Like, you don't have to be like, please, team, team, team, get over, team, team, get over here.

423
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm getting so bad.

424
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:44,920
Team.

425
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,700
Also, it's a lot bigger now.

426
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,120
I don't know if you noticed this, But the shield grew twice as the size.

427
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,060
It is a lot bigger.

428
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,460
Oh, yeah.

429
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,580
Yeah, that is huge.

430
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,420
It's actually so freaking big.

431
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,320
Yeah.

432
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,700
Yeah, so they did that.

433
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,560
So you don't have to, you know.

434
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,280
Also, the push range is bigger now.

435
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,080
It is bigger.

436
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,660
Oh, it's just for yourself.

437
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,440
Oh, my God.

438
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,860
It's just for myself, too.

439
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,080
Wait, my shield is so much bigger than your shield.

440
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,100
That's right.

441
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,580
It's bigger.

442
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,560
The shield is bigger than it looks in the mirror.

443
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,640
It's right.

444
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,760
My shield is bigger than your shield.

445
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:28,960
Yeah, why?

446
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,700
I can just use myself shield.

447
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,220
Oh, my God.

448
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,160
Is it cold outside for you?

449
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,960
So this is the one thing I kept track of.

450
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,160
Because I was like, I can give myself a shield.

451
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,020
All right, whatever stuff did they change that you guys want to check out?

452
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,220

00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,020
That?

472
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,580
No, that's not it.

473
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,800
That can't be it.

474
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,280
It's just one.

475
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,240

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,360
It's a vulnerability.

489
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,580
So when I do the F, F key, he has like bigger vulnerability.

490
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,860
All right, what does Penny do?

491
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,300
Apparently Penny heals now.

492
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,040
How does she heal?

493
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,500
The concealed cyber...

494
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:45,860
Oh!

495
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,680
Immobilized Penny and allied skin and...

496
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,400
movement while in the... Oh, wait, what?

497
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,580
The web of life and destiny is fragile.

498
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,120
Someone has to protect it.

499
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,060
Are you getting healed?

500
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,960
Are you getting healed, ma'am?

501
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,340
I think he is.

502
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,940
I can't see... Oh, wait.

503
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,680
Let me...

504
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,120
I realize I don't have the heal thing on.

505
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,440
Where was that?

506
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,660
It was on...

507
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,540
It was on...

508
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,120
Controller.

509
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,280
Okay, let's see.

510
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Ally health bars.

511
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,680
Alright, there you go.

512
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,940
Oh yeah!

513
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,660
Wait, he's getting healed!

514
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,380
How many can I have up there?

515
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,260
Wait, does this stack?

516
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,260
Oh my god, it heals!

517
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,260
Oh, well, he can't outlive that, but oh my god, it's healing!

518
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,480
Like very slowly, very, very slowly.

519
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,220
It's not a lot, but it's getting there.

520
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,080
Uh, like, thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you, thank you.

521
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,240
Like, you know, he's getting there.

522
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,380
It's something, you know?

523
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,060
And that's movement buff, too, you know?

524
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,320
Like, it's something.

525
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,100
Look at that.

526
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,200
Look at he dies.

527
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,480
It takes him a longer time to die.

528
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,660
That's all that matters.

529
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,240
Is it her web?

530
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,500
I think it's just her web.

531
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,220
Yeah, oh, wait, no.

532
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,260
Oh, it's a spider next to us, too.

533
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,880
You're up, little one.

534
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,100
Alright.

535
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:11,980
Don't worry.

536
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,240
Oh.

537
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,860
Oh, I got you.

538
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,760
I mean, that's...

539
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,680
That's...

540
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh, he's dead.

541
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:19,680
Oh.

542
00:37:19,700 --> 00:38:09,220
okay he's dead but you know that's just something he's he died he died but you know it it let him live for five seconds it's like a band-aid yeah i mean it's like a little band-aid but you know i stopped the blood for a little you know he might have died from blood loss but i stopped it a little bit I yeah it gave over yeah yeah yeah you know it might blend through the band-aid but you know it's the thought that counts yeah band-aid made of webs it's the thought that counts guys it really is all right all right what else what else that yeah that five seconds yeah I gave a band-aid until that healer came over,

543
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,520
okay?

544
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,640
I was like, here's a band-aid for your boo-boo.

545
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm gonna take you to the hospital now.

546
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
All right, what does Mr. Fantastic do?

547
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,320
What is this new change?

548
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,020
Um, like I said, they buffed everything and I couldn't keep track.

549
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,900
I couldn't keep track.

550
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,160
I don't play Mr. Fantastic, so I don't know exactly.

551
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:52,240
All right, do you guys notice anything different i don't he can shield while inflated now they buff more yeah you can use rectangle while in inflated mode what the heck does rectangle mean it's in his oh it's in his macho state okay

552
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:33,840
oh nothing happened oh go to a hundred all right how do i all right don't i got this all right don't worry i'm always at 100 all right oh no i need more come on all right oh i could do that while in macho okay i get it i get it now so i can go like big mode i can go big mode while like uh to reflect while no i just did reflect that's fly.

553
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,460
All right, there you go.

554
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,280
Don't worry, I'm almost there.

555
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:37,760
There you go.

556
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,640
That's right.

557
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,100
I'm big boy now.

558
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,420
What you gotta do about that?

559
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:45,980
Okay.

560
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,780
No, it didn't end early.

561
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,740
It's just because, like, I went into reflection.

562
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,720
I'll reflect.

563
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,520
Yeah, I went to reflect mode.

564
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,220
So when you go reflect mode, it ends in the big mode early.

565
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:04,920
Yeah.

566
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
Let me see.

567
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,200
So, let's see.

568
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm big bow now, like that, and I can end it here.

569
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,940
And just do, like, the reflect.

570
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,080
Reflect time.

571
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,080
Alright.

572
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,160
Is there anything else?

573
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,660
Anything else that's new?

574
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,020
You guys want to check out?

575
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,300
We have five more minutes before we go to Time Square.

576
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,240
Rocky Raccoon?

577
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,560
Yeah, but we don't care about that.

578
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,660
Like, who shoots this gun at Rocket?

579
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,720
Like, Like, who shoots this gun as rocket?

580
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,040
I still...

581
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,860
Oh, the Magneto Bupkod.

582
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,440
Magneto gets everything.

583
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,340
What?

584
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,100
It's not fair.

585
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,800
He gets everything.

586
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,980
It's crazy.

587
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,920
Look, I can shield myself.

588
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,840
And I can shield the other person.

589
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,160
Oh, wait.

590
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,260
I got two bubbles now.

591
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,000
Let's go.

592
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,960
Oh, they separated the bubbles now.

593
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,620
Oh, I just noticed that.

594
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,980
Wait, oh, wait.

595
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,520
They separated the bubbles.

596
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,100
Yeah, I get my own shield.

597
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,920
I get my own shield.

598
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,720
And then I can also shield him.

599
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,520
Oh, my God.

600
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,500
Wait, that's actually great.

601
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,220
I love that.

602
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,700
Because then you feel like Magnum feels sorry.

603
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,460
I shielded myself.

604
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,040
I was like, that's a lie.

605
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,360
I was like, they changed that to season five.

606
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,240
You can't use that excuse anymore.

607
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,480
I know you have a shield.

608
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,500
You can't say you shielded yourself.

609
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,360
You can't say that no more.

610
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,960
Yeah, now you have...

611
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,600
You can't say sorry I wasted a bubble on myself Because you have one bubble just for other

612
00:41:48,280 --> 00:42:01,340
Now you have to help me Alright Sorry I bubbled this way Yes, I bubbled the wrong person Now he just has to bubble the wrong person What's the team up like?

613
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh, I showed team up but it's crazy um can we see how fast dead adam is now oh yeah you want to see how fast adam is all right but i'll show the team up again team up is strong as hell look like this is this is scary this is this is unneeded

614
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:36,340
that is so unneeded yeah that doesn't believe It is very much Unneeded for him.

615
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,660
He already has everything.

616
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,900
Most likely I won't be playing Gambit first.

617
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:41,720
I think Ninja... Oh yeah.

618
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,180
I'll be on a team with Ninja, Tim, Las, Craigie, and J3.

619
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,460
Most likely I think Ninja will be playing Gambit first.

620
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,900
Everything.

621
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,600
Most likely.

622
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,180
But I'll play Gambit second.

623
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,740
But even then he's... I don't know.

624
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,820
Gambit is so scary.

625
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,100
Gambit...

626
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:52,820
is a lot he really is he's a lot of information yeah cuz I mean I usually let them play it first because you know I can I like you know I'm not in a rush to I'm not like I'm not in a rush to play gambit you know but like I I don't really care uh oh you don't have the recolor but I have this one i like the default more but i think it's just preference because i love the default design of gambit also i think we're supposed to are you supposed to go to town time square now okay no uh all right uh no not yet okay i just want to be sure we're not if we're supposed to go to time square uh what else oh yeah someone wants to check out the hulk bus what did they do for

627
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,440
The cleanse is crazy.

628
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,800
Cleanse is always crazy.

629
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,560
We didn't show the valve pass already, but I can look at it after Times Square.

630
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,340
What did they do to Hulk?

631
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,400
His clap reduces his shield?

632
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,080
That.

633
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
What the fuck is...

634
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,180
Don't think they didn't make him blue.

635
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,380
What does it do?

636
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,480
That.

637
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,360
By the way, you can't clap three times.

638
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,260
I just took the cooldown off.

639
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,380
All right.

640
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,040
There we go.

641
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,600
Is that?

642
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,820
Like I said, I don't know.

643
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,280
I don't play Hulk, so I don't know what they do differently.

644
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:42,860
I don't know.

645
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,020
Is he blue, though?

646
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,720
Unfortunately, he is not blue, guys.

647
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,320
I'm sorry.

648
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,580
I'm sorry.

649
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,240
I know you would love if he was blue, but unfortunately, he is not blue.

650
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,400
clap.

651
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,600
Oh, they lower the cooldown?

652
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,220
Okay.

653
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,500
Bumpa and then bubble.

654
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,220
Clap!

655
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,920
There we go.

656
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,100
I did it.

657
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,980
That's all you get on hug.

658
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,660
That's it.

659
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,560
That's all you get.

660
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,860
Oh, okay, alright.

661
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,640
It's time for time square, I believe.

662
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,400
I believe it's time square time.

663
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,240
Alright.

664
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,660
I just go in.

665
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,890
Should everybody else be here now?

666
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,080
Oh, hey, Super is here.

667
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Alright.

668
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,340
See, we all follow the...

669
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,800
We all follow the briefing.

670
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,040
There's time here.

671
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,900
This is what I was saying!

672
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,720
It actually has Disney Plus ads.

673
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,440
Like...

674
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,940
That's what I'm saying.

675
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,840
It's Disney Plus ads right here.

676
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,180
Hi, neighbor.

677
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,840
Well, hello there.

678
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,280
This is where you get role-playing now.

679
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,040
Real-time squaring.

680
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,480
All right.

681
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,460
Yeah, so there's like a bunch of ads.

682
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,140
Look, oh my god.

683
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,140
See, he's a menace.

684
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,180
I told you.

685
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,640
He's a goddamn menace.

686
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,420
And then there he is over here.

687
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,440
And then there's like, there's a bunch of ads.

688
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,040
It's just ads.

689
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,120
It's just, it's Kingpin.

690
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,700
There's the test kitchen.

691
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,400
There's like, oh look, there's, there's like, you can eat what your favorite, oh my god, it's like those people were really lonely and they eat what was plushy.

692
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,640
That's, that's us.

693
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,140
There's Van Dunes, Coffee Bean, the tomb of Dracula.

694
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,020
There's ice cream, guys.

695
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,520
Wait, how far can I go?

696
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,540
Wait, there's so much.

697
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,400
There's Wakanda.

698
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,240
There's Marvel Unlimited.

699
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,240
Hello, sir.

700
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,220
Oh, my God.

701
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,960
Marvel .com Unlimited.

702
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,580
Oh, my God.

703
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,420
It's an ad within an ad.

704
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,020
Some healing would be nice.

705
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,940
Yeah, so they have it this way.

706
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,820
Hub menu.

707
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,960
Oh, there's everybody else.

708
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,920
How do I...

709
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,320
Is there no voice chat?

710
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,480
Am I even in the voice chat?

711
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:58,560
lobby audio push to talk okay uh what is my push to oh no voice changer it is okay i don't know if there is i don't think you can it's just our normal rp it's like slash rp yeah i think 100 person voice chat would be a bit too much yeah so there's there's wilson there's more kingpin right there universal ninja store why does ninja get his own store

712
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,240
It's not big!

713
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,180
He gets his own store, too?

714
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,840
Like...

715
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,760
He gets early access and his own store?

716
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,220
That's not big.

717
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,260
I think it's not Ninja Ninja.

718
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,020
I think this is so funny.

719
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,320
That it gives me Disney Plus ads.

720
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,620
I guess.

721
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,880
Have you guys subscribed to Disney Plus yet?

722
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,480
Chat?

723
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,980
It actually is like New York City, though.

724
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,380
It feels like New York City.

725
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,600
But it's trying to get us out of Doom Q.

726
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,900
Like, they're like, get out of Doom Q.

727
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,360
When people role play here.

728
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,920
They're making us role play here now.

729
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,020
I like how there's like, there's like little crossing thing.

730
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,760
Yeah, it's a product placement.

731
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,880
Just like the real...

732
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,400
Wait, there's subway.

733
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,980
Oh, wait, no, never mind.

734
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:02,880
I was going to...

735
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,080
What?

736
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,440
There's a hot topic.

737
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,460
You get it.

738
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,020
Oh, my God.

739
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:11,460
Wait.

740
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,560
No way.

741
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,840
No way.

742
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,840
Why is hot topic a bar?

743
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,560
That's just hot topic.

744
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,800
Hey.

745
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,380
Oh, my God.

746
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,220
It's a fancy as hot topic, guys.

747
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,420
So aren't you hot?

748
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,300
Topic.

749
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:31,620
What is he doing?

750
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,120
He crushed the vampire.

751
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,240
Now he's New York towards a brighter.

752
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,980
But, no, no, no.

753
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,200
Oh my god, he wants.

754
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,660
No, he can't win.

755
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,940
Dad wants to go to Hot Topic.

756
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,720
He really does.

757
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,040
That's crazy.

758
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,460
I didn't realize it would be Hot Topic here.

759
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,300
There's no bookstore.

760
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:53,880
Alright, come on.

761
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,980
No, no.

762
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:55,680
Come on.

763
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:55,820
Come on.

764
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,060
Come on.

765
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:56,360
Come on.

766
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:56,940
Come on.

767
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,040
Come on.

768
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,260
No.

769
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,160
No.

770
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:58,500
No.

771
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,480
Alright, he wins.

772
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,120
Give me a sec.

773
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,000
I gotta give him food.

774
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:01,600
He wins.

775
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,480
I'll look at the hot topic.

776
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,720
I gave him a little treat.

777
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,060
I want to enjoy hot topic.

778
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,960
It works every time.

779
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,020
It's because I'm sponsored, okay?

780
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,520
I need him to be because I'm trying to look through the things.

781
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,300
Pim Test Kitchen.

782
00:50:51,820 --> 00:51:24,220
I think it's funny that oh accidentally added him bonjour bonjour mon ami that's crazy i like how everything is like you know like um oh my god there's the avengers gift store like just tony stark doesn't need more money he technically he doesn't need more oh my god there's pure capitalism he of course he's merchandising the avengers like He made,

783
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,440
he's merchandising the adventures.

784
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,180
Yes, he does.

785
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,020
He wants a little bit more money for Tony Stark.

786
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,460
You think Stark now or come?

787
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,120
Yeah, he sold out, bro.

788
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,080
He's sold.

789
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,280
I still can't believe there's Hot Topic.

790
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,640
Bro, like, everything else is a parody.

791
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,560
And then there's goddamn Hot Topic.

792
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,780
Like, where did that go from?

793
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,200
It's just literally on topic.

794
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,180
I mean, it is time square.

795
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,940
I do admit, it is time square.

796
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,680
You're like, Emma took everything from the divorce.

797
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,720
She sure did.

798
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,300
That's crazy.

799
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,720
That's actually hilarious.

800
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,400
I was not expecting.

801
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,500
I was not expecting it.

802
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,200
But yes, there's going to be a lot of RP here.

803
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,460

00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:37,630
Are this Agatha?

827
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,250
Wait, would I get DMCA's?

828
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,730
Oh, werewolf fight.

829
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:45,770
Oh, no, we saw this.

830
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,590
Okay, yeah, yeah.

831
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:54,010
I'm thinking like, if I, if I am in time square, YouTube with, like, the audio clips of this?

832
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,390
With the audio clips of this?

833
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:02,370
Give me, like, uh, Disney shall take your monetization.

834
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:04,970
That'd be pretty funny.

835
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:06,030
I want to test that out.

836
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,150
I'm going to test that out in season 5.

837
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:12,590
I'll go to Times Square and I start just watching the screen and see if it hits me.

838
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,450
I'll do that on YouTube.

839
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,870
I think it'd be pretty funny.

840
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,470
Yeah.

841
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:23,110
You want my Bad revenue, mouse.

842
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,090
Taking one for the team exactly.

843
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:26,450
Oh, wait.

844
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:27,730
Are we supposed to?

845
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,130
How did...

846
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,170
Wait, how did Jimbo Limbo get here?

847
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,030
Wait.

848
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,650
Wait, you're not part of the early access.

849
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,270
How did you get in?

850
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:40,870
How did...

851
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,990
Wait a minute, Jimbo Limbo?

852
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,270
You're not on the list.

853
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,610
Who's Jimbo?

854
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,630
How did he get in here?

855
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,670
I know Jimbo, he's like from EU.

856
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:57,830
He's an EU player.

857
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,330
But he's not on the list, though.

858
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,890
I thought this was...

859
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,550
No, it's not a dev.

860
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,250
It's just a regular guy.

861
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,790
No, he's not a dev.

862
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:09,350
He's like...

863
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:11,370
He's a regular guy from EU.

864
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,450
How did you get in here?

865
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,510
He's Jimbo.

866
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,650
He's just...

867
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,670
He came in through the back door.

868
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,470
One of these is not like the other.

869
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,010
Truly isn't.

870
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,250
He's like, I know, don't keep it.

871
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:37,930
Don't worry.

872
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,310
Like, she's waiting for me inside the club.

873
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,250
Yeah, he has a plus one to the wedding.

874
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:46,110
You're right.

875
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:46,690
You're right.

876
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:51,310
I mean, look up what we have to do here.

877
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:53,730
Uh...

878
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,850
I'll make sure.

879
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:56,270
Alright.

880
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,610
That's really it.

881
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,070
There's more Easter eggs?

882
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,750
They were like, look at the Easter eggs.

883
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,430
I think I found all the Easter eggs.

884
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,070
Like, Hot Topic.

885
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,370
I think that's all.

886
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,730
Hot Topic was the Easter egg.

887
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:14,870
I mean, there's stuff here.

888
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,110
Energy fair today.

889
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:18,410
There's, like, stuff outside the border, too.

890
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,130
Which I noticed.

891
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:24,350
No, you can't go into any of the buildings, unfortunately.

892
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,790
I think that would break the game if you do.

893
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:32,970
This is a...

894
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:35,190
What if Hot Topping was a bar?

895
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,070
What if Hot Topping was a bar?

896
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,330
That's good.

897
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,270
Wait, there's Box Lunch, too.

898
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,350
Isn't that, like, a bag brand?

899
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:47,510
Or is that Lunch Box?

900
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:48,130
I don't remember.

901
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,230
No, that's something else.

902
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:52,410
I was thinking about something else.

903
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,950
Queen in Black Cube Rule Ring.

904
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:58,510
What if Hot Topic was blue, guys?

905
01:00:58,790 --> 01:00:59,310
Just...

906
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,370
Yeah, oh yeah.

907
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:03,410
I was thinking about...

908
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,230
I was thinking about...

909
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,590
Yeah, I was thinking about different red.

910
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,250
Guys, what if Hot Topic was blue?

911
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,350
That would be wild.

912
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:11,830
Imagine...

913
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:16,960
I would...

914
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,700
I hope in April 4th, they just turned all the characters blue.

915
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:24,240
Today's special Anna's pork pie.

916
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,860
Ooh, that looks good.

917
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,080
Pizza hot and tasty.

918
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,520
Tastes like chrome.

919
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,300
Ooh, nice.

920
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,580
NYTTD, major crime unit.

921
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,820
I trust the kingpin.

922
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:39,680
Look at him.

923
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,300
Oh, wait.

924
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,920
You can fly all the way there?

925
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,180
What?

926
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,620
Oh, that's cool.

927
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,780
Wait, you can play B-Ball.

928
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,540
Oh, my God.

929
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,420
Wait, what's this?

930
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,360
Oh, it's just a Kong shoe.

931
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:58,920
Okay, someone.

932
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,100
Wait, I can play...

933
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,720
The baller is back, guys.

934
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,640
I can play B-ball.

935
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,180
That's cool.

936
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,040
I didn't realize there was a basketball court.

937
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,420
We're balling now.

938
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:12,940
That's cool.

939
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,620
I like that.

940
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,980
I like that you can play B- You can just go and play B-ball.

941
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,580
I think we have, like, our beachy modes, too.

942
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,860
We're the ball.

943
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:22,920
You gotta make your ball.

944
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,800
It's Mag vs.

945
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,520
Mag D-Baltap.

946
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,980
Port of the basket.

947
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,700
Oh, there's like plushies here, too.

948
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,000
Wait, I noticed that.

949
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,180
There's like plushies here as well.

950
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,180
I'm always nervous.

951
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,880
I'm going to be nervous for the group.

952
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,940
I'm always nervous in the big matches.

953
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,140
Because I know I, like, played with them before.

954
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,560
Like, five people.

955
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,200
Five is more than two.

956
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,320
That's a lot.

957
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,740
Rocket is the bot.

958
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,320
I'm going to be super nervous.

959
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,880
It's also, it's like, you know, Tim and Ninja.

960
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:14,780
And them, they're like, you know, they've been streaming for so long.

961
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,740
No, it's me.

962
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,080
Tim, Ninja, Laz, Craigie, and J3.

963
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,340
That's the group.

964
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,300
What the heck?

965
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Are they going to play basketball now?

966
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,100
Go play basketball.

967
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,740
Oh, they're all waiting for all charges.

968
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,420
Oh my god, wait, you're right!

969
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,540
Someone pick me up.

970
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,080
Come on, guys.

971
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,000
We gotta do a walk in the...

972
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,920
Hulk thing in the...

973
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,860
Guys, come on.

974
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:51,460
I don't want...

975
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,540
You guys can imply what I'm talking about.

976
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,040
Hold me like a basketball.

977
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,240
Come on.

978
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,760
Hold me like a basketball.

979
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,560
You know you want to.

980
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,740
Hold me like a basketball, guys.

981
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,920
Oh, my God.

982
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,780
Do I have to spell it out for all of you?

983
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,380
Slam dunk me.

984
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,440
I have to spell it out.

985
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,060
I'll have to go in.

986
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,380
Oh, my God.

987
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:19,860
Wait, wait, wait.

988
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,240
No, okay.

989
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:20,780
He got it.

990
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,460
He got it.

991
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,400
He got it.

992
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,820
Wait, how do I, how do I get in?

993
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,800
Wait, why can't I get on?

994
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,600
Why can't I get?

995
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:30,120
No!

996
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,520
Oh, wait, there we go.

997
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,200
How do I get on?

998
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,640
Why can't I get on?

999
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,800
I can't team up!

1000
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:39,380
No!

1001
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,240
What's the point?

1002
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,460
Alright, guys, I have to get into the VC real quick.

1003
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,020
What's the point?

1004
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,140
Can't even team up.

1005
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,800
I need to add my...

1006
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,420
What's the point?

1007
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,600
How do I be ball?

1008
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,240
How can I be far?

01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,730
No, you still have to hit him four times.

1044
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:24,110
It's four times with or without.

1045

He unbanned me.

1058
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,410

1059
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:08,070
Oh, email address is banned now.

1060
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:09,870
Oh, you had to get a run, man.

1061

All right.

1062
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:11,010
See you.

1063
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,730
All right, sound guy.

1064
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:12,870
I lowered Craigie.

1065
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,630
I lowered Tim.

1066
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,070
Let me know if everything's good.

1067
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:15,590
Craigie?

1068
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:17,550
I think so, bro.

1069
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:20,590
You could have a rare Tim to tap man.

1070
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:21,310
Bucky angle.

1071
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,130
Oh.

1072
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:23,350
Oh.

1073
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:24,930
Wait, we have to ban ninja now?

1074
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,170
I mean, if somebody wants to play DP, I thought you were still.

1075
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:33,310
Listen, if no one wants to play the new character, I'll try Gambit.

1076
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:34,290
Oh, yeah, brother.

1077
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,530
Doki can go Gambit.

1078
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,810
Yeah, I could do Gambit.

1079
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:42,250
And I'll start Invisible Woman.

1080
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,770
Oh, you see your giant ass shield now?

1081
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,070
Yes, she has revealed she's putting it on her.

1082
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,210
It's so good.

1083
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:49,710
I'm praying that I get ulted.

1084
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,050
I'm praying someone ulted me.

1085
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,610
Magneto.

1086
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:52,270
Come here, Mag.

1087
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,270
Wait, wait, Jay.

1088
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:58,530
Do you want to do Moon Knight Blade first or Phoenix and Widow first?

1089
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,290
Ooh, whatever you want, my friend.

1090
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:03,250
I saw the, what do you call it, the Blade.

1091
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:04,030
He looks crazy.

1092
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,230
I don't have a tank team up, right?

1093
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,130
It's unlimited range, you know that, right?

1094
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:09,690
No, it's just McNeil that has it.

1095
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:10,370
Yeah, Magnus.

1096
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:11,250
Gambit.

1097
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:12,830
All right, last you go Magnus, obviously.

1098
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,330
Are you sure you didn't want to go Magnus first?

1099
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:15,350
No, you can.

1100
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,010
Make way for the King of Tees.

1101
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,510
What would you like to play, sir?

1102
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:19,090
You want to do it?

1103
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,010
Let's get it.

1104
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,130
Hulk smash!

1105
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,750
You're paid later, Moon Knight.

1106
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:23,990
Was that the real Hulk?

1107
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,250
Oh, it's up to you.

1108
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:27,750
Is that the Hulk in our team right now?

1109
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:28,890
Oh, my God.

1110
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:30,890
Yeah, you're too nice, bro.

1111
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:31,870
You pop off on Blade.

1112
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,790
Craig, did you actually play Blade?

1113
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:36,030
No.

1114
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:38,530
Oh, he'll be good.

1115
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:39,270
We're learning.

1116
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:39,630
It's okay.

1117
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,450
We're learning today.

1118
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,290
We're learning today.

1119
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,770
If Necros is on Spider-Man, I am leaving the ad.

1120
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,510
There's no way.

1121
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,530
Look at her come.

1122
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,010

1123
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:48,890
Me!

1124
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,370
I will.

1125
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:49,850
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:50,250
Sorry.

1127
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,350

All right, guys.

1130
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:25,630
All right, it's okay.

1131
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:26,130
It's okay.

1132
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,490
I'll cleanse you.

1133
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:28,790

Nah, you got this.

1135
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:32,390
You got this.

1136
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,130
You're so healthy.

1137
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:34,090
Oh, it's great.

1138
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:40,510
Oh, my God.

1139
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,190
You guys are already making so much damage.

1140
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:43,830
I'm a draggy.

1141
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:44,650
You went so deep, bro.

1142
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:45,650
Phoenix One is on top.

1143
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:47,590
I'm dead.

1144
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:48,670
Oh, we're dead.

1145
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:49,950
I'm dead.

1146
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:51,250
I'm dead.

1147
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,130
Phoenix up top, by the way.

1148
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,030
Shooting for free.

1149
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:55,530
Yeah, he's just having high ground for free.

1150
01:14:58,350 --> 01:14:59,430
This isn't good.

1151
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,090
We're sweating.

1152
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:00,690
They're trying to guard.

1153
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:00,850
Don't worry.

1154
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:01,470
I got you.

1155
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:01,870
I got you.

1156
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,310
I got you.

1157
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:03,130
I have cards.

1158
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,710
I'll go widow.

1159
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,630
They run a trip now.

1160
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,350
They are solo tank, though.

1161
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,250
With the widow, it's kind of a great idea.

1162
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,590
Yeah, I think they have a lot of subpoenas.

1163
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:12,770
We need that triple sub.

1164
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:14,490
I could go.

1165
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:16,910
I can swap.

1166
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:18,810
I will swap.

1167
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:20,430
Yeah.

1168
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,550
I can go high ground real quick.

1169
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:24,910
Is there a character I should go?

1170
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:25,550
Maybe Cloak?

1171
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:26,150
I don't even know.

1172
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:29,150
Got you.

1173
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:29,650
I got you.

1174
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:31,190
Oh, God.

1175
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,070
I think this is good for now.

1176
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:35,850
This is rough.

1177
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:36,790
I'm trying to heal you.

1178
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:37,630
No, one shot comes.

1179
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:37,950
She's one.

1180
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:38,990
She's one.

1181
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:40,210
She's actually nice.

1182
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,530
I have no more cards right now.

1183
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,110
No, bro.

1184
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:45,270
We gotta get this Phoenix, bro.

1185
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:45,890
Someone's got it.

1186
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:46,150
She's out.

1187
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:46,450
She's out.

1188
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:46,850
She's out.

1189
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,070
She's going to get healed again.

1190
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,310
Can't really use my cards for your offense.

1191
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,370
If you...

1192
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:56,630
Oh, bye.

1193
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:57,890
Watch out!

1194
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:59,410
I couldn't heal you.

1195
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:00,430
He didn't get me.

1196
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:01,450
Wait, they could die here.

1197
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:01,950
They could die here!

1198
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,770
That is nice!

1199
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:04,710

1200
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:06,490

01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:10,070
That was awesome.

1204
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,250
All I had to do was put my shield up.

1205
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:12,610
I didn't.

1206
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:12,990
Why?

1207
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,710

01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:23,350

They're not making portal.

1240
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:18,450

01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:35,930
Spider-Man behind me.

1248
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:37,310
Tucker's out.

1250
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:38,570

01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:41,410
I'm gonna ult him here, bro.

1252
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,370
I'm literally just getting some space a little.

1253
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:44,470
I'm trying to...

1254
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:45,910
Look at him back here.

1255
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,090
All right, I got your heels.

1256
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,270
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1257
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:51,650

01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:52,430
Nice block.

1259
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:53,150

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1261
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:59,010
The perfect Spider-Man ult right here.

1262
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:01,750
Okay, I can't cleanse it.

1263
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:02,650
I don't have the cards.

1264
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,290
That's fine.

1265
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:04,210
If we don't die, really.

1266
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:04,790
He has it.

1267
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:06,490
I got older.

1268
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,770
Well, that needs to die.

1269
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:10,050
I don't have the cards.

1270
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:10,830
Take care.

1271
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,250
Oh, poof.

1272
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,470
Ooh, still got an edge.

1273
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:14,410
Yes.

1274
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:16,930
Oh.

1275
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:18,370
There you go.

1276
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:19,970
How long?

1277
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,470
We have like so many people on us back here.

1278
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,610
I'm on my way back.

1279
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:25,090
Everyone died.

1280
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:25,750
Everyone died this way.

1281
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,110
I am close to up.

1282
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,230
You mess with the amazing Spider-Man!

1283
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:31,510
I'm dead bro, that's all I know.

1284
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,830
You're so healthy!

1285
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:34,550
I'm so, I've never been healthier.

1286
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,370
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

1287
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:36,450
I saved the other support.

1288
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:40,070
I don't know about you though.

1289
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:40,710
Holy moly.

1290
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,330
Oh my god, you have one HP.

1291
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,750
I'm opening up this pit, bro.

1292

We're still in the woods.

1295

He's only my left.

1296
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:05,670
We're still in the middle.

1297
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:08,570
Oh, oh I'll use my ult too

1298
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:12,590

01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:57,350
We're here.

1515
01:28:57,610 --> 01:28:58,090
I stalled.

1516
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:59,350
I stalled.

1517
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,530
I'm touching.

1518
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:01,510
I'm touching.

1519
01:29:02,450 --> 01:29:02,470
I'm on.

1520
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:02,710
I'm here.

1521
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:03,850
Nice, nice, nice.

1522
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:04,650
Hey, your healer's here.

1523
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:05,590
You guys are good.

1524
01:29:06,830 --> 01:29:07,450
Oh, that's a good old.

1525
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:08,610
Oh, that's a really good old.

1526
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:09,030
Oh, no.

1527
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:09,730
Never mind.

1528
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:10,750
I guess not.

1529
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:13,910
Oh, damn.

1530
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:14,970
I'm healing.

1531
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:15,270
I'm healing.

1532
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:15,630
Stay right there.

1533
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,950
Stay right there.

1534
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:16,110
Shit.

1535
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,890
Oh, my God.

1536
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:18,130
Help.

1537
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:19,510
I got you.

1538
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:22,670
Oh, my God.

1539
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:23,450
Crazy.

1540
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:25,210
That was wild.

1541
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:26,670
That was it.

1542
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:28,090
Fucking crazy fight.

1543
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,650
Ty, you want to stay on Rocket still?

1544
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,370
Ah, no, no, no, no.

1545
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:33,810
It's fine, it's fine.

1546
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:34,330
You want to swap?

1547
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:35,010
I'll do Luna.

1548
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:35,410
I'll do Luna.

1549
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:37,770
Yeah, he's off a spot, or you're safe now.

1550
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:38,610
I'm safe.

1551
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:38,970
I'm okay.

1552
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:41,230
He can't hurt you no more.

1553
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:41,930
I'm okay.

1554
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:46,370

01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:52,510
Venom?

Be aggressive.

01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:02,150
Yeah, go.

1569
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,810
Push in.

Yeah, we have so many heals.

1571
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:05,030
We could go up.

1572
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,870
Coming over?

1573
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:09,990
Knocker the one left side.

1574
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:14,810
Better on us again.

1575
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:15,450
Better on your healers.

1576
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,570
Oh, I'm backing up.

1577
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:17,090

There's three people back live.

1580

We got way too aggro, boys.

1581
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:24,690
We got way too aggro.

1582
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:26,250

We got blood.

1610
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:40,750

1612
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:44,150
I think she went out last.

1613
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:45,790
I lost her.

1614
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:49,470

1615
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:49,650

01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:50,550

I do have rest for next fight.

1629
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:33,110

01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:44,270
Your ult can actually make or break kind of thing here.

1635
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:46,510
And they'll never expect it.

1636
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,250
Mags left alone.

1637
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:55,990
They have Adam now, by the way.

1638
01:32:56,590 --> 01:32:57,290
Oh, they got me.

1639
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:57,690
That was good.

1640
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:59,810
I don't got you anymore.

1641
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:00,510
I'm dead, bro.

1642
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:01,690
I'm literally just dead.

1643
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:04,390
We got to push up, though, seriously.

1644
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,010
I can't really get out.

1645
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:06,430
Yeah, yeah, we got to push up.

1646
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:09,230
I'm on point, though.

1647
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:10,750
Yeah, I'm down.

1648
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,190
I'm still on point.

1649
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:13,170
I can start for a little bit.

1650
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,070
Got Gambit?

1651
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:18,090
Smile's going to be sick, but...

1652
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:18,330
Oh!

01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:21,550
Adam, we're like a...

1654
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,790
How do you do this?

1655
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:24,050
That's good.

1656
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:25,290
We wanted to make it long, you know?

1657
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:26,450
We want to showcase everything.

1658
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:27,790
True.

1659
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:56,810

I mean.

1661
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:00,090
I have no healing.

1662
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,010
Tim, one more thing.

1663
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:01,990
I got to pick it up.

1664
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,270
Up to you, Jay.

1665
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:03,710
What do you want to do?

1666
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:05,010
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1667
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,370
Um, well, those got changed.

1668
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:12,810
Uh, only other one is Hawkeye, but they changed his dagger.

1669
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:13,890
Mr. Fantastic.

1670
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:15,650
Mr. Fantastic got buffed.

1671
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:16,810
Oh yeah, that's true.

1672
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,470
I'll do the Hawkeye then.

1673
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,730
Ooh, I don't, I don't play that guy.

1674
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:22,090
No, no, no.

1675
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:24,630
I played like a couple of minutes off him.

1676
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:25,930
Uh, he's got Hawkeye in there.

1677
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:26,530
Who's the Hawkeye?

1678
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,770
Who is he teamed up with?

1679
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:29,570
I mean, this guy got changed.

1680
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,150
Uh, the Hawkeye team up?

1681
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,590
Oh yeah, it's with Cleo, right?

1682
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:34,290
He got changed?

1683
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:43,270
He lost his, uh, team up, so they gave him 300 health, two extra pellets, and a shotgun, and he has, uh, more damage from range.

1684
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,170
They just fall off.

1685
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:44,610
More HP.

1686
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:45,930
That's good.

1687
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:50,970
I don't think they gave, they gave, like, a lot of support, more HP, too.

1688
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:53,810
They're like, less squishy now.

1689
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,590
Makes it boys great again.

1690
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:01,050
Oh, they're doing it now.

1691
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,090
They have Captain America.

1692
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:06,310
Oh, no.

1693
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:08,850
Captain America didn't even get buffed.

1694
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,410
Oh, they got fake.

1695
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:12,230

We should go.

1707
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:22,850
We should go.

1708
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:23,910

1719
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:53,070
That's true.

1720
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,650
Bro, I was just doing the angle on the way out here.

Yeah, it does so much healing, Chad.

1723
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,110
It's actually crazy.

1724
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:32,550
The fact that I got 40k healing already.

1725
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:33,990
I just, I don't know if you're not, I'm just curious.

1726
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:36,190
The storm gives more damage.

1727
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:42,430
And, like, I haven't, I haven't done, like, any, I haven't used my, I should use my damage and deep buff more.

1728
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:45,630
But, like, we take so much damage, yeah.

1729
01:36:45,790 --> 01:36:47,050
And Wolverine got buffed.

1730
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:50,290
We take so much damage that I don't have a chance to do.

1731
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,650
You guys want me to set up on point, by the way, I'm assuming.

1732
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:55,110
I don't have a chance to do, like, um, we don't even want him to get close.

1733
01:36:56,050 --> 01:37:26,470

Let's go, bro.

1735
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:32,170
Yeah, if we lose, we'd be like, um, J3 was on Mr. Fantastic.

1736
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:33,410
Like we weren't trying.

1737
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,190
Oh, a thing won.

1738
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:40,330
Are you okay?

1739
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:44,830
I already somehow killed my thing.

1740
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:49,680
I'm at 41%.

1741
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,280
I'm not close to all.

1742
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,420
Someone's liking Captain America.

1743
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:52,280
It's one.

1744
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:52,700
Captain one.

1745
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:53,100
Captain one.

1746
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:53,500
Captain one.

1747
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:57,180
Oh, no.

1748
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,100
I don't got myself, though.

1749
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,340
And Craigie's back.

1750
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:00,780
I'll TP.

1751
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:01,280
I'll TP.

1752
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,020
No, okay.

1753
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:02,960
Jay, I got you, Jay.

1754
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,500
I got you big heals.

1755
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,500
Yeah, we still have TP.

1756
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,320
I got a TP coming in, boys.

1757
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:07,940
Get up, get up, point, get up, point.

1758
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,140
I'm going to die.

1759
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,760
I'm going to die.

1760
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:11,540
I'm dead.

1761
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,720
We have TP coming.

1762
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:13,060
We have TP coming.

1763
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:13,440
We have TP coming.

1764
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,320
We have TP coming.

1765
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:17,860
You're an ult.

01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,220
Swap it up thing.

1769
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:23,380
Uh-oh.

1770
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:24,100
Oh, no.

1771
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,100
I'm getting on my phone.

1772
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:29,660
Don't keep talking go crazier.

1773
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,300
It's five.

1774
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:31,840
I'm almost done.

1775
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,520
I'm almost done.

1776
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:33,120
I'm almost

1777
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:37,750

1778
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:37,910

1786
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:50,750
Oh, crap.

1787
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:52,110
We want a million dollars.

1788
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:54,410
We just want a million dollars.

1789
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:55,110
Good shit, guys.

1790
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:55,990
Let's go.

1791
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:59,130
We can just end stream early at this point.

1792
01:38:59,190 --> 01:38:59,810
We saw everything.

1793
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:05,410
Everyone played really well there, bro.

1794
01:39:07,370 --> 01:39:08,530
My rocket went in.

1795
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:08,950
Bro, dude.

1796
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:11,670
So, Super comes in.

1797
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:13,330
Captain America.

1798
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:17,530
I get him one shot as Captain America.

1799
01:39:17,810 --> 01:39:18,650
I get him one shot.

1800
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:21,310
He runs away, but he gets the beacon after someone gets Rez, right?

1801
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:22,610
Someone gets Rez.

1802
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:23,890
I'm pretty sure Craigie got Rez.

1803
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:25,470
I chase him down.

1804
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:26,370
I kill him.

1805
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,030
And then I'm getting pushed.

1806
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,490

How is Gambit's heals?

1816
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:11,470
Does he, like, have a lot of heals?

1817
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:12,570
Yeah, no, he does a lot.

1818
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:15,130
If you do, like, if you use E, he does so much heals.

1819
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:16,090
Oh, God.

1820
01:41:17,450 --> 01:41:19,590
And do my cards just recharge, right?

01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,490
Yeah, yeah, it's like a passive recharge.

1822
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:21,990
Oh, yeah.

1823
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:22,790

No, I got pulled.

1825
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:30,450
Don't worry.

1826
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:31,570
I have my own shield.

1827
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:33,350
Yo, I'm doing so much damage.

1828
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:34,230
I put it back.

1829
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:34,710
I put it back.

1830
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:35,290
Oh, never mind.

1831
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:35,690
It doesn't care.

1832
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:37,150
Oh, my God.

1833
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,170
Yo, crap.

01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:41,430
Trying to heal.

1836
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:42,190
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:42,830
Throw me in.

1838
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:45,790
Have a Spider-Man behind us.

1839
01:41:45,910 --> 01:41:46,630
Nice, nice, nice.

1840
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:49,510
I think we gotta push up now.

1841
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:50,810
Oh, don't keep it.

1842
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:51,910
We're so healthy.

1843
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:52,830
Kill this guy.

1844
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:55,850
Oh, they ain't moving anywhere.

01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:57,230
They ain't going nowhere.

01:41:58,630 --> 01:41:59,430
No, they're not.

1847
01:41:59,530 --> 01:41:59,930
No, they're not.

1848
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,170
Oh, they're stuck.

1849
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:01,670
They're stuck.

1850
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:03,650
Oh, they're stuck here.

1851
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:04,310
They're stuck here, guys.

1852
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:04,450
Hey!

01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:13,730
Oh, not you though.

1859
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:16,250

01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:41,800
It's about this one.

1942
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,600
We have Gambit.

1943
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,620
Oh, I got Rocket.

1944
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,080

1945
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:45,620
I got Rocket.

1946
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:49,380
I'm going for the wall.

1947
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:51,180
I'm not gonna heal.

1948
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:53,800
Bro, that is so much damage.

1949
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:54,960
Was it fat?

1950
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:55,980
Oh, it's big.

1951
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:56,840
It's most important.

1952
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,040
Oh, yeah, okay.

1953
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,460
Is it?

1954
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:00,340
Is it?

1955
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:01,900
I'm just halting.

1956
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,200
I don't know if it was a good idea.

1957
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,020
Oh, I'm losing.

1958
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,000

I got this.

1960
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:05,940
I'm blocking this.

1961
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:07,960
Oh, I've got it.

1962
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:08,380
I'm okay.

1963
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:08,740
I'm okay.

1964
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,000
I got you.

1965
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:11,900

1967
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:12,940
I'll take it.

1968
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:13,360
I got a healer.

1969
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,640

2026
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:31,100

01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:40,180
Yep, it's BP.

2035
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:41,900

01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:54,460
Only 60 seconds left.

2041
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:56,640
Yeah, give me the introduction.

2042
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,400
Damn.

2043
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:02,140
Oh, I do have a res if anyone dies.

2044
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:02,620
Oh, yeah.

2045
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:03,600
Oh, okay.

2046
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:04,080
Never mind.

2047
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,100
Too many people die.

2048
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,080
That's why I don't want to come back.

2049
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:08,940
No, I don't think so.

2050
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:09,540
I'm leaving.

2051
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:12,540
Oh, I'm behind them.

2052
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:13,680
I'm going to get rid of their res again.

2053
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,540
So wait, if I, if I E and don't use it, I heal over time.

2054
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:19,220
Yeah, if I E and don't use it, I damage boost over time?

2055
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,660
If you press F, you have damage boost over time, yeah.

2056
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,420
Is this damage?

2057
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,760
It's just just me.

2058
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:25,400
Yeah, it's just you.

2059
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:25,820
It's just you.

2060
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,980
I'm behind the whole team, so...

2061
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2062
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:29,820
They'll never know.

2063
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,340
There is a Mr. Fantastic on the card.

2064
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,940
This guy has rolled off from his team.

2065
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
He's getting no heals.

2066
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:36,500
Yeah, yeah.

2067
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:37,660
He can't die.

2068
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:38,520
He doesn't need heals.

2069
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:39,240
Good ball, Jay.

2070
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:39,920
I sold it.

2071
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,440
I got...

2072
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,000
I do have Rez in.

2073
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,780
I have Rez in fast.

2074
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,120
Yep, I'm helping.

2075
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:50,920
Nice.

2076
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:51,820
I'm Rez.

2077
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:53,220
Thank you, brother.

2078
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:53,800
Good stuff.

2079
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,160
Good stuff.

2080
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:54,920
I'm going to use mine here.

2081
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,140
Yeah, I'll use mine first.

2082
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:57,960
I'll use mine first.

2083
01:49:58,520 --> 01:49:59,080
Okay, okay.

2084
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,080
I don't think we need it yet.

2085
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,440
Maybe that's a monster.

2086
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:02,940
Nice.

2087
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:03,720
Okay.

2088
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,580
I'll let you go first, though, for sure.

2089
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:06,620
Yeah, you want to combo?

2090
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:07,320
Later.

2091
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:08,640
We can combo.

2092
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,720
I'm going to the top of the ropes, bro.

2093
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,400
Top of the ropes.

2094
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:13,400
I'm launching him now.

2095
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,300
I see that.

2096
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:15,720
You ready?

2097
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:16,780
Yeah.

2098
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,280
The moment they get close.

2099
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:19,840
Here you go.

2100
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:20,840
Throw it to you guys.

2101
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:22,640
That's one.

2102
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,580
I'm going to get the introduction.

2103
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,140
Oh.

2104
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:31,880
And you guys got it.

2105
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,080
You all got it.

2106
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:33,400
Nice.

2107
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:38,580
No.

2108
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:39,940
It's okay.

2109
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,460
She's still healing.

2110
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:41,960
She's not.

2111
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:42,920
Oh, she's almost dead.

2112
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:43,380
She's almost dead.

2113
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:44,760
I can't see you guys.

2114
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:46,900
Oh.

2115
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:47,780
Keep pulling me up.

2116
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:48,740
Oh.

2117
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,140
Oh, my God.

2118
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,380
Oh, my God.

2119
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:50,900
Oh, my God.

2120
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,880
Oh, my God.

2121
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:53,900
You're so healthy.

2122
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:54,580
He's getting spam healed.

Oh, my God.

2131
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:36,600
Look at, it's like a heel wall or a heel path.

2132
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:37,260
Look at my right arm.

2133
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:39,000
Look at my right arm on mag.

2134
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:39,700
Look at it.

2135
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:41,200
Why is it larger than your left arm?

2136
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,280
Well, that's all these extra cards.

I'm trying.

2166
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:36,920
I'm coming over.

I'm off map.

2175
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:43,760
I'm off map.

2176
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,200
Not for you.

2177
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:48,000
Use my webs.

2178
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:48,560
Use my webs.

2179
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:48,620
Use my webs.

2180
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:50,940
I'm back.

2181
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:51,980
We're back.

2182
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:52,400
We're fine.

2183
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:52,960
We're fine.

2184
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,540
I'm still in forever.

2185
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,000
Don't worry.

2186
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:57,340
I'm ripping off the second you open this up.

2187
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,340
No, no, no, don't tie.

2188
01:54:58,460 --> 01:54:59,140
They're not here yet.

2189
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:02,460
Everything is fine.

2190
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:03,380
I want to do too.

2191
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:03,820
We don't need to.

2192
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:04,380
We don't need to.

2193
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:05,240
We don't need to.

2194
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:05,880
We don't need to.

2195
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:06,940
We live.

2196
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:07,360
We live.

2197
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:08,380
That gross one.

2198
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:14,580
Okay, I think the rocket rest definitely heals.

2199
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:17,120
Massive.

2200
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:19,500
Yeah, Laz was standing on and he never died.

2201
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:20,220
Just have it.

2202
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,220
I have a turret if you guys back up.

2203
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,520
Angela's anti-yield.

2204
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:25,020
Right here, right here, right here.

2205
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:25,680
I can't kill him.

2206
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,940
Goodbye, Craigie.

2207
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:27,960
Are you going to live?

2208
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:29,120
Okay.

2209
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,220
I'm on a turret.

2210
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:31,680
It has to be.

2211
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:32,760
It's okay.

2212
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:33,420
Oh, you're going.

2213
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,140
Don't worry.

2214
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:34,640
Don't worry.

2215
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,480
Watch this.

2216
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,140
You can fight there forever now.

2217
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:37,900
You know what?

2218
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:39,580
Let's stack all the damage.

2219
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:40,760
Yeah, stack it up.

2220
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:41,280
Stack it up.

2221
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:41,720
Oh.

2222
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:42,300
Oh, my back on me.

2223
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:44,360
Oh.

2224
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,000
Only 60 seconds left.

2225
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:48,960
I point, I point.

2226
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,400
I'm not a classy week.

2227
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,220
See you nine, see nine.

2228
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:51,920
No, that's fine.

2229
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:52,260
It's fine.

2230
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:52,860
It's fine.

2231
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,160
We're too careful.

2232
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,160
I'm not meeting you, bro.

2233
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,500
It's you and me.

2234
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:58,080
Give me like.

2235
01:55:59,680 --> 01:55:59,880
Bro.

2236
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:02,620
See, I'm doing it.

2237
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:03,080
I'm doing it.

2238
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:03,180
I'm doing it.

2239
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,260
I'm doing it.

2240
01:56:05,620 --> 01:56:06,300
I'm telling you.

2241
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,100
Tyler's in the battle.

2242
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:08,520
Oh.

2243
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:11,320
What is he doing here?

2244
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:12,520
I got you out of second.

2245
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,080
I got you in a second.

2246
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:14,080
Yeah.

2247
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:14,780
I'm a main.

2248
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:16,480
I'm coming back.

2249
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:17,060
I need heals.

2250
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,000
I got you.

2251
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:18,240
I got you.

2252
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:18,440
I got you.

2253
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:18,840
I got you.

2254
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,280
I think we got you.

2255
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:21,320
I'm getting out.

2256
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:22,300
I'm getting out.

2257
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:26,080
Jim, come here, come here.

2258
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:29,000
Is it fat?

2259
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:29,420
Is it fat?

2260
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:30,360
I don't know.

2261
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:31,660
Yeah, yeah, sort of.

2262
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:32,200
I guess.

2263
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:33,040
No.

2264
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:35,860
It's okay.

2265
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:36,500
There's Nate.

2266
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:37,200
Oh, never mind.

2267
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:40,320
Why am I dead before you guys are?

2268
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,720
You're doing great.

2269
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,840
You're doing great, did you?

2270
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:45,520
This is crazy, bro.

2271
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:46,860
This is crazy.

2272
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:47,720
I'm going to make it.

2273
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,140
You have to keep fighting until we hide.

2274
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:51,440
It would actually go crazy into this cop the more I look at it.

2275
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:52,060
Oh my god.

2276
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:53,740
Yo, this is the ace up my sleeve.

2277
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:55,480
You'll never expect it.

2278
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:56,200
It's clobber in time.

2279
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,880
If only you were blue, though.

2280
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,180
Yeah, I didn't buy the battle pass.

2281
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:05,500
Tyler invited me, and I kind of panicked and locked up and didn't get the battle pass.

2282
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:06,780
That son of a bitch.

2283
01:57:08,420 --> 01:57:09,340
Mikey, you good, bro?

2284
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:09,980
No, bro.

2285
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:11,160
Hey, I'm Joey.

2286
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:11,520
I'm Joey.

2287
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,100
Dude, are you guys seeing all back?

2288
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:15,580
This mag is doing it.

2289
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:17,060
No, let's go in.

2290
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,700
No, that is actually targeted.

2291
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:21,260
It's actually a harassment right here.

2292
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:22,820
Bro, I got so low on this, guys.

2293
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,300
I don't know, man.

2294
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:26,980
I got you, bro.

2295
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:27,940
I told you, I'm protected.

2296
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,200
Watch this one.

2297
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:30,180
Watch this one on the way you got away.

2298
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,240
Thank you for saving my life.

2299
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:33,720
That was a really good bubble.

2300
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:35,220
No.

2301
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:35,920
Can I hold?

2302
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:37,680
I'm saying it.

2303
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:38,600
Nice.

2304
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:39,820
Oh, that's good.

2305
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:40,100
I got one.

2306
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:41,720
Big.

2307
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:45,060
Does thing have more health?

2308
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:45,800
Do I have more base health?

2309
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,420
Oh, my God.

2310
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,900
Did, oh, that's personal.

2311
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,100
That was definitely personal.

2312
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:54,360

I don't understand.

2315
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,140
How does he know?

2316
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:27,140
And I haven't died yet.

2317
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:28,920
I got you.

2318
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,380
I don't want to die.

2319
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:36,940
Oh my god, please, please, please.

2320
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,580
You're going to start knocking on my door.

2321
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,320
You're going to start knocking on my door.

2322
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:44,140
Guys, this is very hard gameplay of me chucking my name.

2323
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,480
I got freaking sucked by the healers and pulled.

2324
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,980
Okay, we're so healthy.

2325
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:51,780
We're so healthy.

2326
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:52,980
I've never been vulnerable in my life.

2327
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:53,240
Okay.

2328
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:55,220
Okay, I can't stop healing!

2329
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:56,660
I can't stop healing!

2330
01:58:57,700 --> 01:58:59,720
I can't heal you over there!

2331
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:00,000
Yeah.

2332
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,440
Oh my gosh.

2333
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:05,440
Oh no.

2334
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:07,620
Oh no.

2335
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:10,600
Oh no.

2336
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:10,800
Oh no.

2337
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:10,820
Oh no.

2338
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,060
Turn up.

2339
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,260
Turn up.

2340
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,080
It's okay.

2341
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:14,160
It's okay.

2342
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:14,480
It's okay.

2343
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:14,880
It's okay.

2344
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:15,240
It's okay.

2345
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:15,560
It's okay.

2346
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:16,600
We're so fine.

2347
01:59:16,700 --> 01:59:17,180
We're so fine.

2348
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:17,780
We're so fine.

2349
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:20,140
That's next to us.

2350
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:25,380
Okay.

2351
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,380
I didn't hit anyone.

2352
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:29,040
I hit the cart.

2353
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:29,960
It's bad.

2354
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:30,640
It's bad though.

2355
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,100
I'm bad.

2356
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:31,960
I'm ulting.

2357
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:32,520
Oh my god.

2358
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,140
He's got me.

2359
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,160
Shielding you off.

2360
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:37,180
Shielding you off.

2361
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,180
Hit me again.

2362
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:38,860
No!

2363
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:39,820
Yeah!

2364
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:40,920
Let's go!

2365
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:42,100
Let's go!

2366
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:44,400
Gambit is very fun, by the way.

2367
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:44,740
Yeah.

2368
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,180
Yes.

2369
01:59:46,460 --> 01:59:47,800
Super cool character.

bro.

2374
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,260
I feel like just playing action.

2375
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:24,000
I am in this woman.

2376
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:29,220
You know, guys, I have to play Blade, and I've never played a game on Blade.

2377
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:31,480
See, maybe they also have to play Blade.

2378
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,640
You'll be fine, bro.

2379
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:34,280
All right, here we go.

2380
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:36,280
So when you die, you spin again.

2381
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,340
That's how this works.

2382
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:39,460
Guys, I might have gotten Hella.

2383
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:40,960
Oh, no.

2384
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:41,520
It's over.

2385
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:42,440
It's over.

2386
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:42,900
It's over.

2387
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,300
Do not die.

2388
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:46,100
You don't die.

2389

2390
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:49,340
I'm not crazy, right?

2391
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:50,380
This shield's bigger, right?

2392
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:51,060
On Invis?

2393
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:51,880
Yeah, it is.

2394
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,140
It's only the self-shield, though.

2395
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,140
I'm pretty sure it's the same.

2396
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,900
No, no, you put it on someone else.

2397
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:00,740
Like, if you put the right click on someone, it's small.

2398
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,280
No, that's the F.

2399
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,240
That is not average.

2400
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,280
That's the F one.

2401
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,540
All right, so my E, I basically just want to run around in E form, right?

2402
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:08,920
Basically.

2403
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:12,120
No, your shotgun does great damage.

2404
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,540
That medium range.

2405
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,400
It's not a close, though.

2406
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:14,680
It's not enough close.

2407
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:15,560
How do I do my anti-channel?

2408
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,940
I can't believe Craigie got Hella, bro.

2409
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:18,100
How do I do my anti-channel?

2410
02:03:18,120 --> 02:04:27,620

Oh, no.

2414
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:16,480
We're okay.

2415
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:17,200
We're okay.

2416
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:17,780
We're okay.

2417
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:18,840
We're okay.

2418
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:20,680
Everything's fine.

2419
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,080
I have bubbles for you.

2420
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,320
I got Magneto.

2421
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:26,180
I got Mag.

2422
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:27,100
Oh, my God.

2423
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:28,080
You're cheating.

2424
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:28,620
It's over.

2425
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:30,180
We're slowly becoming meta.

2426
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:35,560
I'm going for flank boys.

2427
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:36,580
Yeah.

2428
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:37,260
Don't see me.

2429
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,560
We have a widow without her, without the Phoenix.

2430
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:45,660
And it's last was on widow, which I've never in my life.

2431
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:46,320
I believe it.

2432
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:47,060
So you've seen this.

2433
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:48,260
You don't know.

2434
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:49,280
I'm getting solo ulted.

2435
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:49,760
Some of you trolling.

2436
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:50,940
I'm actually getting trolled.

2437
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:51,840
I got solo ulted.

2438
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,380
You're hitting every shot.

2439
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:56,920
I've never played Daredevil.

2440
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,480
I got Daredevil.

2441
02:05:58,640 --> 02:05:59,340
I believe, I believe.

2442
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:01,520
Oh, my God.

2443
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:01,840
This is going to be terrible.

2444
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:04,620
Oh, I got it.

2445
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:05,140
I got it.

2446
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:05,440
Never mind.

2447
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,560
This movement is insane.

2448
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:07,040
I'm dead.

2449
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:07,680
Oh, my God.

2450
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,400
Oh, you're alive.

2451
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:11,520
You're alive.

2452
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:11,760
You're alive.

2453
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:12,060
You're alive.

2454
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:12,260
You're alive.

2455
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:12,280
You're alive.

2456
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:14,320
I love you too.

2457
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,060
I don't know what I'm doing.

2458
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:17,520
Yeah.

2459
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:18,820
I'm running out.

2460
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:21,080
Bye.

2461
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:21,520
I'm dead.

2462
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:22,500
That was their hello.

2463
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:23,160
That's my bad.

2464
02:06:25,940 --> 02:06:26,800
Oh, I have no idea.

2465
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,380
I have no idea.

2466
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:28,700
I needed to get off that character immediately.

2467
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:29,440
That was terrible.

2468
02:06:32,020 --> 02:06:32,780
Here's the thing.

2469
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:33,880
Oh, oh my gosh.

2470
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:35,220
I'm being followed everywhere.

2471
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,220
You got thing?

2472
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:36,520
Okay.

2473
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:37,060
This is good.

2474
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,200
This is good.

2475
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:40,000
You're spinning the wheel.

2476
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:41,920
I'm waiting for whoever comes out.

2477
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:45,380
I'm waiting.

2478
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:45,680
I'm waiting.

2479
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:47,540
Wait, nobody came out.

2480
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:49,900
Wait, it's Widow.

2481
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:50,760
They have Widow.

2482
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:54,600
She doesn't know I'm right behind her.

2483
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:56,940
She's so stupid.

2484
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:00,940
I have no idea what's happening.

2485
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:02,220
I just popped my freaking healing.

2486
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:03,180
We got points.

2487
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:05,180
Oh my god.

2488
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,340
Oh my god.

2489
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:08,560
I just drank this already.

2490
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:10,580
Yes!

2491
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:14,700
I'm spinning.

2492
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,060
What did I get?

2493
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:21,480
Okay, I got Wolverine.

2494
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,440
All right, this is...

2495
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:22,960
Oh, huge.

2496
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:23,660
I don't know.

2497
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,740
I'm going to be zoning.

2498
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:27,880
I have to walk back.

2499
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:29,020
I'm going to be a zoner.

2500
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:31,520
We are only healers low-key right now.

2501
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:31,940
Oh, my God.

2502
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:33,280
I didn't say it.

2503
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:33,300
He didn't.

2504
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:34,000
I should probably heal you guys.

2505
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,740
Yeah, yeah, my back.

2506
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,600
Just copy, cloak.

2507
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:38,200
Crackers.

2508
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:40,180
You got to copy their cloak from you.

2509
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:42,800
I got you.

2510
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:43,320
I got you.

2511
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:43,600
I got you.

2512
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2513
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:46,200
Oh, my God, they have Gambit all too.

2514
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:47,480
Cranky, Massimo!

2515
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,860
Where are you all in my attack too?

2516
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,480
Good game, good!

2517
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,760
It's over, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done!

2518
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:58,500
Someone roll it, get strange!

2519
02:07:58,740 --> 02:07:59,820
Someone roll it, get strange!

2520
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,080
Are we winning?

2521
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,800
No, we are not!

2522
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:04,900
I'm gonna roll strange!

2523
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:05,740
I'm Luna!

2524
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:10,000
I said, I said I got Bruce, I didn't get Hulk, so does that mean I never Hulk?

2525
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,220
Wait, you just never?

2526
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:12,940
What, does that?

2527
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:13,860
I said, Bruce!

2528
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,240
Is there even Hulk in there?

2529
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:17,700
It said Bruce!

2530
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:20,180
Oh my god, we're cooked.

2531
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:23,140
There's no way Bruce is an option on this wheel, right?

2532
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:23,640
No way?

2533
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:25,500
It says Bruce Banner.

2534
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:26,940
Oh my god.

2535
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,740
There's literally no hook in the wheel.

2536
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:31,360
I got Captain America.

2537
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:33,220
I got Adam Boyle.

2538
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:34,260
It says Bruce.

2539
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:35,520
I'm going by the rules.

2540
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:37,320
Alright, it's time.

2541
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:39,080
The best Bruce in the world.

2542
02:08:39,740 --> 02:08:40,780
Okay, am I the only healer?

2543
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:41,220
Wait, me?

2544
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:41,540
Okay.

2545
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:42,240
No, no, no, no.

2546
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:42,800
We have Adam.

2547
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:43,340
Wait, wait, wait.

2548
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,900
This is a composition is insane.

2549
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:47,340
Just get on the point.

2550
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:52,660
Yo, we got to get Craigie set up on the point and we can just all stand in the webs and heal.

2551
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:53,800
This could actually work really well.

2552
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:56,600
I'll do bond for us too.

2553
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:59,180
I don't really know.

2554
02:08:59,360 --> 02:08:59,840
I mean, I know.

2555
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:00,760
Wait, what's my C?

2556
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:01,860
What is this?

2557
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:03,440
Life's deal.

2558
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:05,040
Oh, yeah, it does life's deal.

2559
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,040

I got Thor again.

2615
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:34,820
My years away from the Avengers taught me how much they meant to me.

2616
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:35,980
Do you guys see this?

02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:41,500
I don't I don't buy that bro There's nothing we could do.

2631
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:47,420
I don't buy that they spun the tank off of it He got a real cop.

2632
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:48,700
It's not our fault.

2633
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:54,380
Yeah, we won the games that matter, guys.

2634
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:55,840
We did.

2635
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:56,320
We did.

2636
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:56,980
Yeah.

2637
02:12:57,580 --> 02:12:59,920
We didn't think we won the games that people were trying on their characters on.

2638
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:00,620
Exactly.

2639
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:04,020
That gross even went Spider-Man and we still won.

2640
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:05,100
Several times.

2641
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:07,460
Oh, that's a win, bro.

I'm leaving.

2656
02:13:57,620 --> 02:13:58,500

I told you.

2658
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:03,920
He fucking knows when I'm, like, in an intense game.

2659
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:05,120
He knows.

2660
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:08,700
And then we're here to fuck around.

2661
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:09,560
We're losing.

2662
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:11,080
And he's like, I'm not bothering you.

2663
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,120
I'm not going to bother you now.

2664
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,360
Anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed the season 5 preview.

2665
02:14:18,080 --> 02:14:20,040
I guess I also showed up Battle Pass.

2666
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,520
Jorn got stealing his idea.

2667
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:24,460
But let's see.

2668
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:28,760
Here is the Battle Pass for those who want to see it.

2669
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:31,580
Here's the cool-ass skin and the intro.

2670
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,260
And then there's Groot.

2671
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:34,580
And then there's...

2672
02:14:34,580 --> 02:14:35,780
I like this highlight intro.

2673
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:37,420
I'm not like a huge fan of...

2674
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:39,520
I mean, I think the Frankencast was pretty good.

2675
02:14:39,580 --> 02:14:42,620
But I like the highlight intro in general for Frankencast.

2676
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:43,900
I think it's really cool.

2677
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:54,040
and um yeah I think I like the idea that he's breaking out of the TV it's like 3d shit and this one's my favorite he's blue what if the thing was blue what

2678
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:46,240
what if he was blue it was wild what if he was blue um anyway guys uh please make sure to check out mob arrivals season 5 on November 14th um like I said please click on the link pinned in my chat or in the panel it really does help out stream a lot huge shout out again to marvel rivals devs for sponsoring me uh for the early access i really appreciate it as a vtuber representation um in the in um in the uh early access preview group um it does mean a lot it's such a huge honor um as always when they uh when they ask me to do these things um and you know i get to play with a lot of really cool people too uh but yeah the game is always updating it is free to play remember all heroes are free to play you don't there's no special requirement And there's always new updates coming in non-stop,

But thank you, everyone.

2681
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:53,120
Thank you for all the subs, the bitties, the follows, the raids.

2682
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,080
Thank you, everyone, for the raid.

2683
02:15:54,260 --> 02:16:02,180
I'm sorry I wasn't able to thank you guys for the raid because I was so in the zone for the early access preview because it was that, you know, it was sponsored, so I had to make sure I got everything.

2684
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:08,540
I know some people were asking me because Iron Mouse and Sea Dog announced a VTuber Rivals Cup, and you're like, oh, are you in it?

2685
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:12,660
I asked the devs, like, oh, can I be in it?

2686
02:16:12,660 --> 02:16:13,700
and they're like, yeah, you're in.

2687
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:16,080
So, um, from what I know, I'm in.

2688
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:17,380
I don't have any details yet.

2689
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:23,520
Like, I didn't have, I wasn't sent anything yet, but the devs told me that I'm in the VTuber, uh, rivalous thing.

2690
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:24,580
That's all I know.

2691
02:16:24,760 --> 02:16:27,300
Like, they just told me that I'm in it.

2692
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:28,260
That's all I know.

2693
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:30,240
I wasn't sent any, like, invite or any more details.

2694
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:31,160
They just said I'm in it.

2695
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:38,380
Like, so, Gambit is definitely, I think I played Gambit too much, like, a healer.

2696
02:16:38,720 --> 02:17:40,600
I feel like I had to play him, I have like more for for like damage as well um so gabbit was very hard to juggle in terms of like you have your mind has to be like on 24 7 because like you gotta know your research you have to do really good resource management and you have to play both like be able to balance both styles seems really really difficult just because like you know you have to know when to use the anti-heal or like the vulnerability one because he does the vulnerability too um like the for the damage card he either has vulnerability or anti-heal so you gotta be able to balance the two and the cleanse too yeah like you gotta be able to um know when to use the heal and when you need to use the cleanse too because you know you have to reflex the cleanse as well um so it is very apparently i was told that his cleanse can cancel Groot ult if you time it correctly so like that's crazy like that can negate an entire Groot ult if you time it correctly though only if you time it can

2697
02:17:40,600 --> 02:18:43,900
do that uh yeah so that's what i was told so um maybe i'm spreading fake news you guys can try it out too but uh yeah that's a whole team fight uh deny but i was told that um so um you guys can try it out yourselves later on the 14th um and you guys can see how freaking strong it is um it was in the trailer oh it was in the trailer yeah in the trailer he cleansed the grudal basically no that's crazy that's scary that's a entire team fight god you're right you're that's very scary hey guys if you guys want to check me out more um please feel free to follow me on twitter i usually announce whenever i'm streaming on uh whenever i'm streaming on twitch on twitter or if i have like sponsors like this on twitter um they want if you enjoy my content please follow me on youtube because that's where i usually do my mainstreaming stuff um like i said YouTube is my main platform so please check me out on YouTube um um you can see in chat the commands are all there um to check me out there
