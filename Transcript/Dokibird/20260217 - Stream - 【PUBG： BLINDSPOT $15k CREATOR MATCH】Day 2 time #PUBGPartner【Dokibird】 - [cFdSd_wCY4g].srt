00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,160

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,080
I'm live!

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,060
Hello everybody!

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:14,940
We are watching a concert, but before we begin, I want to
say a huge thank you to PUBG Blindspot for today's sponsor.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,260
We are here for day two!

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,460
Oh wait, oh my god, I hear myself.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,220
Give me a sec.

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,380

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,080
Let me fix that real quick.

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:38,800
Anyway, we are watching a concert, a pre-recorded concert of
the music for, uh, that was just the echo was me.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,860
Um, I had my own tab out.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,980
So we are watching a pre-recorded concert of the music for
PUBG that was at the, that was being played at the studio.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,860
Um, uh, so my, I told my teammates, I told them like, uh,
hey, it will be around 40 minutes so our first game starts,

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,660
uh, and then And they're like, all right, peace.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,520
They're like, all right, we'll be back in 20 to 30 minutes.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,180
Peace.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,920
I was like, okay, that's cool.

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,280
No, no, I get it.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,320
I get it, though.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,440
That's why I'm alone.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,080
That's why I'm alone in the PC right now.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,880
They're like, bro, we're not starting.

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,480
We're not starting yet.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,600
I was like, no, we just, you gotta wait a little bit.

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,640
Like, all right, peace.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
Fades away.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,620

be like when's the first game I was like we still have we

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,400
I miss pretty sick music.

32
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,740
Also, is the music loud enough?

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,740
I don't know.

34
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,260
Bum-bum-bum.

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,460
Bum-bum.

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,300
Yeah, and then I told them.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,680
I told them, like, guys, I would really love to make it to
the next round.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,880
Because if I get knocked out, I will still have the B.

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Don't keep coming back.

40
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,640

The life of shame.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,100
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,480
Thank you.

52
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,180
Thank you.

53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,060
It's like you let your teammates go, Doki.

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,220
The accident wasn't your fault.

55
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,460
Actually, I think I was the one that got most friendly fired
out of everybody.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,380
Other than Heavenly.

57
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,120
I felt our Gomes.

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,120
I feel like I was getting the most friendly fired.

59
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,180
But thank you for the super chat, Gus.

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,560
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,060
Thank you.

62
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,380
Fair enough.

63
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,080
But the drummer's going fucking hard right now.

64
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,180
If I'm not last, guys.

65
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,040
Not last.

66
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,320
That's for sure.

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,380
Wait, nobody else is in the team voice.

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,400
Like...

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,780
Why is it...

70
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,460
Why am I...

71
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,580

00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,940

Oh, no.

88
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,720
The main broadcast is handled by the production company.

89
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,320
So, um.

90
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,680
So, it's just me.

91
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
It's just me on YouTube.

92
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,620
My POV is on YouTube and the main broadcast.

93
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,360
We're a team.

94
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,560
Our first match is to start until maybe an hour.

95
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,740
So, um, I gave them a little bit of, I gave them a lunch
break.

96
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,800
Because I'd feel bad, you know.

97
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,240
They're just waiting here.

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I was like, you guys don't have to stick around until our
first match.

99
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,160
And they were like, bet, peace.

100
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,160
No hesitation.

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,660
They're like, all right, bye.

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,420
Hey, but guys, free rave.

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,420
Free rave.

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,940
I mean, I'd feel bad, though, you know, waiting, uh, waiting
for an hour.

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,160
So I just, you know, gave them a lunch break before then, a
little recess.

106
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,300
Yeah,

107
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,720
this is apparently a, like, performance after, at the
office.

108
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,420
Oh, yeah, for those who are curious, This is on the main
broadcast, which is on my Twitch channel.

109
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:22,560
But the reason why there's no archive, there's no VOD of it
is because this is from, you know, it is from Crafton, which

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
is like the GameStyle is located in Korea.

111
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,840
And because of that, Twitch has like this thing where if
they see any connection from Korea, they're not allowed to

112
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,920
store any broadcast.

113
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:44,820
from Korean IP so that's why there was no archive I was very
confused too yeah I was just like we're just like where

114
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:53,260
where did the VODs go and then we were like they're like did
you delete it I was like I'm pretty sure I didn't delete it

115
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:03,740
I didn't barely touch my twitch and I googled it and I was
like oh it's a twitch regulation thing yeah I was like I'm

116
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,660
sorry no I didn't delete it I I swear.

117
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,660
I was like, I swear to God.

118
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,970
Also,

119
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:49,710
I'm like debating if I stream, if I do a Lunar New Year
stream tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because like

120
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,730
tomorrow is lunar new year but like i really want to go to a
lunar new year festival because i haven't gone to one in a

121
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:03,470
very very long time i want to see the line dance live i've
been getting super nostalgic and stuff but they usually last

122
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:12,150
like all the way tonight too i have something planned for a
lunar new year it's something really fun um but it's like I

123
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,050
feel like...

124
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,530
Yeah, I really want to go to a Lunar New Year festival.

125
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,590
So I'm debating whether or not to do it tomorrow or the day
after tomorrow.

126
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,990
Because I need to check the dates, too, to see, like...

127
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,270
I know, like, there's one on the 17th.

128
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,670
But, like, I want to see if there's...

129
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,510
Because I know there's some festivals that are, like,
multi-day.

130
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,730
So I'm going to check it out.

131
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,790
If there's multi-day, then I'll do a Lunar New Year stream
tomorrow.

132
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,330
But if it isn't, if it's just tomorrow, then I'll just do it
tomorrow.

133
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,250
um abyssal thank you the super chat thank you thank you yes
it is my twitch channel if you go to to my main broadcast

134
00:09:50,250 --> 00:10:02,070
would be a jokie bird uh twitch.tv slash jokie bird that is
the main broadcast uh so uh so yeah that's where the main

135
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:11,270
like povs are but i don't want to i want to see the lions
eat a cabbage and then give me good luck because apparently

136
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,670
like the symbol for them eating cabbages is that they bring
you good luck and good fortune.

137
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,050
They're spinning like if they're like I remember when the
cabbages are like good luck and good fortune.

138
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,150
Festival then stream.

139
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,390
Yeah but then it'll be really late.

140
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,010
I don't like streaming too late for you guys.

141
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:42,630
Like by the time I come back from the festival it'd be like
super duper late and also I might be very tired I'm craving

142
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,950
I've been craving mingao mingo mingo.

143
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,050
I almost like like merged Cantonese and Mandarin together.

144
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,430
Oh my god.

145
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:58,030
I love mingo They're so good It's like it's like it's
basically like rice cakes

146
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:12,610
I missed those Especially when you do like scrambled eggs
and honestly I hope so you back This is like their own

147
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,530
personal concert after like lunch break.

148
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,530
I noticed that they're like eating lunch and there's like...

149
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,490
Yeah, you can see like PUBG in the background.

150
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:21,950
It's not over.

151
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,610
We haven't even gotten to the PUBG blind spot songs yet,
Mark.

152
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,870
Wait, this isn't a PUBG blind spot song?

153
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,510
What songs are they playing?

154
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,730
I feel like playing, Mark.

155
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,610
I feel like playing.

156
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,570
That's what I'm feeling like.

157
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,030
No, you can't play.

158
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,810
The lunch concert.

159
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,310
Yeah, wait.

160
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,210

Oh, yes.

165
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,870
Oh, it's from PUBG.

166
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,430
Yeah, I see the PUBG decorations in the back.

167
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,090
All right, I'll pay a little bit more for you guys.

168
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,190
Oh my god, the beat drop!

169
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:57,770
I'm waiting for the drop!

170
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,790
When's the drop?

171
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,970
Yeah, idiot.

172
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,330
You guys don't know.

173
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,210
Oh my god.

174
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,030
It's actually recorded inside the beat drop.

175
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:15,450
But Mark has actually been, and he keeps telling me, office
when the beat drop live performance to everyone that's

183
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,290
I'm so tired.

184
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,220
Build up.

185
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,740
Dragoon Raid at 3 p.m.

186
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Let's go!

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,500
The earliest time for the rave.

188
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,440
I don't know.

189
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,720
I don't know.

190
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,460
I don't know.

191
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,120
But that drummer is having a time of his life right now.

192
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,040
No, this is pre-recorded.

193
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,780
It's not live.

194
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,980
Because then it would be like...

195
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,940
Really early for like...

196
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,380
Wait, what time would it be right now in Korea if this was
supposedly live?

197
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,960
I feel so bad for everyone.

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Like, we gotta do this concert at...

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,900
Yeah, it would be like 8 a.m.

200
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,040
8 a.m.

201
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,560

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240

Yeah, yeah, it's a lot.

204
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,020

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,260
6 a.m.

206
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,200
or 8 a.m.

207
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,620
breakfast rave.

208
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Yeah, I was like, guys, maybe like 8 a.m.

209
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,480

210
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,380

Thank you, thank you.

213
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,980

context.

214
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,160

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800

Now you can drop me.

297
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,460
I mean, don't drop the cash.

298
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,380

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,900
You see them?

341
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,240
They're like right next to the amps.

342
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,240
The

343
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,050
YAP does not stop.

344
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,910
They gotta finish their deadlines.

345
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,640
Is the drum even connected?

346
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,720
I'm pretty sure.

347
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,980
Look, all these cables around his drum.

348
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,420
They forgot to plug it in or something.

349
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,740
Oh, shit.

350
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,080
Oh, my God, a mini drum.

True, true.

Where's the process team?

408
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,870
They're probably getting yelled at separately.

409
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,790
Oh, yeah, they might be, like, at the principal's office
right now.

410
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,990
No, they're in the bathroom, like, smoking the shit right
now.

411
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,090
Do you guys really believe that this voice chat is
end-to-end encrypted?

412
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,510
I don't know.

413
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,590
I'm not sure about that.

414
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,190
Absolutely not.

415
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,270
What does that mean?

416
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,290
Our FBI agents are listening right now.

417
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,910
Which one's yours?

418
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:24,810

actually give your face no okay i was gonna say people are

419
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:30,670
using like it's a big deal it's not like they couldn't find
it on the internet if they wanted to you could just be like

420
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:38,450
just google it bro dude basically you didn't have to do the
age of verification it means they have all the data in other

421
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,710
social media platforms

422
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:48,530
oh yeah i was gonna say i already gave all my info to google
What else do they need from me?

423
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,750
All right, Discord, check it out.

424
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:56,330
You can just ask us what year we were born, and everybody's
honest, and they'll just tell you the truth, and clearly

425
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,130
we're all...

426
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,990
I never lied to Steam once.

427
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,570
That reminds me of that one clip of Gabe Newell talked
about.

428
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:07,050
It's a surprising amount of people are born in April, so
just no one changes the month.

429
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,490
That's awesome.

430
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,090
They only change the year.

431
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,210
No, ultimate game in speech is when he talks about realism.

432
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:27,650
that's true that's true it's unrealistic be like who gives a
fuck i've never cared oh wait how's the concert is it gas

433
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:36,950
yeah it's pretty yes it's an edm concert in the office are
they playing a sandstorm no they're playing their ocs yeah

434
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:49,380

anywhere oh the oh yeah yeah like i already have the game

435
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:57,660

it from heavenly though come on that's my headphones are

436
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:06,720
loud enough and we threw the mic like three times you know
it's much more impressive than this music that you got all

437
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,560
of those chords to go to the right places and none of them
glitched and everything's working that's pretty impressive

438
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,760
oh breaking everything that's a lot of words i just opened
the game up i just opened the game up you hear that man it

439
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:32,090
out bam bam bam bam bam but is everyone i lowered the
concert a little bit and then up them up more is that better

440
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,970
guys can you guys hear them is this because sure force
sometimes talks quietly but then when he's locked He's like

441
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,150
loud.

442
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,270
The drummer goes hard in the concert.

443
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,390
Has anyone even tried Zen yet?

444
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,510
Actually, I don't think anyone has, right?

445
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,390
Try what?

446
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,270
The new mouse?

447
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,090
No, not the new mouse.

448
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,350
The character Zen.

449
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,370
Oh, the Zen!

450
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,590
I don't think so.

451
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,890
I don't think I've seen anyone in this tournament play it
yet.

452
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,510
I don't think so.

453
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,650
I think they play actual good characters.

454
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:21,770
oh god no i feel like i feel like we're sleeping on zen i
try it they have a sticky grenade launcher yeah but then

455
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:29,690
there's friendly fire yes i'm pretty sure none of us are
gonna accidentally yeah wait wait does the barbed wire

456
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:39,110
damage you no it like it makes noise it makes noises so you
know if anyone's like flanking to like certain spots and

457
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,410
slows yeah yeah and make sure I saw that on Twitter.

458
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,590
They're calling us a Fortnite lobby ad team.

459
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,190
But we kind of are a Fortnite lobby man.

460
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,330
We are pretty much, yeah.

461
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,130
Yeah, I feel like this is the only time we're all together
here.

462
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,110
Where is this guy looking where he's finding these comments?

463
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,130
Smash Bros.

464
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,150
ass team, bro.

465
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,090
Everyone's here.

466
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,350
This guy said, I don't want to use Twitter.

467
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,950
And now he's talking about people calling us Fortnite lobby.

468
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,710
No, I absolutely use Twitter.

469
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,330
I just don't use it till the end of the day.

470
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,150
I save that dopamine for the evening.

471
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,070
Yeah, he saves the doom scrolling.

472
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,850
One hour before you wake, or not before you wake up, one
hour before you go to sleep, one hour after you wake up, and

473
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,510
then that's it.

474
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,590
Also, could you guys hear them earlier when the concert
music was a bit too loud, guys?

475
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,270
I wasn't sure.

476
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,830
Were you guys able to hear everybody?

477
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,170
I'm just like, iPad kid.

478
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,470
There's got to be more here.

00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,510
There's got to be more here.

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,970
Wow, wow.

What a performance.

482
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,210
One more time.

483
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,470
No, but what if you just had a kid?

484
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,530
It's so much fun.

485
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,370
Then you could just go upstairs and just like, he will grab
your face and squeeze it not knowing that that hurts like

486
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:54,830
that's so much more fun than fooling around on a phone right
I don't think I'll ever get to feel that man I don't think

487
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:05,510
I'll have a kid oh my god what happened I'm physically
unking testicular torsion on stream without getting in

best way I could oh my condolences bro I'm Sorry, man.

Yeah, you know, one side exists.

491
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:28,090
It's like, you know, sort of, instead of like two ping pong
balls, he has one.

492
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,990
No, it doesn't work.

493
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,710
They're just dead?

494
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,350
They're just dead there?

495
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,150

It can happen at any moment.

607
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,510
Yeah, guys, let's start.

608
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,490
Damn, there's somebody in here that speaks Korean English.

609
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:37,730
English and Chinese that's super impressive yeah even even
oh no it's happening again oh

610
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:51,890
no oh no I think it's just you man oh I think it's just me
with gig up gig down and like a long stream that only gods

611
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:59,010
could dream of owning yeah it's definitely me thank you
Discord so what is different in our stream I wonder oh I

612
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:03,750
have it boosted out the with pink crystals because I'm like
that.

613
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,490
I forgot about the boost.

614
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,990
The boost may be giving us perks this whole time.

615
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,910
Oh, I need some of that.

616
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,890
But the boost might be giving us perks.

617
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,530
But I just chose to bust out my wrist to just boost this
server for no reason.

618
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,770
I don't know.

619
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,710
Just get it one boost, come on, one boost won't hurt.

620
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:24,310
Oh wait, can't you just move like the boost that you already
have so you don't have to spend money?

621
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,730
Yeah, so there's no one else that's going to exist after
tomorrow.

622
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:28,570
What the heck?

623
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,270
No, it's going to exist in here.

got to get back a win.

657
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:30,050
So I told my team, I was like, guys, we have to make it past
this round because I have to still stream.

658
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,430
we get knocked out.

659
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:37,670
So please, I do not want to do the walk of shame and
continue to be live after getting knocked out of my own

660
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,130
tournament.

661
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,110
So please.

662
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,630
And then my team was like, well, just gotta get your ones.

663
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:49,250
And I was like, guys, we have to have a better strategy than
getting our ones, guys.

664
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:50,790
No, you're right.

665
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:51,970
You just gotta get your twos.

666
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,850
And I'm like, okay, that's fine, I guess.

667
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,630
So that's our strategy.

668
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,110
We each gotta get our ones, and then we'll win, I guess.

669
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,850
Well, we saw you in strategy.

670
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,390
I was listening back to your Vardin.

671
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,290
In the breaks, you were talking about strategy.

672
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,150
Look, final question for me, though.

673
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,670
Are you changing anything up today, though, coming into the
semi-finals?

674
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,950
Or is it just about getting your ones and getting a kill and
moving on?

675
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:19,130
Apparently, we're just going to try and get our ones, and
then we'll see how that goes.

676
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,010
Maybe we'll adapt on the fly.

677
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,050
We'll see.

678
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:24,270
That's the beauty of our team.

679
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,590
We don't know what we're doing.

680
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,490
And if the team doesn't know what we're doing, then we
won't.

681
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:36,570
win I guess like if they don't know what we're doing well
look Doki bird I'm gonna take it I've got a love and leave

682
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:42,010
you because you need to get ready you need to get yourself
in a lobby so best of luck we'll see you though on the

683
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:47,870
battleground shortly get out of here go do some prep work

685
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:07,770
attracted to the conversation what about rem what we even
say huh i don't even remember what conversation oh yeah that

686
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:14,310
we were talking about anything interesting apparently i'm
kill leader oh you're kill leader right now yeah apparently

687
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:21,170
i'm kill leader well you guys of all the team kills wait
like on our team or like overall because you have to be

688
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:27,910
overall oh shit okay well you keep getting the kills And
then heavenly is number is number number three.

689
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,470
34 kills.

690
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,470
Wait, oh, where am I?

691
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,290
Where am I?

692
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:35,610
Yeah.

693
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,190
I think there's a separate page.

694
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,130
I think I think there's a separate page for that.

695
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,550
Like what about what about badger?

696
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,050
Is he on the top?

697
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,150
I think there's another page for that one.

698
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:51,270
You're just gonna just skin me alive like that when you know
the numbers not that high.

699
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,230
I gotta drag you down with me, bro.

700
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:01,530
know at least if we lose it's because our kill leader isn't
getting his three exactly if we had two of the top 10 top

701
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:10,170
three kill leaders and we're still losing like okay i have i
want to say secret but we have to like it's either we when

702
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:16,710
we lose or we win the whole thing a secret that i am so
surprised that i'm kill leader with my with my current

703
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:26,370
condition that i just learned yesterday because i should not
i should not be what rsi What the fuck is that?

704
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:27,590
What's RSI?

705
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,290
That's what you get when your hand is hurting.

706
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,510
Oh no, it's worse.

707
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:33,850
You know what, should I just say no?

708
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:34,590
I fuck it, whatever.

709
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:38,570
Yeah, apparently my wrist has been fractured for like six
weeks.

710
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:39,730
Yeah.

711
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:40,470
Fractured?

712
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,070
Yeah, yeah.

713
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:41,810
Yeah.

714
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,930
Yeah, apparently I've been playing with a fractured wrist
this entire time.

715
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,110
I'm ranked 12.

716
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:48,530
You're?

717
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,350
Let's go!

718
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,710
Doki's rank 17.

719
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,710
Don't shut the fuck up.

720
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,470
I'm confused.

721
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,310
I'm confused.

722
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,970
No, Badger's ranked 13 right behind me.

723
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:07,330
Bruh.

724
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,710
Okay, but all right.

725
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:18,070
So, so if any of us is kill leader, which obviously won't be
me, I'm not including there, but I don't think I could catch

726
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:23,670
up, but you guys can win $1,000 individually if you get kill
leader.

727
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,270
I don't think I want to even give him wire transfer
instructions for my corporation.

728
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:29,610
I'll just give it to you.

729
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,470
I'm just going to down them and let Gomez finish them off.

730
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,310
You guys are going to be dead.

731
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:35,870
No, you're going to.

732
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,590
But he needs the 1K for his surgery.

733
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,410
No, no.

734
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,790
I'm pretty sure I'm getting a cast.

735
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,170
I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen.

736
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:42,990
How did you even fracture that, John?

737
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,710
I went to Guatemala and I slipped and I fell on my wrist.

738
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,670
I thought you were going to stop there.

739
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,450
No.

740
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,590
Oh, no, I went to Guatemala.

741
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,530
You're supposed to say you put something on your wrist so
heavy and diamond encrusted.

742
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,750
that it hit the ground and you fractured your wrist.

743
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,450
I had too much ice on my wrist.

744
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,170
It was too heavy, bro.

745
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,190
You bust down your wrist way too hard.

746
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,670
It kind of, no, I'm not going to say it.

747
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,330
No, it's just, I fell and I just like, like all my way on
it.

748
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,030
You're literally knuckle dragging on the ground when you
walk.

749
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,110
Can't even have my wrist in the sun, bro.

750
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,350
I'll get blinded by all this ice.

751
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,090
Oh my God.

752
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:22,110
Oh my God.

753
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,290
Oh my God.

754
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:33,830
I thought I thought my whole condition was just was was
carpal tunnel that was wrong yeah you just have a fractured

755
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:41,890
bone in your in your arm dumbass dumbass American hospital

jump i have my game alt tab so i don't hear the

759
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,110

I know you wanted that McChicken.

775
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,620
The dollar value hasn't been the thing for like 10 years.

776
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,700
I don't know if you know that.

777
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,540
Hey, McChicken's still under $5.

778
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
It's like, it's like three.

779
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,760
That's still enough.

780
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,060
With some change.

781
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:59,420

Fun K.

790
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:37,610

more damaged.

00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,210
The potential to get $1,000.

00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:56,330
Good motion.

817
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:57,910
Here, Lord had us.

818
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,010
I'm gonna sit here in the corner.

819
00:57:59,170 --> 00:57:59,650
Yeah, that works.

820
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:00,090
Where I hear.

821
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,110
There's no, you can be wall banging.

822
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:01,990
That is not right.

823
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:02,350
I know.

824
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,170
Right here.

825
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,490
The most timing of timing ever.

826
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,570
I knew I should have just fucking held that angle.

827
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,030
They got motion.

828
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:10,450
They got motion.

829
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:12,990
Okay.

830
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,170
Come on, reload, reload my gun.

831
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,730
Oh, I got my gun.

832
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:18,250
I got my gun.

833
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:18,730
I got my gun.

834
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,410
I'm left.

835
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,270
I got you.

836
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,150
Oh, my god.

837
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:21,770
There's one more way.

838
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:22,710
Two more, two more, two more.

839
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:23,450
Let's go.

840
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:24,970
Motion!

841
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:26,530
What the hell?

842
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,450
I was picking my nose for a while.

843
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,410
I was like checking out my M4.

844
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:31,950
I was doing a lot of stupid shit.

845
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,790
I should have shot them one.

846
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,010
You guys don't want to know what happened to me.

847
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,750
You don't want to know what happened to me.

848
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:44,410
I heard something on my flank, and I was holding the angle,
and then as soon as I move to jump through the window, he

849
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,090
starts peaking.

850
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,810
It wasn't even like he heard me moving.

851
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,190
It was like, it was the exact moment I decided to stop
holding the angle.

852
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,250
He peaked.

853
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:58,910
I was so used to the guy I played yesterday that my full
auto gun was semi-auto for a bit there.

854
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,110
So I was like, man, I'm missing way too many shots.

855
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,470
What the hell going on?

856
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,390
Okay, now, how about this?

857
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:05,710
How about this?

858
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:09,010
Now, instead of going, because now they're going to
anticipate it.

859
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:09,350
Okay.

860
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,830

866
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:48,310
I got the juice.

867
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,370
It's something we all want to hit.

01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:01,390
He's over here.

01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:01,570

I have my shield.

888
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,790
My RNG sniper rifle missed.

889
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,630
No, you have to zoom in again, remember?

890
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:11,550

900
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,170
You're defusing the bomb!

901
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,470
I have a shield.

902
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,510
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

903
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,850

01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:36,670
Okay, going.

906
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,090
That's fine.

907
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:39,890
You're gonna probably fire.

908
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:40,390
Just be careful.

909
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:41,690
That's fine, that's fine.

910
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,330
You have another rooster?

911
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,490
They're halfway through the bomb.

912
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,150
They're halfway through.

913
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:45,730
2v1.

914
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:46,350
2v1.

915
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:48,750
Wow!

916
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,050
Just get us that one drag!

917
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:53,150
This is opiates.

918
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,130
This is so stupid.

919
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,130
Maybe I should hate you.

920
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:58,970
This is opiates.

921
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,610
I'll turn on my teammates purple.

922
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,270
I mean, yeah, bro.

923
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,710
I should be gassing everybody up.

924
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:04,970
Just so that way y'all can win.

925
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,250
Let's go kill leaders!

926
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:10,530
I tried to wall bang someone.

927
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:11,190
It didn't work.

928
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,910
And then he just randomly shot through the wall.

929
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,410
kill me.

930
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:21,590
It's going to work eventually.

931
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,290
I would have had two freaking kills by now.

932
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,170
Okay, do we do the same thing again?

933
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:31,290
I kind of like landings that are outskirts to like bent
hallway.

934
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,190
See bent hallway?

935
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:33,190
That looks like a fairly...

936
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,530
Oh, I like that.

937
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:34,410
I like that.

938
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:34,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:36,990
And we push through...

940
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,750
We go...

941
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:38,270
Bless you.

942
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:39,010
We...

943
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,390
Then we go through supply room.

944
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:42,270

There's one to your right.

01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:17,930
There's one to your right.

954
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:18,730
Oh, what?

955
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:19,830
There's one here.

956
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,330
There's one here, guys.

957
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:21,550
What?

958
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,170
Did I get shot in the back?

959
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:24,110
We'll get one.

960
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:25,470
Okay, okay.

961
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:26,970
Oh.

962
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,350
Good try.

963
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:28,690
Good try.

964
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:30,570
I got your kills though, you guys.

965
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:31,510
Okay.

966
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,410
They were so close.

967
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,050
They were like, there was one on our level.

968
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,470
Probably because they heard us fucking stomping across the
map.

969
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,110
No, they're stream stomping.

970
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:48,110
Okay, we literally were we just like put you with gunfire
down.

971
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:53,870
I'm pretty sure someone shot me in the fucking back because
there's no way that guy killed me in that patch.

972
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:54,670
That was me.

973
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:56,390
I got a little silly.

974
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,690
Oh, geez.

975
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,510
We should have took him the long row.

976
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,590
Oh, fuck, I didn't realize we were defending.

977
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,050
Okay, wait, who's defending B?

978
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,570
Who's gonna work on him?

979
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,350
I'm just gonna put on.

980
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:08,830
I'll do B.

981
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,210
I'll do B.

982
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:09,510
I'll do B.

983
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:13,910
This here.

984
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,610
Do that here.

985
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,750
I'm going to throw this here.

986
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,030
I'm putting my razor wire here.

987
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:21,570
That cover.

988
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,430
Remember, don't forget about your barricades.

989
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:26,390
No, I can already tell Gomez is a huge brain.

990
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,010
What did I do?

991
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,510
You have a huge brain.

992
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,190
You just put all that stuff in really good spots.

993
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,190
Dude, I woke up really good today.

994
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:36,190
I'm ready.

995
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:37,350
Motion.

996
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,410
Foam deployed.

997
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:40,770
Ready more than I could be.

998
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,350
Then I'm going to put...

999
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:44,590
Wait.

1000
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:45,750
We're going A.

1001
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,110
Wait, that's where I am.

1002
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:48,890
That's where I am.

1003
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:51,210
I'm gonna put a wall like this.

1004
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,690
I basically set up...

1005
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:54,090
Using the music for cover.

1006
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,650
So that means they have to use the guy with the hammer,
because I took the other guy.

1007
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,790
So they can't blow the walls over.

1008
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,530
So we can shoot him while he's doing it.

1009
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,250
Oh, motion, motion, motion here.

1010
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:03,870
Motion, motion, motion.

1011
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,210
They got motion.

1012
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,490
I have a wall there.

1013
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:10,910
It's fine.

1014
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:12,650
They're taking it super slow.

1015
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:14,650
Me when I remembered I could barricade.

1016
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:20,490
things oh they broke through oh they're trying to kill me
hold on hold give me give me a vision give me vision all the

1017
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:27,350
way waiting i give vision yep are they going around oh
they're going around there's two coming on me right now yeah

1018
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:35,830
you're by yourself bad you're careful that's okay right here
right here i see him watch out for the grenade right here

1019
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:45,370
got one nice watch behind us wait behind us behind us behind
us behind us oh she got me she beat me I was trying to

1020
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:55,010
reload They walked through the gas For some reason Oh my god
What I didn't see them Round fired

1021
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:06,960
Are you behind you behind you Come on you Come to you
Shefford What you didn't kill him No He didn't kill him I

1022
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:14,460
saw like going That was like an awkward run around I saw it
He like perfectly Perfectly Ringed around me Yeah I'm so sad

1023
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:20,340
The wall I was trying to fling through Was reinforced And I
was like Well I can't blow it up They'll hear me I'm so sad.

1024
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,440
Oh no, it's close now.

1025
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,520
No, Shrevear, I shit you not.

1026
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,560
He like perfectly LOS'd me the entire way.

1027
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,040
That was trying to peek him.

1028
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:27,840
That's sad.

1029
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,740
I got pinched.

1030
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:35,040
I mean, I didn't see, I didn't realize that he got an angle
on that area too.

1031
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:37,860
Also I have an idea.

1032
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,860
Now that you're holding that spot, Shrevear, I have an idea.

1033
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,360
What if I, what if I wall off the other off angle so then
you can just perm a fart on him?

1034
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,580
I can only have two farts.

1035
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,460
No, but like this here.

1036
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,060
So like if he wants the peek over here, they have to break
this door and then they have to also break it.

1037
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:57,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,960
And Lord has you can...

1039
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,620
Yeah, this is the good.

1040
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,000
This is good.

1041
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,400
And then we wall off this.

1042
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,160
So then you have like a perfect far angle.

1043
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,820
It's actually perfect.

1044
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:06,940
All right.

1045
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,300
It came from here.

1046
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,840
So I'm putting a motion here.

1047
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,180
And then I'll put a motion here.

1048
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,040
I'm going to fence up this.

1049
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,980
We're a bit split up here.

1050
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,020
Oh, I think they're walking by me.

1051
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:32,960
By yourself.

1052
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,280
They're all there on him, on him.

1053
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,300
There's no flight ground here.

1054
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,960
Oh, I can make one.

1055
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,780
Foam deployed.

1056
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,470
Don't hear any.

1057
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:52,930
Oh, they've got names on me.

1058
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,270
Watch behind us.

1059
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:58,230
Okay.

1060
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,030
They're close.

1061
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,790
They crossed?

1062
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:02,150
Oh, they're here!

1063
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:02,930
Oh, they're here!

1064
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,490
I didn't...

1065
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:04,970
Right here.

1066
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:05,610
Where I ping?

1067
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:06,950
I'm ready for it.

1068
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,030
Oh, you saw me.

1069
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:09,650
You got him?

1070
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:10,190
Go on, go on.

1071
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,030
I got him.

1072
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:12,670
That's here.

1073
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:13,150
Oh, two more over there.

1074
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:14,690
Wait, wait, wait.

1075
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,990
Three?

1076
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,430
I remember you could jump in this.

1077
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:18,410
I jumped over the...

1078
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:19,010
Last one here.

1079
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:19,230
Last one here.

1080
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:19,650
Two more.

1081
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:20,010
Two more.

1082
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:20,570
One more.

1083
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,510
Yeah, right here.

1084
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,390
I think you asked your place, though.

1085
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:24,910
He asked the place.

1086
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:26,010
Yeah, so he's at the way from the place.

1087
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:28,430
Yeah, I'll try to walk away from you.

1088
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:45,400
one sure for that makes noise by the way yeah that still
makes noise but again just keep making noise and scared him

1089
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,280
because then he has to come look for the noise you know the
badger shoots another egg wait badger that he's gonna be

1090
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:57,060
like maybe walking through a or and he probably will you

Watch out.

1104
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,080
Gas round fired.

1105
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,340
Want a wallet?

1106
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,640
I gassed it.

1107
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:44,760
You're over here.

1108
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:45,860
They're hitting this wall too.

1109
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,460
Just be patient.

1110
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,400
Yeah, I'm making sure we don't get fined.

1111
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,060
Oh, they scanned me.

1112
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,040
I got detected.

1113
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:56,820
I have an idea.

1114
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,020
Oh my god, Badger.

1115
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,800
That's an insane kill.

1116
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,100
That's their entry.

1117
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:00,760
Their entry is dead.

1118
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:02,820
Watch out, Badger.

1119
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:03,480
Don't do it.

1120
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,300
How does he know who his entry is?

1121
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,920
It's a shield guy.

1122
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,260
Oh, I hear someone walking far left.

1123
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,380
Yeah, you tried, bitch.

1124
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:12,760
By you.

1125
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,420
By you.

1126
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,140
I hear someone wrong.

1127
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:16,860
Easy kill.

1128
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:17,460
I'm either down.

1129
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,020
There you go.

1130
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,620
Oh my god.

1131
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:20,080
Oh.

1132
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,280
Go come get me.

1133
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,200
Oh, he's one there.

1134
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:24,820
He's one there.

1135
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,560
Uh, they're, they're in between A and B.

1136
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:26,920
Yep.

1137
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,320
Yep.

1138
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,160
Gomez sees where they are.

1139
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:31,900
He's in the corner.

1140
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:33,760
Yeah, he is.

1141
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:34,940
Watch behind us.

1142
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:35,620
Oh.

1143
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:36,960
He's going outside.

1144
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,680
Oh, he's walking.

1145
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,720
My, my sense is here.

1146
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:39,060
I'm here.

1147
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,740
Outside that wall, the sticky wall.

1148
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,380
One enemy.

1149
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,480
The last one's really low.

1150
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:46,300
The last one's really low.

1151
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,540
I'm so mad.

1152
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:50,640
I'm so mad.

1153
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,440
Do some characters have more health?

1154
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,080
Triple top armor than other.

1155
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:54,940
I have no idea.

1156
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,220
I think it's just the guns, right?

1157
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,800
Maybe the guns just do more damage.

1158
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,220
How's the vector loose to a freaking AK?

1159
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,360
He hit his shots.

1160
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,980
I feel like your gun is- How do you know Gomez did that with
156 ping?

1161
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,020
I don't know.

1162
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,680
Yeah, well, you're looking at 31.6% accuracy.

1163
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,160
Acquacy?

1164
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:14,540
Okay.

1165
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,420
Oh, accuracy?

1166
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,900
I was not familiar with your game.

1167
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,700
No, no, princess.

1168
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,240

Oh, yeah.

1170
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,800
There has to be different armor values.

1171
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:28,500
Oh, yeah.

1172
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,140
So this is the sure forest line.

1173
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,140
I forgot to read it out for everybody.

1174
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:32,980
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1175
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:38,500
My sword glistens in the night as that moonlight shines on
the edge of my blade.

1176

this distance just positioning the last beat of your heart

1181
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:33,520
one last cherry blossom falls from the tree on your chest

That's a four word limit.

1184
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:39,840
I don't want to say anything.

1185
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,140
Was that chat GPT?

1186
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,660
Yeah, I was told four word limit.

1187
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,100
That was the chat GPT.

1188
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,140
No, I don't use AI.

1189
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,520
That's all him.

1190
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:48,440
All right.

1191
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,420
So Heavenly, wait, did Heavenly tell you guys what he wrote?

1192
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,420
Please just go ahead and tell them.

1193
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,000
It's like eating something.

1194
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,900
No, no.

1195
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:01,380
No, the chicken thing I made up, that was just gaslighting.

1196
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,100
That's not real.

1197
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,200
This was...

1198
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,400
Hey, uh, Doki Bird, ready up.

1199
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:05,900
All right.

1200
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,240
Here we go.

1201
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:16,640
step aside princess a real alpha is here i think i was
hoping i would be horrible because now i'm like 30 kills

1202
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:30,200
with that imagine that you get kill leader need to display
that there's like our kill leader is heavenly oh hello oh

1203
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:42,500
sorry guys uh are you guys ready for set two yep yes we are
okay thank you all right we're ready we're ready we got the

1204
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:51,500
plan this can potentially be last game guys is it best of
three yeah and then we go to the finals yes then we win yeah

1205
01:13:51,500 --> 01:14:00,000
we win we get more money by the way i didn't notice how op
the guy with the shield's gun is that fire so that's why

1206
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:08,780
that's why people kept running that guy my vector doesn't
seem to fire fast at all What is up with you and this gun?

1207
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:09,920
I don't know.

1208
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,700
You should have saw what happened when I was lasering that
guy and I lost him an AK and pissing me off.

1209
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,740
Maybe you should play the AK guy.

1210
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,920
Well, my gun has 20 bullets as well.

1211
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:21,780
So what's your excuse?

1212
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,120
My excuse is they have to have different armor values or
something.

1213
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,060
I think that's coke.

1214
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,200
I'm pretty sure that's coke.

1215
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:33,040
Man.

1216
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,360
Oh, wait.

1217
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,680
Wait, this is a perfect push.

1218
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,200
Why don't we go outskirts into into here?

1219
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:41,980
Okay.

1220
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,640
And break the, oh, wait, no, wait, that's a big wall.

1221
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:44,800
We don't have a breacher.

1222
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,060
I guess what?

1223
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,580
Wait, no, you are a breacher.

1224
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:48,220
Aren't you?

1225
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:48,860
No, I know you're not.

1226
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,000
I was gas, but no, I can breach.

1227
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,200
No, no, no, no, no.

1228
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:51,480
On.

1229
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,900
What if we just go through?

1230
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,560
We don't really need the juice.

1231
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:55,480
The juice isn't really helping.

1232
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,380
We can just go through the control room pre-treatment and
then in.

1233
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,080
I can breach.

1234
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,200
I can go the breacher.

1235
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,200
All right.

1236
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:02,660
Okay, fine.

1237
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,400
Yeah, we go there.

1238
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:03,820
We go there.

1239
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,420
All right.

1240
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:04,900
Are we breaching?

1241
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:06,580
So I'm on the other side of the map.

1242
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,860
It changed my spawn.

1243
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:10,640
That's kind of epic.

1244
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:11,640
Everyone, let's just wait.

1245
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,080
Let's just wait.

1246
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:12,820
Make them anticipate.

1247
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:13,620
Okay, okay.

1248
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,220
True, true, true.

1249
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:14,800
I love team.

1250
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,340
Wait, wait.

1251
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,320
Someone grab the bomb.

1252
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:16,860
Not me.

1253
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,840
Wait, they're just shooting shit.

1254
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,360
They're breaking doors.

1255
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,040
Just hopping.

1256
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,740
I think they hear us.

1257
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:25,440
All right.

1258
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,080
We're going right here, right?

1259
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,280
All right.

1260
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,320
I'm throwing my motion.

1261
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:28,900
Okay.

1262
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:29,760
Shoot it up in first.

1263
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:30,580
All right.

1264
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:30,900
Break it.

1265
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:31,620
Okay.

1266
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,540
Break this wall.

1267
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:34,620
Oh, wait.

1268
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,880
There's nothing to throw it and then hit E.

1269
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,580
That is a lot.

1270
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,400
It may not.

1271
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:41,680
Let me reload this.

1272
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,020
Okay.

1273
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:42,740
I thought I was ready.

1274
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,080
I forgot.

1275
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:43,520
Hold on.

1276
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,520
Three, two, one.

1277
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:44,980
Go, go, go.

1278
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:48,360
Break through it.

1279
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:48,640
Break through it.

1280
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:49,520
I can't reach it.

1281
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,320
Oh, you got gas.

1282
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:53,220
You got gas.

1283
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,000
It's preaching.

1284
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,440
Someone looking back.

1285
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:55,960
Hold on.

1286
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,880
Someone look behind.

1287
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:57,440
It's just in case.

1288
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,080
Get the heroin shot.

1289
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,260
Get the heroin shot.

1290
01:15:59,520 --> 01:15:59,660
Ready?

1291
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,220
Three, two, one.

1292
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,180
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1293
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,300
Okay.

1294
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,360
Gas, gas.

1295
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,540
shot the gas and it put it on my shield.

1296
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:10,460
I did not know that was possible.

1297
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,440
Now you know.

1298
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,260
That's kind of funny.

1299
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:13,600
Huge.

1300
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,600
I'm super low though.

1301
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,300
Huge.

1302
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,040
Oh my god.

1303
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:18,420
Three.

1304
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,240
Oh, I got you.

1305
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,400
I was super low.

1306
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:21,840
I have one HP.

1307
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:23,280
You got this.

1308
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:24,360
No.

1309
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:26,800
One was crouched.

1310
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,940
One was standing up.

1311
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,480
No, we need to do that.

1312
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,420
I kind of forgot about the gas thing, man.

1313
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,340
No, no, no, no.

1314
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:35,860
A very big FYI here is...

1315
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:36,800
Yeah, it can put...

1316
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:43,200
that you can none of us can engage but the front person or
else we're friendly firing each other yeah i'm pretty sure

1317
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:50,180
someone fucked me up no every time every time i want you to
shoot i'm usually crouching so that's that's usually well

1318
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:57,920
it's more so the people behind the person behind you are
shooting one more time then i'm going back to my character

1319
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,180
and we're just going to split up and do the crazy stuff we
normally do okay okay well i didn't i didn't know where to

1320
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:08,820
break that wall i'm not gonna lie that breach charge takes
way too long that's too long we yeah we should use the

1321
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:17,140
hammer guys then use a portable i think this guy is a sticky
launcher no that doesn't break walls you got to use the the

1322
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:24,440
dude with the ak the the goggles yeah yeah goggles that guy
but just be careful one guy's not with us right now one

1323
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:30,400

yes also well no but also don't stand near him when he does

1324
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,000
it does do a A lot of damage.

1325
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,260
Wait, we just busted his window.

1326
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,360
Wait, let's just busted his window.

1327
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,460
Okay, holding up my shield.

1328
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,500
Oh, very far, very far.

1329
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:42,680
Walking.

1330
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,380
Checking inside.

1331
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,780
They used the impact.

1332
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,360
Checking corners.

1333
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,160
Nothing here.

1334
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,520
They're trying to wall bang on front point.

1335
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,400
Right here.

1336
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:52,860
Close.

1337
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:54,740
Shield ready.

1338
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,380
Okay, fire.

1339
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,040
Oh, I took it.

1340
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,640
I took it.

1341
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,240
My bad, my bad.

1342
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,220
Okay, Doki is alone, by the way.

1343
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:04,860
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1344
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:05,280
That's fine.

1345
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,200
They're right here, right here.

1346
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,360
Watch out.

1347
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:07,960
I have a motion.

1348
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,160
I'm checking right.

1349
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,020
They're close, close, close.

1350
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,200
Lord, head out.

1351
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:13,540
Watch out.

They forwarded.

1353
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:16,520
They forwarded.

1354
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,660
Okay, it's fine.

1355
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,060
Do you have another, do you have another breach?

1356
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,660
Hold on.

1357
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,960
I can engage from there.

1358
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:26,940
I can engage from here.

1359
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:27,520
Okay.

01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:28,600

Yeah, walked in to be free.

01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,070
Well, like, show us how your entire team went to the fight
in that fucking vent.

01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:33,210
Yeah, do that again.

1384
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,110
We could just do that again.

1387
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:57,460

They're here.

01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,420
I'm gonna, I'm gonna want someone to smoke this side.

1392
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:13,960
On the left.

1393
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,720
I feel like emergency room spawn is ass because you can't do
anything in this entire hallway.

1394
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,620
Like this entire wall is just dead.

1395
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,160
Yeah, let's go askers then.

1396
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:23,540
Yeah.

1397
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,700
I need you guys to make noise.

1398
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,620
Make some noise.

1399
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,040
Cause I have the bomb.

1400
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,340
If I die with the bomb, that'd be very awkward.

1401
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,800
I'll just, I'm gonna wait until you guys come out.

1402
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,320
I'm in.

1403
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,500
Are you in?

1404
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:40,880
Are you in?

1405
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,020
No, I wouldn't hit you.

1406
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:42,920
I'm a good shot.

1407
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,120
We're checking every corner.

1408
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,180
When you walk in.

1409
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:46,660
All right.

1410
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:47,040
Walking.

1411
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:48,840
Walking here.

1412
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,140
Wait, you should probably check the inside here.

1413
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:53,640
There you go.

1414
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:54,120
Okay.

1415
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,560
Walking here.

1416
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,040
Walking here.

1417
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:57,560
If you want.

1418
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:58,360
Here.

1419
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,180
Walking here.

1420
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,080
Back up.

1421
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:00,320
Back up.

1422
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,740
I'm going to blow the walls open.

1423
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:02,640
Yep.

1424
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:03,680
Grenade.

1425
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,470
I'm going to shoot that.

1426
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:08,690
Oh, my grenade blew up.

1427
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:09,150

1430
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:18,730
I'm reloading.

1431
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:19,850
I'm getting out of the way He downed me.

1432
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:20,770
I downed him.

1433
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,570
Okay Let's crouch.

1434
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:29,330

1436
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:32,590
He's crashed.

1437
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:41,630
He has my bomb Okay, he's all you have to do is tickle him
He has a bomb, so he's got a guard for it.

1438
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:44,970
One.

1439
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:45,870
You're kicked out of scans.

1440
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,630
Yeah, but the problem is...

1441
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:50,510
I don't know where he is.

1442
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:52,230
Maybe in this room?

1443
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:53,130
In there on your right?

1444
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,450
How many scans do you have?

1445
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:57,130
One.

1446
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:00,970
I was mostly...

1447
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,550
Just walk through, be a big boss about it.

1448
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:04,530
Don't even scare it, bro.

1449
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,450
If you clear left the left room, can't you just...

1450
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,550
The thing is, that slows him down, so...

1451
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,630
There's only a vent in there.

1452
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:15,610
Well...

1453
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,310
Just walk through the barbed wire.

1454
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:16,730
Let him know.

1455
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:17,090
It doesn't hurt.

1456
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:17,670
Just makes noise.

1457
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:19,630
Let him know you were there and you're ready to kill.

1458
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:21,190
Yeah!

1459
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,910
Oh, he...

1460
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:24,670
You dropped him.

1461
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:26,690
Oh, he's running away.

1462
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:27,570
Do you go on B?

1463
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:28,590
He went on B.

1464
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,530
Yeah, he's in B.

1465
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,670
He's just gonna... Oh, nice!

1466
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:32,010
Oh, he has no...

1467
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:32,250
He has no...

1468
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,530
Just make noise and let him know you're ready to kill.

1469
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:37,850
That's the strat.

1470
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:43,330
So can you explain when somebody's crouching, you have to
hit control or you can shoot?

1471
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:45,470
Or you crouch as well.

1472
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:46,190
Or you crouch as well.

1473
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:48,410
If you crouch, then you can just shooting at him.

1474
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:48,970
Okay.

1475
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,750
If you crouch, then they're already shooting.

1476
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,150
If you're still standing though.

1477
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:52,890
Yeah.

1478
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,190
Right?

1479
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:54,230
You do.

1480
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,230
You just hit him on the crouch.

1481
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,190
You want me to grab the bomb again and do the same thing or?

1482
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:00,190
We're defending.

1483
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:01,090
Oh, we're defending.

1484
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:01,770
Oh, whoops.

1485
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,170
I didn't even notice.

1486
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,510
All right.

1487
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,250
Why my characters look indifferent?

1488
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:07,810
It's weird.

1489
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:08,910
Boom and coming.

1490
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:09,610
We're the best.

1491
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,070
Where the frick is I?

1492
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:13,410
Where the frick is I?

1493
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,890
I can't wall this.

1494
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:17,490
Razor wires down.

1495
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:19,930
I put razor wire here.

1496
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:24,710
Can my walls be put on on on surfaces that are not the
floor?

1497
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:26,730
Or no?

1498
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:27,750
You don't know.

1499
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,450
Or is it just bounce?

1500
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,850
I don't want to test it.

1501
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,670
Put this here.

1502
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,010
I don't even know where to.

1503
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,550
I guess like here.

01:23:40,450 --> 01:24:02,530

Oh, they're breaching.

1507
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,190
Oh, they know we're here.

1508
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,910
They know we're here.

1509
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:19,390
Yeah, I'm detected.

1510
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:22,410
I gasped.

1511
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:25,270
Okay, I got gasped again.

1512
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:28,350
Wait, no, that was a, oh, that was a, that was a scan.

1513
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:28,930
That's a scan.

01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:29,730
Yeah.

1515
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,130
They're throwing him here.

1516
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:31,330
I was hitting someone.

1517
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:31,870
I'm dead.

1518
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:32,990
Oh, no, no.

You rose me.

1521
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,430
I gasped again.

1522
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:36,530
Sure, sure.

1523
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:36,690
Sure.

1524
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:40,090
I'm holding the angle.

1525
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:41,550

1526
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:42,230

Okay, that's cool.

1530
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:48,270

1532
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,830

1535
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:52,970
Oh, there's one more.

1536
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,270
To your left, to your left.

01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,010
He was crouching.

1541
01:25:00,030 --> 01:25:00,170
He was crouching.

1542
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:01,990
I swear, that's the reason that I missed him too.

1543
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:03,510
He was one.

1544
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:07,250
I feel like you got to be crouched all the time because
people forget to hit control.

1545
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,150
I'm holding it.

1546

01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:23,020
Okay.

1655
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:23,960
He's about down.

1656
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:24,660
Just wait.

1657
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,100
Just wait.

01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,000
Just wait.

1659
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,040
It's also the dicey guy.

1660
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:29,640
He loves the crouch.

1661
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,080
Remember that.

1662
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:30,760
Wait in the corner.

1663
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,000
So dicey's dead.

1664
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,100
Shot by his own teammate.

1665
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:35,280
He's won.

1666
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:35,700
You don't have to do it.

1667
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:36,560
Let's put a plant.

1668
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,000
Let's put a plant.

1669
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:37,700
Let's put a plant.

1670
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:37,980
Let's put a plant.

1671
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:38,800
It's they time.

1672
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:39,460
Oh, they don't have it.

1673
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:39,540
Yeah.

1674
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:42,620
He's one.

1675
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:43,460
He should kill him.

1676
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,360
I think he's invincible.

1677
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,080
Hold on.

1678
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:46,800
Lord, head out.

1679
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,060
That's the motherfucker.

1680
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,660
I'm trying to play for our win.

1681
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:52,940
Guys, if we win this, we get, we gotta win this, guys.

1682
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:53,820
Last point.

1683
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:54,380
Last point.

1684
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,800
This map is hard to attack.

1685
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,240
No, it's not.

1686
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:57,780
No, it's not.

1687
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,440
I don't think Wilson was working.

1688
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,720
I don't know if Wilson was working for us, though.

1689
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:03,840
Just make noise.

1690
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,660
Don't keep sneaking in big flanky.

1691
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:15,560
do this okay do a little bit of we don't got the pink-haired
cat girl do you want me to get bomb again or no you want me

1692
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:22,440
to try the bomb okay honestly it seems easier to attack if
we're like going through be like yeah i think we actually

1693
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:27,440
have to take the long way that's fine i'll just make more
noise from prep i'll just i was like doing this i don't know

1694
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:33,800
i really like prep i mean like prep or back entrance or
pre-treatment room come make noise and meet in yeah we can

1695
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:39,700
just i have the bomb so that you guys i'm just gonna wait
for you guys to make noise what if i just pocket sure for

1696
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:49,020
every every swing but like i could just do that that'd just
be op as fuck right i don't even have to peek i don't know i

1697
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:57,760
think it might just might be low op i can think we're going
that way always keep them guessing let me know when you're

1698
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:03,920

wait oh choose defense do you want defense or whatever you

1718
01:34:54,350 --> 01:35:00,310

choose the map no no we get to choose map or side so do you

1719
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:05,690
want map or side oh dude i'd rather pick the map these guys

1720
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:16,590
hub then all right third hub so is team jokey going for

1721
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:23,590
whatever map we did for the first round whatever that no
that was b yeah so you're saying we're doing the third hub a

1722
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:29,990
now no we're doing third hub b no that's the map we did on
the first round so we should do that one shouldn't we since

1723
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:35,170
we know that that's the map can we redo maps can we redo
maps yes you can Oh, then yeah, there's a B.

1724
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:37,550
Alright.

1725
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,250
Oh, my God.

1726
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:42,310
Guys, I think Dicey's coming, catching up to kill leader.

1727
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:43,770
He had 15 kills.

1728
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,850
That don't mean nothing for nobody, bro.

1729
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:49,750
That don't mean nothing for nobody, bro.

1730
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:53,430
We just gotta crouch, guys.

1731
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:54,690
That's all we gotta do.

1732
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:57,130
We just gotta keep crouching.

1733
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:02,010
But every time I crouch, they shoot me.

1734
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:11,310
so how does that work crow try dude i'm gonna get water
problem with crouching is if they do the aim down strat

1735
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:20,030
you're only getting headshot which means you die fast not
really well yeah center mass yeah but like wait i'm trying

1736
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:28,570
to be a smart fella not a fart smell here does the
sledgehammer work on reinforced walls yes yeah it just takes

1737
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:40,570
two hammers oh yeah it's gonna op you don't have to use the
don't you are exposing defense oh they have to choose

1738
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:48,330
they're gonna choose defense because it has a higher win
rate yeah these nerds are always picking the same map don't

1739
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:54,790
we pick this map no we pick the map no but for some reason
all three teams all three teams that we played against they

1740
01:36:54,790 --> 01:37:01,090
all picked hospital apparently it's the best map i don't
know there's so many i don't know why it's just really easy

1741
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:08,530
to defend maybe for them it's because it is the main problem
with that map is there's that one giant ass wall that has

1742
01:37:08,530 --> 01:37:17,250
literally zero entries towards it so you have an entire
inbuilt defense so it's like heavily defense sided yeah

1743
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:25,430
that's why they want us on attack every time i mean it is
harder because you have to do something and they just have

1744
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:25,970
to not do

1745
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:31,170
They're asking you ready.

1746
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:31,830

1762
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,070
All right, we'll run it back then.

1763
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:36,850
Yeah, the Wilson's trap for this map is insane.

1764
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:39,230
All right, who we go?

1765
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:45,230
So we're doing this and then we just go.

1766
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,930
That's pretty gas, all right.

1767
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:49,410
That's a pretty easy entry.

1768
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:52,370
You could actually do east entry hallway.

1769
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,070
This is what we're going to do.

1770
01:38:54,170 --> 01:38:56,890
I'm going to smoke the right side like right here.

1771
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:57,430
Oh, wait.

1772
01:38:57,670 --> 01:38:58,110

Uh, is this a door or is this a window?

1776
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:06,530
That's a door.

1777
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:07,510
A window?

1778
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:08,210
I don't know.

1779
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:09,330
We walked in, remember?

1780
01:39:09,470 --> 01:39:10,290
We walked in from here.

1781
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:10,770
I remember.

1782
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:13,170
Okay, we just do the same thing then.

1783
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:14,610
I got scan.

1784
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:17,170
I can motion too.

1785
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:18,890
I'll throw it.

1786
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,370
Oh.

1787
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:20,910
I got motion.

1788
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,190
Wait, no one.

1789
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:25,550
I almost told y'all with a grenade.

1790
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:26,650
I pulled out the wrong thing.

1791
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:27,430
Oh, that's going.

1792
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:28,810
Checking corner.

1793
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:29,790
I'll just bust it.

1794
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,910
I'll just bust it out of the way.

1795
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:32,690
Oh, I got one.

1796
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:33,210
Busted, busted, busted.

1797
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:34,430
There you go.

1798
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:35,210
Two of his eyes.

1799
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:38,650
He didn't get him.

1800
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:39,310
Chucking every corner.

1801
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,190
You're gassed.

1802
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:40,650
You're gassed.

1803
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:43,810
Oh, you ran into me with the gas, man!

1804
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,990
I'm trying to run away from you, bro!

1805
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:47,810
You're running towards me!

1806
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:50,350
What the fuck happened?

1807
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:51,930
That's fucking tragic, dude.

1808
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:52,770
That's shocking.

1809
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,610
What happened?

1810
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:58,910
So, Lord Headass got hit by the gas grenade direct, so it's
stuck to him.

1811
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:01,750
I'm trying to run away from him as he's falling.

1812
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:06,770
pulling me into a hallway where I get fucking railed.

1813
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:10,110
That's so awkward.

1814
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,650
Say come give me a hug before I die, dude.

1815
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:17,650
Also, I just realized, if so, okay, I feel like I wanna play
Patch and Set for this.

1816
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:17,870
Okay.

1817
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,010
Because I can just wall the left side.

1818
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:21,550
And they can't flink us.

1819
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,350
I'm letting Jesus take the wheel.

1820
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,350
All these NFs out here.

1821
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:25,970
I'm like, yeah, dude, let's attack.

1822
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,010
Yeah, dude.

1823
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:28,490
My bad, my bad.

1824
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:30,170
I was definitely playing for the vibes on that one.

1825
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:32,770
But I was like, dude, if I'm gonna die, I'm not dying alone.

1826
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:38,150
No, not the walk of shame.

1827
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:45,570
You guys can check out, but I cannot have to stay here until
the end.

1828
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,690
I'm staying as far away from now.

1829
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:50,890
I'm likely it's better for me to leave as soon as possible,
technically.

1830
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:52,890
We keep going.

1831
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:54,730
Yeah, but you get 1K.

1832
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:58,170
Yeah, but this guy got 15 kills last game.

1833
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:01,750
Yeah, and we can stop him here and you can build.

1834
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:16,210
up more kills motion detector plates oh they're like right
here okay oh he won't be won me he's very low but yeah

1835
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:24,390
there's a guy in that hallway oh wait i bomb i can't okay
that was him but you're so low though that's fine i'm gonna

1836
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:27,590
wall this though i'm gonna double i don't i'm not alive

1837
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:34,230
Wait, how do we go away then?

1838
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,890
Wait, can we...

1839
01:41:37,650 --> 01:41:37,990
Huh?

1840
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,230
Shoot through this?

1841
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:41,810
You can, but it's bulletproof.

1842
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:42,670
You gotta go around.

1843
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:46,910
I got...

1844
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:47,310
Oh, he's in the corner.

1845
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:47,910
He's in the corner.

1846
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:48,970
Doki, I'm 1 HP.

1847
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:49,730

other one my bad no no i i went to plan because they were

1866
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:13,710
like you can plow i was like i can okay i'll stay alive for
longer than five seconds so we can hard breach it's okay so

1867
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:21,050
i was trying to i was trying to do the the foam wall instead
but then i smoked twice which i didn't mean to do oh

1868
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:29,910
actually i can use a breach hook why don't you just use that
well how does this work has anyone even used this before i

1869
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:37,270
have no idea the breach does it work like as a single hard
breach maybe also wait hold on sure fork can you can you

1870
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:40,190
scan right there with your thingy Yeah.

1871
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:42,690
So then, so then we know if anyone's in that room.

1872

Okay.

1873
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,810
Cause I think it covers the whole area, right?

1874
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:54,270
Uh, I don't, I don't think it goes the whole way, but we'll
find out.

1875
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:55,430
It's fine.

1876
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:56,410

01:43:58,110 --> 01:43:59,190
Like five, four points.

1893
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:56,260
you can't down though you just run in dokey you can't see i
don't know just stay there just stay there so you can revive

Let's go, a team kill.

1900
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:46,540
Oh, by the way, the barbed wire is OP as fuck.

1901
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:50,900
I didn't know when you're walking through it, your accuracy
is like non-existent.

1902
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:52,200
Your bullets just spread around.

1903
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:56,040
So that's how I killed Heavenly yesterday on accident.

1904
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,980
That explains so much.

1905
01:45:58,620 --> 01:45:59,540
Also, someone break this.

1906
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:00,860
We need this broken.

1907
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,820
I'm reinforcing all of this.

1908
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:06,600
That explains so much.

1909
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,140
Why is that a mechanic?

1910
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:08,700
Okay.

1911
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,400
You want me to reinforce these two?

1912
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:25,020
enemies here watch out any wire yeah what the fuck uh just
right here let's angle it boom foam deployed motion detector

1913
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:31,480

Wait, they don't know about the tripwire.

1964
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:55,150
They can just jump through that.

1965
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:55,530

01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:26,130
I know, but I don't know what I can do here.

1983
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:26,550
You've probably got an angle.

1984
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:27,710
Well, you can hold them.

1985
01:50:30,870 --> 01:50:31,730
They motioned me.

1986
01:50:32,810 --> 01:50:33,490
They know I'm here.

1987
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:35,970
Good shot.

1988
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:37,110
One.

It's a 1v1.

1990
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:38,690
You got lots of bullets.

1991
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,190
You have a hundred bullets.

1992
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:40,330

2061
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:28,350
play slow there because i knew he had a shotgun and i didn't
want to run at him i was like i that actually like oh my god

2062
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:29,650
that Fuck me up.

2063
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,970
And I saw someone.

2064
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:32,450
You fumbled.

2065
01:56:32,650 --> 01:56:34,350
I was like, what do you mean I fumbled?

2066
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:36,710
They told me to run into a shotgun.

2067
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:39,470
Like, what was I?

2068
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:42,570
They told me to run straight into a shotgun bullet.

2069
01:56:50,210 --> 01:56:53,630
I know I had a shotgun, but he told me to run at him.

2070
01:56:56,810 --> 01:56:57,290
Yeah.

2071
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:58,550
But I had less HP.

2072
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:05,290
because I got shot though that's the thing he would window
shotgun fight no matter what because I had I already got hit

2073
01:57:05,290 --> 01:57:13,850
I already got hit didn't matter he just need to pump me with
a shotgun one time like he I need pump twice he needs to

2074
01:57:13,850 --> 01:57:16,970
pump once so that's why I wanted to play slow

2075
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:34,970
yeah oh man yeah close up shot yeah so like it was he need
one pump I need a two pump That's why that like that like

2076
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:40,430
got to me there because I thought I think I could have I
could have like clutched that there just that one fight I

2077
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:47,010
definitely felt like I clutched it and I felt really I was
like oh my god but it didn't matter it was a four two anyway

2078
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:58,050
yeah it was just in hindsight but the team was like the team
was fun it was fun the vibes were great I had a really

2079
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:03,350
I had a great time.

2080
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:11,610
I really appreciate everybody for coming and showing up
because they showed up here for free, technically.

2081
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:15,150
You know, gave up their time to play for free.

2082
01:58:17,570 --> 01:58:21,750
And, oh my God, I got knocked out of my own tournament.

2083
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:26,650
The walk of shame.

2084
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:31,070
I was like, oh, can I end stream?

2085
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:34,770
After I get knocked out, they're like, no, you gotta stay to
the very end because it is your turn.

2086
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:36,510
And I was like, that is true.

2087
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:41,590
But not last.

2088
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:42,910
But not last.

2089
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:48,070
It's like, I was like, yeah, it's you like, it's your turn,
but you should stay.

2090
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:49,970
I was like, that, that is true.

2091
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:51,030
I should stay.

2092
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:59,090
Like, the stream of shame.

2093
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:12,590
um yeah fandom from the next term any any team that knocks
me out they're not allowed to play in my next tournament

2094
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:24,810
that those privileges for yeah i was like no don't make me
still continue to go live after i lost no

2095
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:32,590
Um, I'm not gonna watch Twitch.

2096
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:34,250
I'll just watch the Observer.

2097
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:36,250
I'll just join in the Observer channel.

2098
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:37,610
Where is it?

2099
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,910
Uh, it's best of three.

2100
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:42,990
So, like, it should be pretty fast, right?

2101
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:44,650
It's best of three.

2102
01:59:47,730 --> 01:59:50,230
I think, like, the match- It's so fast.

2103
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:52,530
It's so fast that, like, messes with me.

2104
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:54,070
Yeah, I'll just join the Observer.

2105
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:55,710
I feel like that's the easiest.

2106
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:58,550
I have access to the channel to join the Observer.

2107
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:19,140
yeah it's a super fast game i think on mobile this game will
do really really well in general i'm pretty sure this game

2108
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:27,680
is like if they release a mobile version this game is like
built for mobile too because especially because it's top

2109
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:34,200
down now i'm like i'm literally slouched up right now

Why are they using the in-game voice comms?

2165
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:06,970
Yeah.

2166
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:12,950
They're listening to their in- No, it's here.

2167
02:05:13,090 --> 02:05:17,050
They're listening to their In-game VC Right now.

2168
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:20,410
I was so confused.

2169
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:31,370
Bum.

2170
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:36,110
Bum, bum, bum.

2171
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:46,500
I don't know.

2172
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:09,660
He lost Kill Leader?

2173
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:10,220
Yeah.

2174
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:12,680
I mean, he was gonna lose Kill Leader eventually.

2175
02:06:12,860 --> 02:06:15,320
We don't make it to the finals

2176
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:38,110
what the fuck brother good luck why is he oh is he open mic
oh my god he is he's open mic right now he's open mic at the

2177
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:47,430
moment oh no mvp unfortunately the casters wanted to do um
and left click to shoot this time right all right the caster

2178
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:51,650
wanted to do only to the winning team, which makes sense.

2179
02:06:51,830 --> 02:06:57,370
You know, it makes sense because they won, so they have to
have an MVP in the tournament, you know?

2180
02:06:57,690 --> 02:06:59,010
It makes sense.

2181
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:01,670
Oh, can the other team hear him?

2182
02:07:01,810 --> 02:07:02,770
I guess they can.

2183
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:04,190
Yeah.

2184
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:11,350
So the vote would just be, like, whoever is on the winning
team, which I assume is Muda's team because they've just

2185
02:07:11,350 --> 02:07:13,150
been steamrolling everyone.

2186
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:31,720
But I don't know anyone on this team.

2187
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:43,360
think needs the money the most i think that's the i think
that's the easiest because it's 2k

2188
02:07:56,740 --> 02:08:06,020
just don't vote for the captains vote for the players that
volunteered their time and just don't vote for the sponsored

2189
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:15,140
captains just vote for anyone but the sponsored captains
because the rest of the players gave up their times to be uh

2190
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:29,560
um to be uh to be in this tournament all right how do i do
this i want to swap oh okay all right let's see whoa wait

2191
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:35,940
how do i like i don't even get to i want to spectate how do
i spectate oh the red team isn't there yet i assume

2192
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:44,860
these guys actually look like they know what they're like
pinging like where to go and everything

2193
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:58,940
all right most likely this team would be winning so i'm just
gonna see what they're doing what are they doing that makes

2194
02:08:58,940 --> 02:08:59,920
more sense

2195
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:06,940
what are they doing oh

2196
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:22,000
wait i think because oh they warmed up though to be fair
these guys us they're more warmed up now oh they're using

2197
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:33,620
your util what the fuck oh the shared vision they're more
organized for sure they're playing together as a team i

2198
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:45,680
think oh yeah they they're they're actually playing together
uh compared to our team whenever we defend we all split up

2199
02:09:46,920 --> 02:09:47,680
You know

2200
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:57,770
Which makes sense They should just wait that these guys are
crazy.

2201
02:09:57,890 --> 02:10:12,350
They can literally all they What the fuck that's that's
illegal Yeah, look at them playing it together You can play

2202
02:10:12,350 --> 02:10:14,330
together as a team is that legal

2203
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:31,370
Dang, the game looks so much easier when they No When they
play together

2204
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:38,570
It's a completely different game

2205
02:10:48,000 --> 02:11:01,120
It really is Teamwork, gross I think also we had a lot of
like lurkers too of people just lurking around like

2206
02:11:04,410 --> 02:11:11,390
we were always like super like they were just like uh what i
noticed is that we had a lot of people who would like not we

2207
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:20,330
would just like split off and then they would just like pick
us off one by one teamwork what the fuck is that

2208
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:32,390
what the fuck is teamwork just get your ones you can't get
your ones and you're not Then you're bad at this game.

2209
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:34,030
You're not a gamer.

2210
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:38,810
Oh, he's low.

2211
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:43,350
Oh my god.

2212
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:44,490
That was such a good peek.

2213
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:51,420
Yeah, they would, like, re-rotate out.

2214
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:52,420
That's so smart.

2215
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:54,160
They're actually using their brain.

2216
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:56,780
Like, he got his one, and then he rotated out of here.

2217
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:58,020
See that?

2218
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:01,120
And then, let's all, like, congest in the area that we know
they're at.

2219
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,640
Like, holy shit, what?

2220
02:12:13,420 --> 02:12:15,120
That gun is insane.

2221
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:20,220
Yeah, now they're all converging on him.

2222
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:24,320
What the fuck?

2223
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:31,690
You can tell they come from...

2224
02:12:31,690 --> 02:12:32,130
Yeah, you can tell.

2225
02:12:32,150 --> 02:12:34,510
These are two Valorant, full-on Valorant teams.

2226
02:12:36,290 --> 02:12:40,190
They invited two Valorant pros, and then they invited all
their Valorant friends.

2227
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:45,410
I'm pretty sure Mooder's team is, like, all Valorant pros,
right?

2228
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:54,110
um pros or uh or like trying to be valent pros

2229
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:00,320
yeah they know their angles

2230
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:17,620
because i saw like some of them um some of them had were
like i saw like some of them used to be valent pros and then

2231
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:23,220
we swapped to content creation i know we had no strats

2232
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:40,000
was like motion like there's people there guys motion god
damn nerds

2233
02:13:52,210 --> 02:14:02,550
well they're actually using util i don't think we've ever
really used smokes they don't even get barbed wires do you

2234
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:11,390
guys notice that what the fuck do they get you just use
nades i think that's it yeah i don't oh wait know they do.

2235
02:14:11,690 --> 02:14:12,950
I don't... I didn't see any of their bribe.

2236
02:14:13,070 --> 02:14:13,690
Oh, there it is.

2237
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:16,010
What the fuck is... Oh, it's over here.

2238
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:16,350
Okay.

2239
02:14:16,730 --> 02:14:17,150
I don't know.

2240
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:18,070
Say, what is that?

2241
02:14:19,490 --> 02:14:19,910
Oh.

2242
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,490
Oh, that's crazy.

2243
02:14:21,490 --> 02:14:22,630
That's a crazy peak.

2244
02:14:27,590 --> 02:14:29,250
Oh, there's a lurker right here.

2245
02:14:31,150 --> 02:14:31,830
Oh, my God.

2246
02:14:31,930 --> 02:14:32,910
He didn't see him.

2247
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:38,670
Oh, there they got the first point.

2248
02:14:44,660 --> 02:14:45,120
Yay.

2249
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:46,960
Okay, now they're on attack.

2250
02:14:51,170 --> 02:15:04,130
You guys use motion wasp thank you that was me i'm the
motion girl i i'm i'm the motion girl that's me

2251
02:15:15,970 --> 02:15:25,930
yeah notice they all stick together in one area and then
slowly like they just slowly uh move around and stuff i

2252
02:15:25,930 --> 02:15:27,310
noticed that too

2253
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:43,650
You got like two and a half more hours, right?

2254
02:15:44,370 --> 02:15:45,370
Wait, no, it's happening.

2255
02:15:45,770 --> 02:15:49,030
Okay, to be fair, they're progressing actually surprisingly
very fast.

2256
02:15:49,210 --> 02:15:55,370
If you're, I don't know if you're watching this, but I could
tell why they're winning their games compared to us.

2257
02:15:55,570 --> 02:15:59,210
Okay, I can tell you right now, Doki, I am not watching the
games.

2258
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:00,650
No, it's crazy.

2259
02:16:00,690 --> 02:16:02,690
They're like actually playing together.

2260
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:04,450
That's such a unique concept to me.

2261
02:16:04,510 --> 02:16:09,630
I'm like watching, like, you can actually play together as a
team instead of having five flankers.

2262
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:16,750
Hey, first of all, Doki, why would I be watching your stream
when I'm checking out the link in the description that

2263
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:19,690
brings me to cherrypick.gg slash Doki bird.

2264
02:16:20,150 --> 02:16:20,210
That's true.

2265
02:16:20,410 --> 02:16:22,150
That seems way more interesting.

2266
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:22,710
Knock on the light.

2267
02:16:22,910 --> 02:16:23,750
I'm going to click it again.

2268
02:16:24,010 --> 02:16:28,050
Instead of watching my stream, you can play the game
yourself, right?

2269
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:31,150
In PUBG blind spot.

2270
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:34,360
Like, chat, why are you looking at her DPI and her...

2271
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:38,290
I don't know how to pronounce that mouse pad.

2272
02:16:40,010 --> 02:16:50,350
gg slash dokey bird holy shit look they're all just together
that's that's such a unique concept to me wait the stream is

2273
02:16:50,350 --> 02:17:01,370
on steam that's so cool oh wait really actually yeah if you
click your link the stream is live on the main broadcast or

2274
02:17:01,370 --> 02:17:12,930
my stream like am i on there what the fuck they're all just
like holding hands Oh, it's just watch the community play.

2275
02:17:13,070 --> 02:17:14,770
Am I watching random Korean people?

2276
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:15,850
Everything is in Korean.

2277
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:19,010
So it's not me.

2278
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:20,210
Maybe it's not.

2279
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:21,150
Yeah, I don't think.

2280
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:26,370
I don't think I might be Asian, but like I unfortunately
don't speak Korean.

2281
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:34,060
You got to be like Jay, who speaks Korean, English and
Chinese.

2282
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:39,460
Oh my god, they're so confused.

2283
02:17:43,490 --> 02:17:44,470
What is...

2284
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:45,350
What?

2285
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:46,390
What?

2286
02:17:46,670 --> 02:17:47,810
Is prod killing everybody?

2287
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:49,030
What is happening?

2288
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:49,850
Yeah, prod locked in.

2289
02:17:50,350 --> 02:17:51,930
He locked in finally.

2290
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:52,770
Is it?

2291
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:53,670
Are you for real?

2292
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:54,850
Is he going to clutch up?

2293
02:17:54,970 --> 02:17:55,590
Yeah, he is.

2294
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:57,110
Oh my god.

2295
02:17:57,390 --> 02:17:58,750
He like, this is embarrassing.

2296
02:17:59,450 --> 02:18:00,310
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2297
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:02,270
Oh my god.

2298
02:18:02,310 --> 02:18:05,030
He's using a shield to block it.

2299
02:18:05,090 --> 02:18:05,750
He has to go.

2300
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:06,850
He's got five seconds.

2301
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:08,290
You better run, buddy.

2302
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:09,270
Bro, did you not?

2303
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,130
Oh, he's hitting his shield.

2304
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:11,190
He's hitting his shield.

2305
02:18:11,190 --> 02:18:12,050
That is so smart.

2306
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:13,510
I even don't even do that.

2307
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:14,170
Wow.

2308
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:23,350
wow i know why we got knocked out i know we our brains are
not big enough for that oh it actually is really good though

2309
02:18:23,350 --> 02:18:31,910
he's a very very good player yeah i mean he did he he did
shit on us during the last round i think you like downloaded

2310
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:41,310
the game today too i did oh you're cutting in and out oh no
oh you're back you're back you're back okay well i came back

2311
02:18:41,310 --> 02:18:51,750
i i just feel like picking the attacking side was a really
good idea it's a very good idea like we gotta pick the map

2312
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:58,450
no we know the map's well enough we gotta pick the map big
dog that's what we're that's what we're picking and who's

2313
02:18:58,450 --> 02:19:06,950
who's was that heavenly or gomez i i don't remember whose
idea it was i like how our teammates were either the

2314
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:18,670
scariest people alive or on the round it's just depending on
how we feel that particular round you know is this the same

2315
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:25,590
heavenly that was here yesterday just fracking out of his
mind that was that was kill leader on day one like what

2316
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:34,990
happened yeah if your chat wants to have a laugh let's see
how far down the kill leader board heavenly fell i think i

2317
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:42,270
actually moved up too unsurprising now that you not reload
your weapon.

2318
02:19:43,630 --> 02:19:44,910
Yeah, I didn't reload at all.

2319
02:19:45,090 --> 02:19:50,210
I actually got kills for it because I didn't reload my gun
and actually went in.

2320
02:19:52,290 --> 02:19:53,970
Yeah, this is so stupid.

2321
02:19:54,170 --> 02:20:00,130
Why would I have lag on Discord when I'm basically in the
technological center of the universe in Seattle, Washington?

2322
02:20:00,490 --> 02:20:01,170
This is stupid.

2323
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:04,950
Wait, Dicey killed three and then the team killed.

2324
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:09,110
Alright, Dicey is very good.

2325
02:20:09,790 --> 02:20:14,570
I think he's one of the guys was killing us a lot yesterday
yeah he was there's just some guy said it's just like god

2326
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:22,130
you just kill so many people and you don't die i gotta i
gotta cut me a slice of that just killing people and then

2327
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:28,710
not dying i'm gonna get on that train yeah oh does that mean
you're coming back if they do another one are you coming

2328
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:35,530

2329
02:20:39,090 --> 02:20:46,050
we should have a real challenge though next next stream of
this we can only speak korean let's see how all of our

2330
02:20:46,050 --> 02:20:56,470
korean gets it's okay we just need to know like the basics
you know kill there and res me that's all maybe if doki

2331
02:20:56,470 --> 02:21:06,990
organized some more scrims and map analysis you might want
to show up i'd show up i'd show up then accidentally dc by

2332
02:21:06,990 --> 02:21:15,170
unplugging my ethernet cable you know they actually want us
to have a rehearsal and I should have said like there people

2333
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:16,270
are not showing up.

2334
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:26,090
I don't think we should have a rehearsal I I feel like 50%
will not show up Doki Doki can move on to some greener

2335
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:26,550
pastures.

2336
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:32,130
It's just like all right so now you got heavenly Gomez and
Mr. Beast.

2337
02:21:32,490 --> 02:21:37,510
Wow Mr. Beast has shown up to play in PUBG blind spot.

2338
02:21:37,870 --> 02:21:45,390
I don't think they can afford Mr. Beast I wonder even how
much he gets paid to do any sponsor.

2339
02:21:45,970 --> 02:21:47,510
It was like millions, right?

2340
02:21:49,150 --> 02:21:55,570
I just picture his bank account as just like a bottomless
bucket that he can keep pouring out of or like stick his arm

2341
02:21:55,570 --> 02:21:56,770
into and there's no bottom.

2342
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:58,190
What are they doing?

2343
02:21:58,250 --> 02:21:59,350
They're doing our strat.

2344
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:00,630
This doesn't work.

2345
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:01,710
Not against prod.

2346
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:07,350
I mean, I mean, Subroses, Muda's team is winning.

2347
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:09,630
Only, oh, that was not smart.

2348
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:12,810
Okay, Muda could absolutely destroy.

2349
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:13,810
Oh, no, he didn't do it.

2350
02:22:14,050 --> 02:22:14,810
No, no, he didn't.

2351
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:15,670
He didn't do it.

2352
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:16,190
He didn't see the flank.

2353
02:22:16,450 --> 02:22:17,130
He did not.

2354
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:19,310
He did not see it.

2355
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:19,550
Yeah.

2356
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:19,790
Yeah, bro.

2357
02:22:19,930 --> 02:22:21,170
Let's reenact the civil war.

2358
02:22:21,310 --> 02:22:24,310
Let's just walk in a straight line there, straight line and
die.

2359
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:26,070
Wait, wait, wait.

2360
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:26,830
Muna got one.

2361
02:22:27,010 --> 02:22:27,770
He got two.

2362
02:22:28,370 --> 02:22:29,230
The flank is where.

2363
02:22:29,230 --> 02:22:31,230
Why don't our flanks do that?

2364
02:22:31,630 --> 02:22:32,250
I don't know.

2365
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:32,770
Every time we play.

2366
02:22:32,770 --> 02:22:34,450
Because I was the flanker and I would.

2367
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:36,890
You would what?

2368
02:22:36,910 --> 02:22:38,330
Didn't know where my control key was.

2369
02:22:40,470 --> 02:22:41,230
I was going to see.

2370
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:42,110
You know how it is.

2371
02:22:42,830 --> 02:22:48,350
like strafing left or right and like you can't hit the
additional key with your other pinky that you need to

2372
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:54,850
because you just your your hand doesn't work like that yeah
yeah you don't you hate it when that happens holy shit

2373
02:22:54,850 --> 02:23:02,250
chat's not even taken into account one of our team members
was basically disabled heavenly and the other guy had a

2374
02:23:02,250 --> 02:23:11,210
broken wrist by disabled i mean that he was scrolling tick
tock and that is a handicap because he is not paying rodded

2375
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:23,450
yes damn all right muda's team got the first point if they
win the second game it's over i actually get to zaka early

2376
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:34,970
it has to have to be three hours doki has got her time card
in the slot i have this card out right now she's hovering

2377
02:23:34,970 --> 02:23:44,970
her she's hovering her palm over the smack button i'm at the
machine right now which is really lame because pubg blind

2378
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:53,230
spots are really fun it is a fun game but also like it's
sort of a bit shameful to be the to be knocked out in my own

2379
02:23:53,230 --> 02:24:01,770
tournament but then people be like oh and of course she made
it to the final she rigged it for herself but what do you

2380
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:09,510
play doke you play like the the what do they call like moba
hero shooters like rivals you play those i play i play yeah

2381
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:17,210
i just play i play shooters in general the only is just
tactical shooter because i'm just i i'm just i i get

2382
02:24:17,210 --> 02:24:24,290
impatient i guess because i've been the most patient i've
ever been in a shooter game like i literally sat here if you

2383
02:24:24,290 --> 02:24:31,130
play shooters doki hop on armor right now hop on armor three
i'll give you the mod list oh my you are it'll take you six

2384
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:44,750
years to download it there's only 127 mods and uh oh my god
that is so old at one point No, no, no, just so you know,

2385
02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:46,070
every game you love is Arma.

2386
02:24:46,730 --> 02:24:47,510
Every game you love is Arma.

2387
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:48,210
That's true.

2388
02:24:48,310 --> 02:24:49,490
Every game was built off of Arma.

2389
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:50,210
Because let's think about it.

2390
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:53,270
Let's just go back from PUBG Blindspot, all right?

2391
02:24:53,410 --> 02:24:55,350
Who created PUBG Blindspot?

2392
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:59,670
The guy that created PUBG, his name is Brendan Green, aka
Player Unknown.

2393
02:25:00,930 --> 02:25:06,210
He learned how to build maps and games in, you guessed it,
Arma 2 and Arma 3.

2394
02:25:06,490 --> 02:25:11,190
And the original VR that he made was just a mod of Arma 2
and Arma 3.

2395
02:25:12,830 --> 02:25:22,910
armor it's all armor rather give a shout out to to the
pioneers the pioneers of the shooter genre but too bad like

2396
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:29,690
we we did improve it though with pubg blind spot and you can
play it try it out right now by clicking the link pinned in

2397
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:36,490
the chat and the description below guys you already picked
uh gg slash gokey but you got to capitalize the d that's the

2398
02:25:36,490 --> 02:25:43,730
only capitalized or you can just click it instead of typing
it he just clicked the link yeah but that doesn't feel right

2399
02:25:43,730 --> 02:25:51,230
I feel like you want to type every in are you also somebody
that AI generates images instead of using watercolors on a

2400
02:25:51,230 --> 02:26:01,890
pastel or something on like a canvas no no no no that's a
meme that ain't me I mean it's just convenient it's just you

2401
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:08,070
know accessibility you know having the link right there that
you can just click on it no you don't get it dokey I can

2402
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:13,070
generate a whole 3D animation just with this one click, with
this one prompt.

2403
02:26:13,350 --> 02:26:17,470
You know, people are now generating Minecraft builds now
instead of building it themselves.

2404
02:26:17,870 --> 02:26:17,870
It's gross.

2405
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:20,250
Just make the decisions yourself.

2406
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:21,250
That's where the fun is.

2407
02:26:21,570 --> 02:26:22,530
Just build the dirt house.

2408
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:25,690
I know you can't build it, but just build the dirt house.

2409
02:26:25,890 --> 02:26:26,990
At least that's something.

2410
02:26:29,450 --> 02:26:32,670
Nah, just for you, I'm going to manually type out this link.

2411
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:34,550
They're going to see.

2412
02:26:35,270 --> 02:26:36,510
Give me that plus one.

2413
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:37,870
It's in manual.

2414
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:49,410
Yeah, remember the https colon slash slash uh cherry pick
okay we're gonna see if lowercase dokeybird works all right

2415
02:26:49,410 --> 02:27:04,540
try it oh i'm in oh i typed in dokeybred whoops dokeybrib
there you go it works yeah fascinating i love technology

2416
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:13,620
that's pretty cool look at that he worked so hard guys hard
typing that imagine if he had a fractured wrist and had to

2417
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:20,920
type that that's actually crazy our kill leader had a
fractured wrist and did better than all of us combined is

2418
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:31,420
that what's so sad is I thought he fractured his wrist like
playing rivals or something no he was on vacation like no he

2419
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:39,640
was like a compound fracture too like you snapped your shit
up playing no it's crazy apparently he told me he was like

2420
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:46,300
he could have died or something if he didn't like land his
fall because he was literally like on the cliff or some shit

2421
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:51,640
in like while he was hiking and he literally like tripped
and fought and then like he could have rolled down the cliff

2422
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:59,700
if he didn't like land on his wrist to stop himself going
outside i know i was like that's his first mistake i was

2423
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:08,880
like why would you why would you go outside you could you
know how you could have lived by never going outside oh man

2424
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:19,160
i don't have any friends can generate them now for like a
couple tokens depending on your lm of choice exactly who's

2425
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:24,860
your best friend i don't hang out with claude the majority
of the day actually most people don't even know what claude

2426
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:34,220
yeah i was gonna say who's claude you don't know what claude
okay claude is basically the best ai round who is he though

2427
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:41,480
well i assume he's french because his name is claude but
basically there's a lot of tedious stuff that I have yeah

2428
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:48,800
like let's say I got to do the same repetitive thing 200
times to like process motion capture data or like edit

2429
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:54,560
notepad files for materials and games yeah he'll just be
like I'll write you a script for that so you don't have to

2430
02:28:54,560 --> 02:29:02,400
click 200 times and break your risk you know I'm saying oh
holy shit I just saw seven nays being thrown at this one guy

2431
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:10,680
why do they like all of these people are always on top of
each other I don't get it it's working I know that grenades

2432
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:12,480
to kill one person.

2433
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:17,100
Oh my god.

2434
02:29:17,320 --> 02:29:18,960
Oh, they're doing this trap.

2435
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:20,600
Wait, why do we play on this map?

2436
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:22,600
Wait, this map, we're so good.

2437
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:26,440
Wait, do they let you plant anywhere inside?

2438
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:26,800
Yeah.

2439
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:27,400
Like, just the room?

2440
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:28,040
Yeah.

2441
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:28,880
That is cool.

2442
02:29:29,060 --> 02:29:31,000
Holy shit, they just gunned them down altogether.

2443
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,740
Wait, this is a sick-ass map with the easiest plant.

2444
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:40,200
Oh, they want to know unless...

Who said that bad to him?

2456
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:32,560
How dare he leave us?

2457
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:34,340
Just like my dad.

2458
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:38,200
That was fun.

2459
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:40,260
That was nice of him to pop out.

2460
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,020
It keeps me company.

2461
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:44,080
It feels less shameful.

2462
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,840
Seeing them do the things that we didn't do.

2463
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:54,200
Like, seeing how they're not playing.

2464
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:58,520
They're playing like their life depends on it.

2465
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:01,680
That's right, guys.

2466
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,500
Badger's just buying milk.

2467
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:05,940
Guys.

2468
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:08,580
Just like what my dad told me.

2469
02:31:17,020 --> 02:31:17,940
Are they like outs?

2470
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:20,920
No, they're inside I think it'd be cool.

2471
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:32,360
You can just swap plants When will badger come back doki you
said he'll come back 20 years ago look that the milk place

2472
02:31:32,360 --> 02:31:33,180
ran out of milk.

2473
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:36,600
So he's just waiting for a custom order of milk

2474
02:31:41,900 --> 02:31:50,480
Holy shit I think this team is better on attack for sure

2478
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:22,180
Alright, please, Muda, please win this game, Muda.

2479
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,860
Muda, come on.

2480
02:32:30,810 --> 02:32:31,450
Yeah.

2481
02:32:32,550 --> 02:32:36,830
They're, like, actually playing, like, insane strats right
now, like, Subrosa's team.

2482
02:32:38,210 --> 02:32:39,290
Come on, Muda.

2483
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:41,330
If you win this, it's over.

2484
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:49,910
I mean, it's crazy to see what you can actually do.

2485
02:32:50,390 --> 02:32:52,650
What you can do in this game.

2486
02:32:53,530 --> 02:32:55,470
When you have actual strategy.

2487
02:32:59,330 --> 02:33:02,630
We're going for a third match.

2488
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:06,470
Damn, you see that?

2489
02:33:06,470 --> 02:33:07,730
That team actually got kills.

2490
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:08,670
Unlike ours.

2491
02:33:10,690 --> 02:33:11,710
And who are...

2492
02:33:14,290 --> 02:33:15,030
Heavenly.

2493
02:33:16,510 --> 02:33:17,430
Bye, Heavenly.

2494
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:21,270
Damn.

2495
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:24,450
So that's sad.

2496
02:33:24,490 --> 02:33:25,350
I got kills.

2497
02:33:25,470 --> 02:33:28,410
I got kills

2498
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:45,200
Oh Oh Holy shit Okay that was such a good scan though What
the fuck This guy took a Molotov in his face And that's the

2499
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:56,080
only HP He lost like that's Bullshit I saw that Molotov
Explode on this man's face Okay

2500
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:04,580
And he actually, like, that's the amount.

2501
02:34:04,700 --> 02:34:05,980
Oh, he lost in the end.

2502
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:09,420
He's just okay.

2503
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:16,380
Guys, he's over here.

2504
02:34:17,660 --> 02:34:19,440
Oh, wait, he has to, like, super flank.

2505
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:21,300
God, they're so...

2506
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:23,300
They play so slow and cautious.

2507
02:34:26,690 --> 02:34:28,690
They actually check their angles.

2508
02:34:29,630 --> 02:34:30,630
I don't know what's that like.

2509
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:31,990
I don't do that.

2510
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:33,390
You don't need to check angles.

2511
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:35,390
in the games I play.

2512
02:34:37,390 --> 02:34:38,650
They're so smart.

2513
02:34:44,290 --> 02:34:45,930
They're actually so smart.

2514
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:47,870
Holy fuck.

2515
02:34:49,870 --> 02:34:51,130
Oh my god, they won that.

2516
02:34:52,810 --> 02:34:53,590
Bro, what is he?

2517
02:34:54,330 --> 02:34:55,090
What is he?

2518
02:34:56,130 --> 02:34:57,230
Oh, is it?

2519
02:34:57,250 --> 02:34:58,050
Did he plant?

2520
02:34:58,550 --> 02:35:00,230
Does he not know where the bomb is?

2521
02:35:00,590 --> 02:35:00,730
Oh.

2522
02:35:03,410 --> 02:35:05,970
I was just like, where is he going?

2523
02:35:06,510 --> 02:35:08,610
Does he not know where the bomb is?

2524
02:35:08,650 --> 02:35:09,930
The crypto has been diffused.

2525
02:35:12,750 --> 02:35:14,430
Yeah, no, I tunnel vision hard.

2526
02:35:17,330 --> 02:35:18,630
The shotgun has two shots.

2527
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:21,490
That's why I, like, you got to hit your shots.

2528
02:35:22,470 --> 02:35:22,930
The shotgun.

2529
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:27,410
And it has the slowest reload time of the century.

2530
02:35:31,110 --> 02:35:32,530
I think he was confused.

2531
02:35:32,610 --> 02:35:33,450
He's like, where is it?

2532
02:35:40,780 --> 02:35:42,180
That's like the worst part.

2533
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:47,480
In the moment I stopped reloading, I actually locked in.

2534
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:50,160
From day one to day two.

2535
02:35:50,300 --> 02:35:54,460
I actually, day two has actually been my best performance
for the game.

2536
02:35:56,740 --> 02:35:59,180
The moment I stopped reloading, I knew how to play the game.

2537
02:36:21,980 --> 02:36:24,580
Yeah, like Badger was like, who lived that?

2538
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:27,200
What the fuck?

2539
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:30,860
Dicey, bro, he was like, I can take them down myself.

2540
02:36:32,340 --> 02:36:35,000
Yeah, and then Badger was like, Oh, I thought you were going
to die.

2541
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:41,480
I was like, what?

2542
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:44,040
I was like, you were leaving me to die?

2543
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:48,380
What do you mean you were leaving me to die?

2544
02:36:52,690 --> 02:36:54,030
That shit does nothing.

2545
02:36:54,330 --> 02:36:55,190
The impact needs?

2546
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:03,860
Yeah, Dicey wanted to get his five.

2547
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:10,680
Bro, that is crazy.

2548
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:24,600
He lived that Muda doing the longest plank of his life Oh my
god, we actually might get a third match Oh, was that a

2549
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:25,120
flashbang?

2550
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,400
I thought that was an impact grenade

2551
02:37:30,690 --> 02:37:38,810
Yeah, I thought that was like, I thought that was a It
looked like an impact grenade So I thought that was that

2552
02:37:38,810 --> 02:37:50,690
they use their utils so well they're so bad with util that's
like one of my worst skills I just don't know how like I'm

2553
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:57,870
rude I mean I did use my my movement movement thing really
well I didn't know how to use my grenades real well I feel

2554
02:37:57,870 --> 02:38:00,270
like I was always like fuck up my nades

2555
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:08,350
my prayers are coming true

2556
02:38:12,490 --> 02:38:20,130
I think like my I think my movement placement was really
good like the placements were like the movement uh sensors

2557
02:38:20,130 --> 02:38:22,110
yeah my motion

2558
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:35,980
yeah nade's not it i was motioning though we got some motion
wait they're actually doing our strap we had this strat

2559
02:38:35,980 --> 02:38:43,840
you're stealing our strats to be fair they're using the
strap better than us

2560
02:38:52,020 --> 02:38:55,140
I think I was also like the only one pinging people

2561
02:38:59,380 --> 02:39:06,980
Because I re-binded my ping The ping keys like default is
like pretty awkward It's like X for like pinging people And

2562
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:12,000
I just pinged it on my middle mouse I like re-bind it to my
middle mouse

2563
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:21,680
It's just awkward It's a Z or X That's why I like re-binded
it

2564
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:25,970
Oh shit.

2565
02:39:26,270 --> 02:39:26,270
Yep.

2566
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:28,270
Wait, actually, this is Muda's team.

2567
02:39:28,590 --> 02:39:30,310
So they win three more points.

2568
02:39:30,990 --> 02:39:33,470
Oh, everybody is so low.

2569
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:42,990
I mean, this... Oh, this is a horrible... Like...

2570
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:44,490
It's so hard.

2571
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:49,990
I feel like some of the maps have like the weirdest bomb
plant areas, you know?

2572
02:39:50,190 --> 02:39:54,790
They're like super far from the entry... Entries?

2573
02:39:55,390 --> 02:39:55,950
The entrances?

2574
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:57,450
Or like, they're super close.

2575
02:40:01,810 --> 02:40:03,590
Oh, it's a 2v1.

2576
02:40:04,610 --> 02:40:05,370
2v1.

2577
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:08,990
Oh, 1v1.

2578
02:40:09,390 --> 02:40:09,590
Oh!

2579
02:40:10,790 --> 02:40:11,510
Dicey!

2580
02:40:11,570 --> 02:40:12,950
I think Dicey's gonna get kill leader.

2581
02:40:13,710 --> 02:40:14,010
Yeah.

2582
02:40:18,850 --> 02:40:20,270
That's crazy.

2583
02:40:21,050 --> 02:40:22,510
2v1 that.

2584
02:40:23,790 --> 02:40:24,570
That was clutch.

2585
02:40:26,310 --> 02:40:29,090
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

2586
02:40:29,810 --> 02:40:30,530
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

2587
02:40:34,530 --> 02:40:41,310
I think it's easier to just kill everybody versus planting
the bomb or like or like plant the bomb and then use it as

2588
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:53,370
bait I think use as bomb bait all right I actually now okay
I feel like if you're gonna get all right give MVP on this

2589
02:40:53,370 --> 02:41:00,150
team it would be dicey that guy's literally like carrying a
team in on his entire fucking back um I don't know about

2590
02:41:00,150 --> 02:41:13,730
like Muda's team I feel like most out of everybody if he if
this team wins if Tokyo rigging the MVP I mean it's on my

2591
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:27,610
channel this me making analysis guys I'm not rigging the
votes if it's like an obvious observation we all know I

2592
02:41:27,610 --> 02:41:31,430
think you actually might win MVP and a kill leader at this
point

2593
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:44,950
Okay, the thing is, Subrosa's team might most likely get
Kill Leader only because they played more matches.

2594
02:41:45,970 --> 02:41:52,470
So they have an advantage of playing more games compared to,
like, Muda's team.

2595
02:41:52,530 --> 02:41:53,910
Because Muda's team didn't...

2596
02:41:53,910 --> 02:41:55,890
Oh, wait, they're open-miking right now.

2597
02:41:56,950 --> 02:41:58,450
They're open-miking, but...

2598
02:41:58,450 --> 02:41:59,770
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2599
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:01,470
Hey, yo, study that Google Doc.

2600
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:02,450
Study that Google Doc.

2601
02:42:02,470 --> 02:42:04,170
You guys get very talking about...

2602
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:16,130
wow what the fuck hey yeah they get to they get one set to
grab kill leader so i think sub roses seems to get killed

2603
02:42:16,130 --> 02:42:27,950
either because like they had more opportunity to more
opportunity to um to like play games to go to go there get

2604
02:42:27,950 --> 02:42:35,030
there and then i don't know but i don't know who's going get
mvp on moodus team because i feel like all of them were

2605
02:42:35,030 --> 02:42:42,590
pretty equal i don't i didn't see it like i don't see like a
like they all seem like they're really at the same level

2606
02:42:42,590 --> 02:42:49,730
regarding like gameplay i think dicey is literally carrying
their entire team on his back i'm gonna pee while they're

2607
02:42:52,990 --> 02:43:02,990
oh yeah i'm gonna pee okay guys i'll be right back go swap
team prod prod swap teams go defense oh it's the plus sign

2608
02:43:02,990 --> 02:43:04,590
top right on top of the map

2609
02:43:58,310 --> 02:44:03,490
i'm back i'm back didn't miss out didn't miss out

2610
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:22,200
wait what did i say at i said something at

2611
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:42,660
the the style is like that comm is very appreciated dokey at
5 30 but i don't remember what i said was it what

2612
02:44:50,460 --> 02:44:56,660
did i say guys 18 minutes ago what did i say

2613
02:45:04,730 --> 02:45:09,170
it was when what did badger and i say 18

2614
02:45:12,990 --> 02:45:16,790
18 minutes ago What did Badger and I say?

2615
02:45:16,910 --> 02:45:19,050
We said a lot of things

2616
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:48,400
Panic Alright At least guys At least it's not hospital Wait
is this hospital?

2617
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:51,300
This isn't hospital right?

2618
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:59,060
I didn't even see what the map is Oh my god we're at Thank
god we're out of the fucking hospital I'm so tired of the

2619
02:45:59,060 --> 02:46:00,160
hospital hospital on that.

2620
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:03,220
Every team plays on a hospital.

2621
02:46:22,740 --> 02:46:23,960
Are they breaching that?

2622
02:46:35,350 --> 02:46:36,470
Oh my God.

2623
02:46:37,210 --> 02:46:39,230
They're so smart with their utility.

2624
02:46:40,050 --> 02:46:41,750
We don't have none of those utility.

2625
02:46:47,010 --> 02:46:47,390
Oh my God.

2626
02:46:47,470 --> 02:46:48,610
They're pooping up.

2627
02:46:50,730 --> 02:46:50,830
Oh.

2628
02:46:50,930 --> 02:46:51,590
One down.

2629
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:52,910
Two down.

2630
02:46:59,910 --> 02:47:03,130
I don't know if the shield thing is a working strategy.

2631
02:47:03,650 --> 02:47:04,410
It has to really...

2632
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:17,210
worked I will say also he's like 1 HP I feel like the shield
strat has not actually worked in anyone's favor I mean I

2633
02:47:17,210 --> 02:47:27,030
know that he's there I like how he's just like oh shit what
do I do oh wow that was a nice peak though

2634
02:47:31,650 --> 02:47:35,890
yes he's reloading he took two shots and he has to reload
there we go

2635
02:47:40,450 --> 02:47:41,930
He has one more shot.

2636
02:47:43,270 --> 02:47:44,050
There you go.

2637
02:47:44,610 --> 02:47:45,210
Let's see it.

2638
02:47:45,330 --> 02:47:46,490
That's not reliable.

2639
02:47:49,570 --> 02:47:51,270
It's not reliable.

2640
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:09,320
It's like, you gotta hit it.

2641
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,260
Because then after that one shot, you fucked.

2642
02:48:14,820 --> 02:48:16,940
Alright, it's 1-0 Muda.

2643
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,340
But Big Shield, though.

2644
02:48:19,560 --> 02:48:19,860
I don't know.

2645
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:20,800
I guess like the big...

2646
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:22,420
I mean, the Big Shield team got one.

2647
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:24,060
But I don't think that strategy has been really...

2648
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:34,300
working or maybe because uh they're more coordinated than us
for me i didn't think the big shield was working very well

2649
02:48:34,300 --> 02:48:40,840
it worked the first time only because they didn't know what
to do and then after they figured it out i was like guys i

2650
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:42,840
think we gotta stop with the big shield

2651
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:56,320
they like figured it out guys what the fuck why did he damn
that's cheeky as hell that's so cocky

2652
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:01,490
Look to the left.

2653
02:49:01,930 --> 02:49:03,790
They're going to come to the left.

2654
02:49:04,450 --> 02:49:06,190
Dude, why would you look to the...

2655
02:49:09,350 --> 02:49:13,330
He just kept looking to the right.

2656
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:18,450
Sub-Rosa, why would you not look left?

2657
02:49:21,270 --> 02:49:23,870
There's more than two angles.

2658
02:49:36,370 --> 02:49:38,630
Oh my god, that gun is strong.

2659
02:49:38,650 --> 02:49:43,350
That gun is so strong and most people down so fast

2660
02:49:48,990 --> 02:50:03,610
Oh, that's it He missed the bridge He missed the Viking
bridge That's embarrassing for you He actually missed it

2661
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:17,210
That's crazy No way there's no no way he wins these there's
no way he's like so fucking low right the thing is i'm

2662
02:50:17,210 --> 02:50:25,010
pretty sure he can shoot from oh he can't we're see the
other plant is like so there's no way he has a shotgun

2663
02:50:25,010 --> 02:50:37,750
unless he whips that oh it says one more oh red oh he
reloaded it's fucked yeah see he reloaded it's fucked

2664
02:50:46,190 --> 02:50:56,730
I think if he like If he rushed him while he was reloading
Or nah I think he could have He was actually reloading

2665
02:51:02,970 --> 02:51:11,270
But he had the other team Warp just killed him after Yeah I
lost So it's spectating time

2666
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:34,210
That's alright I had fun though Even though we got third
place I had a good time.

2667
02:51:34,510 --> 02:51:35,070
I did, though.

2668
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:35,830
I really did.

2669
02:51:36,110 --> 02:51:37,510
My team was really fun to play with.

2670
02:51:37,710 --> 02:51:38,430
I really appreciate it.

2671
02:51:38,450 --> 02:51:39,830
They were all really fun to play with.

2672
02:51:44,530 --> 02:51:46,530
Yeah, I'm in the commentator chair.

2673
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:02,850
They know he's there.

2674
02:52:04,530 --> 02:52:05,550
I mean, what are they going to do?

2675
02:52:05,690 --> 02:52:06,430
Breach it?

2676
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:09,890
They're like, where do we go?

2677
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:15,290
He actually is all like, where do we go?

2678
02:52:17,710 --> 02:52:19,390
Oh, he's gonna be a lurker.

2679
02:52:22,900 --> 02:52:23,960
That's funny.

2680
02:52:24,200 --> 02:52:26,560
He actually was actually like, wait, where do we go?

2681
02:52:27,960 --> 02:52:30,720
Because both doors got...

2682
02:52:34,540 --> 02:52:35,720
Oh, shit.

2683
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:37,040
Yeah, Dicey got one.

2684
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:40,380
Yeah, Dicey always getting the entry frag.

2685
02:52:54,750 --> 02:52:55,490
Holy shit.

2686
02:52:55,530 --> 02:52:57,230
Oh, he got knocked, but...

2687
02:52:58,250 --> 02:52:58,970
Oh, shit.

2688
02:52:59,330 --> 02:52:59,570
Oh!

2689
02:53:01,230 --> 02:53:02,450
He couldn't crawl!

2690
02:53:02,910 --> 02:53:07,390
He couldn't crawl!

2691
02:53:08,470 --> 02:53:09,450
Oh, no!

2692
02:53:10,430 --> 02:53:11,650
He couldn't crawl!

2693
02:53:14,350 --> 02:53:16,430
He's trying to crawl here!

2694
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:22,230
What the fuck from 80 miles away?

2695
02:53:22,390 --> 02:53:23,250
Nah, he's dead.

2696
02:53:24,170 --> 02:53:25,830
There's no way they're getting that res.

2697
02:53:26,910 --> 02:53:29,890
I swear to God, how do they have so much utility?

2698
02:53:30,590 --> 02:53:32,330
All I get is one grenade.

2699
02:53:32,510 --> 02:53:35,030
I feel like they get like 20 nades or something.

2700
02:53:36,170 --> 02:53:38,170
like 20 fucking nades.

2701
02:53:40,790 --> 02:53:41,790
Doesn't it?

2702
02:53:42,390 --> 02:53:43,750
Oh, there it is.

2703
02:53:43,750 --> 02:53:44,450
It's 5.

2704
02:53:47,130 --> 02:53:48,230
10 seconds remaining.

2705
02:53:49,950 --> 02:53:51,250
Oh, they're crazy, friend.

2706
02:53:51,410 --> 02:53:53,070
Oh my god, they actually got it.

2707
02:53:53,150 --> 02:53:54,430
Wait, 10 seconds remaining?

2708
02:53:54,610 --> 02:53:55,110
Bro, they win.

2709
02:53:55,630 --> 02:53:56,150
Oh my god.

2710
02:53:56,570 --> 02:53:59,770
Oh, you got a double kill with the shield.

2711
02:54:00,930 --> 02:54:02,310
That spread was crazy.

2712
02:54:02,510 --> 02:54:06,150
Okay, maybe Simone deserves the MVP from that team.

2713
02:54:07,570 --> 02:54:12,110
wait no wait that's with dicey never mind dicey deserves it
more

2714
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:32,280
one pump two kills now it's between simone and dicey i'd
pick dicey the shoddy collab yeah i think sub roses he might

2715
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:39,540
actually i think he's gonna sub roses team was warmed up
from us that's always how it goes like literally a muda's

2716
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:48,620
team way like two hours I think yeah two and a half hours I
think for us

2717
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:33,590
oh breach what the fuck what hit him okay that hit him I
mean that was that was a idea that that was an idea that

2718
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:42,690
they had no what the fuck was he thinking like what the fuck
what was that idea like now they have to get the bomb how

2719
02:55:42,690 --> 02:55:56,910

the bomb oh breaching

2721
02:56:14,850 --> 02:56:26,850

this team because they're also like equal oh wait dynamic

2722
02:56:26,850 --> 02:56:38,410

guy's crazy the hell mary the hell mary plat Never mind.

2723
02:56:39,050 --> 02:56:39,570
Dynamic now.

2724
02:56:39,950 --> 02:56:43,650
Dynamic is carrying Sarosa's team now.

2725
02:56:46,610 --> 02:56:50,290
Yeah, the thing they fucked up on is that they split up.

2726
02:56:50,410 --> 02:56:53,430
When they play together, they actually do a lot more.

2727
02:56:55,150 --> 02:56:56,010
When they play together.

2728
02:56:56,490 --> 02:56:58,210
They weren't playing together this time.

2729
02:56:59,650 --> 02:57:01,470
And then they're playing together more.

2730
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:10,300
Alright, someone make note of like, what...

2731
02:57:10,840 --> 02:57:20,060

Yeah, who would have thought playing as a team is a good

2733
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:38,240
strategy in a team game Who would have thought it's a crazy
idea

2734
02:57:41,780 --> 02:57:45,730
Honestly, very...

2735
02:57:45,730 --> 02:57:46,510
Oh my god.

2736
02:57:46,750 --> 02:57:47,650
Oh, he's...

2737
02:57:47,650 --> 02:57:50,910
Oh, he's just trying to bait for this.

2738
02:57:51,190 --> 02:57:52,090
He's revolutionary.

2739
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:54,050
A revolutionary idea.

2740
02:57:54,690 --> 02:57:56,070
Yeah, they're baiting for this.

2741
02:57:59,370 --> 02:58:01,230
They're forcing them to use all their U-tail.

2742
02:58:01,390 --> 02:58:03,130
Like, why would you waste your U-tail here?

2743
02:58:11,350 --> 02:58:13,070
Why not just bait for A?

2744
02:58:13,870 --> 02:58:14,890
Like, just go to A.

2745
02:58:16,230 --> 02:58:16,510
Right?

2746
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:18,670
Like, breach here, and then...

2747
02:58:18,670 --> 02:58:19,510
What the fuck?

2748
02:58:19,570 --> 02:58:26,730
oh wait yeah wait how the fuck do you breach this oh my god
wait how do you get to a

2749
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:45,070
bro a is so hard to breach they're like maybe they're at a
what the why is prod here did he just log back in where the

2750
02:58:45,070 --> 02:58:54,150
fuck was prod where was he in this entire game see him
running back

2751
02:58:58,170 --> 02:59:08,410
oh that's that's crazy I was gonna see where did they come
from oh my god the cross is actually real holy shit dicey

2752
02:59:08,410 --> 02:59:19,490
clutching that up to make it a 2v2 oh my god dicey I knew it
guys I told you dicey literally made this a 2v2.

2753
02:59:20,030 --> 02:59:22,390
It was a 5v2 and he made it a 2v2.

2754
02:59:25,130 --> 02:59:26,710
Oh, if they win this, it's over.

2755
02:59:28,330 --> 02:59:30,110
Guys, if they win this, it's over.

2756
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:34,300
He cleaned up.

2757
02:59:34,360 --> 02:59:35,120
He really did.

2758
02:59:39,770 --> 02:59:41,810
I told you guys, he was like baiting here.

2759
02:59:41,890 --> 02:59:43,270
He was baiting at the bottom.

2760
02:59:43,810 --> 02:59:46,370
And they ignored him because everybody was making sound on
the side.

2761
02:59:57,010 --> 02:59:59,550
Amura's team loses this is over.

2762
03:00:01,430 --> 03:00:03,030
Yeah, Dicey has to be MVP for that.

2763
03:00:03,170 --> 03:00:05,830
That was so clutch there.

2764
03:00:10,240 --> 03:00:11,120
Maybe Das?

2765
03:00:11,800 --> 03:00:12,600
I guess so.

2766
03:00:12,780 --> 03:00:14,720
I mean, he has the most kills right now.

2767
03:00:15,440 --> 03:00:18,380
Yeah, I'd say Das would be MVP on that team.

2768
03:00:32,370 --> 03:00:33,330
Why are you doing the same thing again?

2769
03:00:33,410 --> 03:00:34,450
They're baiting.

2770
03:00:40,030 --> 03:00:40,470
Breach!

2771
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:46,250
Oh, no gas.

2772
03:00:47,230 --> 03:00:48,910
I feel like that's such a waste of utility.

2773
03:00:50,130 --> 03:01:00,290
oh and then they're lurking to yeah but then they oh that
was a good zone name wait was that their own team that's

2774
03:01:00,290 --> 03:01:11,610
through no it's dice yet that's dicey's utile holy shit what
the fuck oh they're making noise so they can go this way but

2775
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:20,450
then like now they all know they're rotating though weren't
they yeah Wouldn't they all know now?

2776
03:01:24,090 --> 03:01:25,830
What the fuck happened?

2777
03:01:28,150 --> 03:01:30,370
Wait, what happened to them?

2778
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:32,850
Wait, what the fuck?

2779
03:01:33,050 --> 03:01:34,550
They lost their entire HP.

2780
03:01:35,970 --> 03:01:37,170
What happened?

2781
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:43,300
I actually don't know what happened there.

2782
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:45,280
Was there a nade there?

2783
03:01:45,740 --> 03:01:47,140
I did not see the nade.

2784
03:01:47,920 --> 03:01:49,620
Jesus Christ, they're actually all one.

2785
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:52,700
Did they like nade themselves?

2786
03:01:56,840 --> 03:01:57,800
Like, what...

2787
03:01:57,800 --> 03:01:58,720
I like...

2788
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:00,720
I don't fuck...

2789
03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:02,100
They need...

2790
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:03,480
They needed themselves!

2791
03:02:05,400 --> 03:02:06,720
Oh my god.

2792
03:02:06,860 --> 03:02:08,200
I literally was like, what?

2793
03:02:08,340 --> 03:02:10,400
I'm pretty sure the enemy team did not throw in that.

2794
03:02:11,440 --> 03:02:15,080
I was like 100% sure the enemy team did not throw that name.

2795
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:19,160
I need to know if they needed themselves or not.

2796
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,600
I'm gonna go...

2797
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:21,560
I don't know if there's replay.

2798
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:22,700
I'm gonna check if there's replay.

2799
03:02:22,720 --> 03:02:23,300
I have to.

2800
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:31,240
That's a good nade.

2801
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:31,560
Yeah.

2802
03:02:31,760 --> 03:02:32,600
Now it's hype.

2803
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:33,660
Now it's hype.

2804
03:02:34,160 --> 03:02:35,260
Now it's intense.

2805
03:02:38,020 --> 03:02:40,520
Yeah, after that clutch up, they naded themselves.

2806
03:02:41,780 --> 03:02:43,140
That's so true.

2807
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:49,240
They worked so hard to clutch that fight up and then they
naded themselves.

2808
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:50,740
That's true.

2809
03:02:50,820 --> 03:02:51,700
Throw for content.

2810
03:02:51,920 --> 03:02:53,260
Get it to three to three.

2811
03:02:55,440 --> 03:02:56,700
Make it three to three.

2812
03:03:04,210 --> 03:03:05,610
All right, what's the plan?

2813
03:03:06,150 --> 03:03:07,210
Wait, what the fuck?

2814
03:03:07,430 --> 03:03:08,110
Where's the rest of the...

2815
03:03:08,110 --> 03:03:08,970
There they are.

2816
03:03:09,530 --> 03:03:11,530
I was like, where's the rest of the team go?

2817
03:03:12,970 --> 03:03:13,490
Oh, they know.

2818
03:03:13,570 --> 03:03:14,510
They hear it.

2819
03:03:19,660 --> 03:03:20,920
Yeah, but then they know they're coming.

2820
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:22,440
Wait, can they...

2821
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:25,120
Wait, they can literally peek from here, though.

2822
03:03:32,880 --> 03:03:34,320
The split is intense.

2823
03:03:36,780 --> 03:03:39,480
Damn, they're so good at throwing nades and stuff.

2824
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:42,220
It's like they do this for a living or some shit.

2825
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,300
It's almost like they do this for a living.

2826
03:03:51,080 --> 03:03:52,420
Where the fuck was that from?

2827
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:54,620
Oh, Subrosa got one.

2828
03:03:55,540 --> 03:03:56,420
4v5 now.

2829
03:03:59,160 --> 03:04:02,280
I don't know if splitting up was the plan, guys.

2830
03:04:03,700 --> 03:04:05,500
I don't think splitting up is ever the plan.

2831
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:07,200
Oh, they're doing this shield strat again.

2832
03:04:16,310 --> 03:04:16,910
I don't know.

2833
03:04:16,990 --> 03:04:18,930
I feel like splitting up is never the right idea.

2834
03:04:21,890 --> 03:04:33,030
one minute remaining oh yeah they split up and they lost one
they're not doing very good at lurking maybe if they're

2835
03:04:33,030 --> 03:04:45,810
lucky someone will need themselves again oh so roses he won
I see with the entry oh unless no no it's 3 oh wait 3v3 it's

2836
03:04:45,810 --> 03:04:53,190
3v3 right now yeah but he's like 30 seconds

2837
03:04:57,310 --> 03:05:22,160
Oh They gotta plant 20 seconds Oh my god the platter is so
far I'm dead Oh Oh they lost Oh my god Subrosa team won Oh

2838
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:29,680
So Rosa's team won.

2839
03:05:30,580 --> 03:05:30,820
GG.

2840
03:05:31,400 --> 03:05:36,220
I think it was a little awkward because their planter guy
was so far away.

2841
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:40,120
I think that was a little awkward.

2842
03:05:40,740 --> 03:05:43,020
I think Dicey deserved the MVP there.

2843
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:45,680
100%.

2844
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:48,120
Look, we lost to the...

2845
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:50,180
We lost the team that won.

2846
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:53,440
So technically we're second place if you think about it.

2847
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:56,540
We almost won, dude.

2848
03:05:56,720 --> 03:05:58,580
We all, okay, but there was a little closer.

2849
03:05:59,240 --> 03:06:01,140
Their game was a little closer.

2850
03:06:03,420 --> 03:06:07,120
Just a little closer, you know, only a little bit closer.

2851
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:09,760
But it's basically second place for us.

2852
03:06:10,120 --> 03:06:11,320
Is there even replay?

2853
03:06:11,900 --> 03:06:12,760
I won there.

2854
03:06:13,100 --> 03:06:13,880
Math checks up.

2855
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:14,680
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2856
03:06:15,060 --> 03:06:18,040
Yeah, I think it's best of three, right?

2857
03:06:18,240 --> 03:06:19,260
Most likely, yeah.

2858
03:06:19,620 --> 03:06:20,640
It is best of three.

2859
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:21,600
But we did it!

2860
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:22,640
Oh, my God.

2861
03:06:24,480 --> 03:06:37,680
to sub roses team um that was a fun tournament to watch even
though i did send the commentator share guys no you guys i

2862
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:46,020

2864
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:11,180
like locked into the POV whatever the fuck happened there
like it was like whatever it was it was interesting oh I

2865
03:07:11,180 --> 03:07:23,660
have a solo interview let's interview the loser the team
that got knocked out first how did you feel I'd be like It's

2866
03:07:23,660 --> 03:07:30,620
cool sitting in the chair It was My team was like peace And
then it was just me

2867
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:39,140
Oh man The shade The interview of shame

2868
03:07:44,250 --> 03:07:50,690
I need to ask I need to know like Was whose team self-nated
themselves Was it subrosa's team that needed themselves Or

2869
03:07:50,690 --> 03:08:03,110
Muda's team I actually could not I forgot which team it was
yeah congrats I wore it our team helped you guys warm up

2870
03:08:03,110 --> 03:08:17,870
like even though even though we got knocked out first today
our team had the most fun it was the roses okay then I can

2871
03:08:17,870 --> 03:08:21,330
ask that I'd be like so was that did you guys nated
yourself?

2872
03:08:22,010 --> 03:08:23,370
Like, what happened?

2873
03:08:24,170 --> 03:08:25,390
It had to be a self-nate.

2874
03:08:25,490 --> 03:08:27,770
I did not see a nate from the enemy team.

2875
03:08:28,470 --> 03:08:33,610
I was, like, watching the enemy team, and I was like, wait,
there's, like, three people with no HP left.

2876
03:08:34,030 --> 03:08:35,290
Like, what the fuck happened?

2877
03:08:36,050 --> 03:08:38,190
I swear to God, they had health.

2878
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:42,800
Like...

2879
03:08:44,380 --> 03:08:45,860
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

2880
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:47,680
Honestly, I would say vote for Dicey.

2881
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:50,840
That's where I'm influencing the votes right now.

2882
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:52,360
I say vote for Dicey.

2883
03:08:52,380 --> 03:08:57,660
I see because that guy literally made a 5v2 a 2v2 and won
the game

2884
03:09:01,230 --> 03:09:06,430
yeah although we were third place we were first place buys I
agree

2885
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:14,810
I agree guys

2886
03:09:23,510 --> 03:09:33,350
most votes are manipulating the votes oh yeah take that oh
yeah if you're complaining take that to the host of the

2887
03:09:33,350 --> 03:09:34,630
tournament That's right.

2888
03:09:34,890 --> 03:09:48,490
I'm the host of the tournament I am the manager You
complaining then complain to the manager Which also happens

2889
03:09:48,490 --> 03:09:49,430
to be me

2890
03:09:54,370 --> 03:10:01,030
If I could I would have given my own team the money I'm
joking I would not I would not I would not

2891
03:10:10,890 --> 03:10:13,390
Yeah, we warmed them up for them.

2892
03:10:15,870 --> 03:10:18,070
Don't use that power.

2893
03:10:21,090 --> 03:10:23,210
Be the change you want to be.

2894
03:10:24,390 --> 03:10:25,250
That's me.

2895
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:33,280
It was rigged from the...

2896
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:34,080
They stopped me.

2897
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:36,100
They stopped me from rigging it.

2898
03:10:36,980 --> 03:10:37,940
They were like winners.

2899
03:10:38,480 --> 03:10:43,060
Only winners can have MVP.

2900
03:10:46,020 --> 03:10:50,660
Bro Whoa, hey Heavenly Did you have fun bro?

2901
03:10:50,960 --> 03:10:57,580
Yeah, I had actually had so much fun Dude, so roses team
nated themselves And then they were literally like So

2902
03:10:57,580 --> 03:11:04,200
healthy and then I think they nated themselves And then
three of them were like literally 1 HP But they still won

2903
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:11,360
though We technically lost to the champion team Yeah, but we
also technically beat the champion team one time too So

2904
03:11:11,360 --> 03:11:20,020
technically we're second place if you think about it We're
second place Yeah yeah we get paid out bro yeah yeah so like

2905
03:11:20,020 --> 03:11:26,840
who how do you get mvp oh it's just it's the winning team
mvp we i manipulated the votes i was like yeah i should all

2906
03:11:26,840 --> 03:11:36,060
vote for dicey because that guy literally it was like 5v2
and then he made it a 2v2 and then won the game wait wait

2907
03:11:36,060 --> 03:11:41,560
he's the one that blew him up no we don't know i don't know
who blew who dated themselves but like he was the guy that

2908
03:11:41,560 --> 03:11:46,780
we had the problem with the most when we played against that
oh bringing in the superstar we've already stolen her

2909
03:11:46,780 --> 03:11:52,620
channel for far too long dokey we apologize we'll give it
back to you we promise we want to thank you obviously for

2910
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:58,320
the creative match and yes i've got to say first let's get
out of the way first right you said you had to do the walk

2911
03:11:58,320 --> 03:12:04,940
of shame yeah i had fun at the chair the commentator chair
yeah why did you come in here you should have come in here

2912
03:12:04,940 --> 03:12:11,740
and covered it in here with us no i have no input i was just
like being like wow so this is what a team play is like like

2913
03:12:11,740 --> 03:12:20,800
i was like oh my god everyone's playing together what what a
revolutionary idea i was like our team was like all right

2914
03:12:20,800 --> 03:12:25,880
guys let's get our ones and then it was like two of us
anchoring and then all everyone else would just be like

2915
03:12:25,880 --> 03:12:34,940
lurking around and it was a good show in there i'm not gonna
take anything away from you you had team play you picked the

2916
03:12:34,940 --> 03:12:40,540
site especially semi-final you went for the breach i'm not
buying that you didn't have team play you guys were just

2917
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:48,260
having a lot of fun yeah we were definitely a fun team we we
are we i don't even know we had plans going in we just like

2918
03:12:48,260 --> 03:12:55,880
alright guys let's go in and then we had we just adapt on
the fly and i'm like we did take a lot of points though we

2919
03:12:55,880 --> 03:13:03,720
got a lot of kills from that from from our our no no plan
strat oh look i've got to ask a question before we move on

2920
03:13:03,720 --> 03:13:08,720
but i'm gonna ask questions about your team who's your mvp
you can pick yourself i don't mind how's your mvp in your

2921
03:13:08,720 --> 03:13:16,580
team your team come on but we won't get our MVP won't even
get paid though pay but he's the love that's counting i want

2922
03:13:16,580 --> 03:13:24,020
to know who was who was the person who's going to get the
love oh man that's hard i didn't think about that i thought

2923
03:13:24,020 --> 03:13:31,980
we were all mvps that's why yeah i thought we were i i will
you know i will say uh maybe maybe super gomez because he

2924
03:13:31,980 --> 03:13:38,680
was playing with a fractured wrist but somehow he was yeah
he's playing with a fractured wrist and he somehow was kill

2925
03:13:38,680 --> 03:13:46,360
leader it was like on day one it was also kill leader for us
on day two So, like, I was telling, like, magic.

2926
03:13:46,640 --> 03:13:52,420
I was like, it's crazy that Super Gomez had a fracture wrist
and then had more kills than all of us combined.

2927
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:56,060
I was like, oh, my days.

2928
03:13:56,240 --> 03:13:58,820
If I would have known that, that's why you put Super in
front of his name.

2929
03:13:58,880 --> 03:14:00,980
He's one hand, just killing people all the time.

2930
03:14:01,340 --> 03:14:05,820
Yeah, he was like, guys, he was like, guys, it's good that
we got knocked out because I should not be playing this game

2931
03:14:05,820 --> 03:14:07,340
of this wrist right now.

2932
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:16,960
But you know, I will say, even though we got knocked out
first, a champion team so technically we're second place

2933
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:18,240
because we warmed them up

2934
03:14:21,460 --> 03:14:29,040
yeah we gave them that warm up and more importantly i took
your game strategy as well because they stacked together

2935
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:33,860
they put a wheel yeah they're like what the they're like
what the fuck were they doing like let's make sure we don't

2936
03:14:33,860 --> 03:14:41,440
do that like look you warmed them up you sent them on to a
victory but it's big ggs how let's let's just break down

2937
03:14:41,440 --> 03:14:47,920
before we bring the the grand final interview though how did
you find it how did you find pubg blind spot the game the

2938
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:53,500
dynamic the agents what's just kind of takeaways or or maybe
the convince of the people that might be watching that

2939
03:14:53,500 --> 03:14:58,200
haven't downloaded the game yet why should they be getting
this game downloaded and playing all right if you have a

2940
03:14:58,200 --> 03:15:04,360
group of friends it's actually really really fun because we
were so silly you know we were like we were so silly and

2941
03:15:04,360 --> 03:15:10,180
chaotic on our side and also if you get the game and try it
out by the way click on the link pinned in our chat by the

2942
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:13,720
way Wild PUBG blind spot right now.

2943
03:15:14,820 --> 03:15:19,760
Anyway, so what we definitely learned is that we should all
be crouching when we're shooting because we're like, wait,

2944
03:15:20,660 --> 03:15:22,440
wait, crouching is so OP.

2945
03:15:24,140 --> 03:15:26,040
And that's how we always died.

2946
03:15:26,220 --> 03:15:27,920
We died because people were crouching.

2947
03:15:29,320 --> 03:15:30,240
Yeah, you're not alone that one, Mark.

2948
03:15:30,420 --> 03:15:31,760
I mean, Mark, tell us your story.

2949
03:15:31,900 --> 03:15:33,200
Tell us your story about your first game, huh?

2950
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:36,500
Yeah, I forgot that the control button shoots the gun down.

2951
03:15:37,260 --> 03:15:40,620
So I was that person just shooting it by everyone's head and
not getting anyone.

2952
03:15:40,660 --> 03:15:41,460
I'm like, why is no one dying?

2953
03:15:41,860 --> 03:15:49,080
yeah i re-binded that i was like could left control his
crouch for me so far away from it yeah absolutely love it

2954
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:53,280
though enough really good play obviously it's been a
pleasure having you win obviously unfortunately quite get

2955
03:15:53,280 --> 03:15:59,720
through to the finals but we do need to bring in the
interview for the finals because subrosa yes you warmed them

2956
03:15:59,720 --> 03:16:06,980
up and obviously we set them on their way to a victory but
they were a team that always kind of went down game number

2957
03:16:06,980 --> 03:16:11,300
one but were able to kind of work themselves into a victory.

2958
03:16:11,580 --> 03:16:14,940
So is there any kind of takeaways before we bring him in
that actually, like, do you know what?

2959
03:16:14,980 --> 03:16:18,480
You did warm him up, but how strong were there as a team to
actually fight against him?

2960
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:24,000
They were really good at adapting on the fly, and they
played together a lot, which was something we, like, didn't

2961
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:24,320
do.

2962
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:28,320
So like, whatever, they, like, bone rushed us.

2963
03:16:28,340 --> 03:16:31,020
We were like, oh my God, they're all here.

2964
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:35,420
So they were very coordinated.

2965
03:16:35,460 --> 03:16:42,020
I could tell they were very coordinated, and they definitely
had like comms and stuff and everything so um oh they're

2966
03:16:42,020 --> 03:16:48,880
here they're about to say right there's a little trick here
we're meant to like g them up first okay we're meant to go

2967
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:55,040
well look we've got to say thank you for you but more
importantly we have the winners not just one but we have the

2968
03:16:55,040 --> 03:17:03,420
whole team in chat big ggs though subros are the
heavyweights though of dokey bird's creator well done ggs

2969
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:07,420
let's um there's a lot of you here let's let's Let's start.

2970
03:17:07,780 --> 03:17:10,300
Dicey, let's start with you, mate, because you got the
kills.

2971
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:11,880
You've already got money in your back pocket.

2972
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:12,860
Big GG's, man.

2973
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:13,900
How did you find the game?

2974
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,040
Because you were a killing machine.

2975
03:17:16,420 --> 03:17:17,420
It was a great game.

2976
03:17:17,740 --> 03:17:21,320
It was a steep learning curve about the movement and holding
angles.

2977
03:17:21,600 --> 03:17:26,860
But I feel like since we all came from Valorant, all five of
us, it really translated over with the strategy and just

2978
03:17:26,860 --> 03:17:27,800
having an open mind.

2979
03:17:28,060 --> 03:17:33,720
And just the natural, I just feel like we're all just
naturally gifted in the FPS or just shooting game genre.

2980
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:36,600
So it was an overall fun experience.

2981
03:17:37,080 --> 03:17:42,000
but good definitely definitely a team game we get the vibes
from the from the team let's let's let's get some more

2982
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:48,140
thoughts though dynamic you came into after day number one
kind of one of the mvps one of the guys leading the charge

2983
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:54,060
though what was the kind of game strategy for you guys
though getting ready for day number two uh honestly we

2984
03:17:54,060 --> 03:18:02,240
didn't prepare as much as the other team unfortunately no
massive page document no like 10 page you know no yeah it

2985
03:18:02,240 --> 03:18:09,560
was bad they did a lot of preparation which is respectable
but it came a little short but we had a good igl a subrosa

2986
03:18:09,560 --> 03:18:16,220
leading the charge with all these strats it was honestly
just all up to his calls and we uh just had to execute them

2987
03:18:16,220 --> 03:18:23,940
well so ggs look big ggs there obviously prod look you come
in second day um you're playing my favorite character the

2988
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:30,800
agent of choice though drop out you played it well um
obviously you did bounce about a couple of others what kind

2989
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:37,020
of set your thought process did you did you guys have what
you guys were playing, attacking or defensive, or was it a

2990
03:18:37,020 --> 03:18:37,640
bit of a free room?

2991
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:40,020
Yeah, I want to be honest, everything was a free room.

2992
03:18:40,200 --> 03:18:45,160
I honestly came into this tournament today on the first day,
thinking we were guaranteed going to lose, considering I was

2993
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:46,100
seeing the other levels.

2994
03:18:46,540 --> 03:18:50,500
But as soon as I saw the names beside the levels, I knew for
a fact we were bound to win this tournament.

2995
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:54,720
Moody's team was very, very bad for the amount of time they
put into this video game.

2996
03:18:55,100 --> 03:19:00,660
And considering we heard their comms and they said that they
had a lot of documents studying our gameplay, I was very

2997
03:19:00,660 --> 03:19:07,140
confused on why they looked like they were running around
like happy that we won absolutely love it simon come on

2998
03:19:07,140 --> 03:19:13,260
let's hear from you is it the same thing were you guys just
having a bit of fun a bit of a banter in the game we're not

2999
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:18,820
going to talk about any specific rounds but i'll tell you
there was one around specifically where prod first like for

3000
03:19:18,820 --> 03:19:28,180
the first time used a grenade i want to kill two of you we
saw it we saw it and oh yes and he didn't pick drop out the

3001
03:19:28,180 --> 03:19:34,880
next time if i remember right as well he kind of swaps it up
we we said it's going to be a lot of you after the game for

3002
03:19:34,880 --> 03:19:42,120
sure we told him it's going to be bad well look it was uh
it's an interesting learning curve it's a learning curve to

3003
03:19:42,120 --> 03:19:49,700
victory look don't you look i've got to give you the stage
this is your show look the the the lad to yours ask away get

3004
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:55,440
the strats out of them oh yeah no i the only thing i want to
ask was like did you actually need yourself because i like

3005
03:19:55,440 --> 03:20:01,240
looked there it's like how did three people lose hp so fast
i was like I was looking at the enemy team.

3006
03:20:01,360 --> 03:20:03,580
I was like, they did not do anything.

3007
03:20:03,820 --> 03:20:04,520
I was...

3008
03:20:05,580 --> 03:20:07,960
Connor, if you don't mind, can I answer this one?

3009
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:15,560
I mean, he honestly, he did nade us, but he really felt bad
for the other team because it was actually embarrassing what

3010
03:20:15,560 --> 03:20:16,140
they were doing.

3011
03:20:16,540 --> 03:20:20,080
So he kind of was thinking like, let me make...

3012
03:20:20,080 --> 03:20:22,020
He was trying to think like, let me make it fair.

3013
03:20:22,380 --> 03:20:23,160
Let me make it fair.

3014
03:20:23,580 --> 03:20:24,780
Let's do a 3v5.

3015
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:29,820
Because honestly, like, you guys saw on the mainstream, when
it was 5v5, like...

3016
03:20:29,840 --> 03:20:38,420
they were sorry like hey hey every time they peeked around
the corner i feel like i had 10 seconds to kill these guys

3017
03:20:38,420 --> 03:20:46,380
oh my god it was definitely a pity nade i agree with them it
was it was 100 of pity nade we thought we put a bit of a

3018
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:54,920
challenge on our backs and you know it's uh it didn't help
them that much did it so yeah the end is the same we

3019
03:20:54,920 --> 03:20:56,160
basically just delayed the inevitable

3020
03:20:59,840 --> 03:21:07,600
you know i want to make it close you know like a 3v3 gate
like 3v3 yeah yeah exactly i completely agree oh yeah we're

3021
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:14,020
definitely not going to talk about that one round where
we're me and dicey had the 2v5 the entire thing oh yeah that

3022
03:21:14,020 --> 03:21:20,480
one was good i was crucial we were just flabbergasted though
we were like what's happening there's one there's two

3023
03:21:20,480 --> 03:21:26,160
there's three they're all gone like what the hell happened
it felt like they lined up for you though they just came one

3024
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:28,760
at a time You're just like, yeah, free, free kill, free
kill.

3025
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:32,160
There's just some things you can't prep for in the Google
Doc.

3026
03:21:32,400 --> 03:21:33,320
That's just, that's all I have to say.

3027
03:21:34,260 --> 03:21:36,080
There's just some things that you just can't prep for.

3028
03:21:36,740 --> 03:21:36,820
Yeah.

3029
03:21:37,620 --> 03:21:38,560
Absolutely love it.

3030
03:21:38,940 --> 03:21:39,940
Either have it or you don't.

3031
03:21:40,140 --> 03:21:41,500
You know, like, yes, it is.

3032
03:21:42,060 --> 03:21:47,940
Well, look, last one for me before I let you guys go and
I've got to, I've got to ask you, Subrosa.

3033
03:21:48,020 --> 03:21:48,220
Yep.

3034
03:21:48,500 --> 03:21:51,840
I've referred to you guys as the heavyweights when it comes
down to this tournament.

3035
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:55,580
It felt like you as a team always took the first big blow.

3036
03:21:56,600 --> 03:22:02,920
lost to start with and it started to feel like this was the
game plan like a full sense of security you take the loss

3037
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:09,400
you adapt you change was that what you guys wanted to get
into was it was it mind games at the at the very first

3038
03:22:09,400 --> 03:22:15,980
offset or was it kind of a let's see what you guys have got
and then we adapt to how you play so honestly since we have

3039
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:22,820
less hours than everybody we kind of have to download their
playstyle you know and and has our team or us five like we

3040
03:22:22,820 --> 03:22:32,140
have very high load every I will say that is not true our
team had even less hours but I'm not I'm gonna let him have

3041
03:22:32,140 --> 03:22:40,040
this I was like excuse me our team at two players with level
one yourself a champion round of applause though you're back

3042
03:22:40,040 --> 03:22:47,320
in the line share the prize I'm not gonna have lost words
from you guys I don't think they have the least hours I mean

3043
03:22:47,320 --> 03:22:53,680
literally the Google document the chosen one

3044
03:22:57,040 --> 03:23:02,260
well i like to say uh this game was actually very very fun i
didn't know to think about it at the beginning but it was

3045
03:23:02,260 --> 03:23:07,180
very fun i will say though if you guys do a tournament in
the future i'd hope for some stronger opponents because the

3046
03:23:07,180 --> 03:23:15,360
end game hopefully we actually get some competitive players
for the next i just want to say that's that's mainly

3047
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:21,340
directed at team muda the chosen one yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay i was gonna say my team helped you guys warm up there

3048
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:22,360
my team

3049
03:23:26,600 --> 03:23:33,600
most fun to play with because they actually made sense what
they did oh no we did we did not have a plan going in i just

3050
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:38,700
want you to know it looked like you guys did it looked like
you looked from here like they did don't thank you we're not

3051
03:23:38,700 --> 03:23:49,740
buying you had game strategy i'm telling you if you heard
our cops there was no no thinking in that head there our

3052
03:23:49,740 --> 03:23:52,660

3056
03:24:15,160 --> 03:24:21,280
thank you okay you don't go anywhere you're staying here
with us though you gotta stay it's your show because

3057
03:24:21,280 --> 03:24:24,140
unfortunately we do have to hand back the channel.

3058
03:24:24,520 --> 03:24:27,060
MVP, though, has gone down towards Dicey.

3059
03:24:27,360 --> 03:24:29,340
So obviously Gigi's there.

3060
03:24:29,420 --> 03:24:31,600
I manipulated the votes there for that.

3061
03:24:32,240 --> 03:24:32,480
Yeah.

3062
03:24:33,640 --> 03:24:34,280
I hate that.

3063
03:24:34,420 --> 03:24:35,660
That's part of your job, right?

3064
03:24:36,420 --> 03:24:39,280
I was like, everyone vote for Dicey and they were like, all
right.

3065
03:24:41,380 --> 03:24:44,660
So he's got some extra money as well on the board.

3066
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:47,000
So he's got the kill and he's got the MVP.

3067
03:24:47,200 --> 03:24:50,720
So an extra $3,000 plus the $7,000 for the team, though.

3068
03:24:50,940 --> 03:24:55,760
Look, Doki, final words from yourself look as again
