1
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,760
Today we're going to be playing Mugenics.

2
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,080
It's a game I've been wanting to try out for a very, very
long time.

3
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,620
Well, I mean, it came out like two weeks ago.

4
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,340
The entire two weeks I've been wanting to play this game.

5
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,440
Oh my god.

6
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,940
The longest two weeks of my life.

7
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,100
I heard a lot of positive things about Mugenics.

8
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,320
Also, I feel like dad is way too tall.

9
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm sorry, dad.

10
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,920
You're way too tall on the screen.

11
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,660
I gotta kick you up.

12
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,980
out.

13
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,460
I got a little too tall.

14
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,620
Let's see.

15
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,840
Um, well, sorry.

16
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,680
Get out.

17
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,980
It's Mugenics time.

18
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,700
Cats only.

19
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,640
I'm sorry, Dad.

20
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,240
This is a cats only lobby.

21
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:35,280
Anyway, um, it is a genre that I usually do not like playing
and it's a, was a tactical turn-based, uh, roguelike and I'm

22
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,660
not very good with tactical stuff.

23
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,340
So, but I have heard a lot of really good things about this
game.

24
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,560
I heard it's very addicting.

25
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,160
Most likely we will never complete this game because I heard
someone chat was like, this game is 250 hours long.

26
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,520
I'm like, ha ha ha ha.

27
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,340
All right.

28
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,260
This might be a good one-off game.

29
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,060
Maybe something I might play on Twitch later on in the
future.

30
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,960
Who knows?

31
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,460
Yeah, apparently it is.

32
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,860
It's by the creators.

33
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,660
It's by the creators of Binding of Isaac.

34
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,340
And they've been working on this game.

35
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,340
For a very, very long time.

36
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,140
I believe, like...

37
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,260
I know it's like...

38
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,680
6 plus years, right?

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,360
They've been working on it for a long time.

40
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,000
The craziest shit is that...

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
What's his name?

42
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,660
I think...

43
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,820
And this is the craziest fun fact.

44
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,160
But Chris Chan is in this game.

45
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,660
Apparently, you have the potential to breed a...

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,580
Sonic 2 in Mugenics and it is voice acted by the Chris Chan.

47
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,880
So that's very interesting.

48
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,180
That's yeah.

49
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,920
And obviously the cats that you get is RNG.

50
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,760
You cannot sadly, the one thing that I felt was can confirm
it is real.

51
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:23,720
Unfortunately, the only thing that I will say is a huge con
for me for this game is that you cannot change the names of

52
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,240
the cats.

53
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,660
So the cats can come from your friends list.

54
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,060
It can come from the database, but you cannot change the
cat's names.

55
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,700
They have a lot of cat names in there and a lot of cats that
you can get.

56
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:47,180
rename the cat they were born with that name it's their
chosen name um we beg emin enough maybe we can get vtuber

57
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:55,160
voices for the next dlc thank you the super chat doctor
thank you thank you anyway anyway let's try out mugenics uh

58
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:05,120
the best thing i heard about this game is is the is the
inbreeding i mean the breeding the breed

59
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,860
Anyway, I heard the soundtrack was really good, guys.

60
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,140
You, Genics.

61
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,640
All right, let me know the sound is okay.

62
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:27,820
Apparently, the intro, there's like 250 variations of the
intro.

63
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,740
It's like the Simpsons intro.

64
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,500
So, sound guy, if you are here, I would need to know.

65
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,900
I would need to know if the sound is okay.

66
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,890
So, yes, you can...

67
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,830
Breed your cats.

68
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,030
It's all about...

69
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,510
Oh, meow.

70
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:47,750
What is that?

71
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,270
So, one of those meows could have been Chris Chan.

72
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,410
I'm just saying.

73
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,050
One of those meows could have been...

74
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,830
What's normal, safe, random?

75
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,450
Alright, I mean normal.

76
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,270
We're not fucking pussies.

77
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,750
We're not prudes here.

78
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,710
We got the birds and the bees talk.

79
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,590
Alright.

80
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,210
Uh...

81
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,890
Video settings.

82
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,370
Okay, maybe it was not uncapped.

83
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,950
I don't think I need that many frames to watch two cats
bang.

84
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,430
I, I, I, I'm pretty sure I'm fine.

85
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,690
Meow, meow.

86
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,110
What do you mean?

87
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,050
It's all cats.

88
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,070
What do you mean?

89
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:44,890
It's random.

90
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,850
All right, we'll do random.

91
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,730
All right, well, we'll do random.

92
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,610
Apparently random is very funny.

93
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
There's some funny ones.

94
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,390
All right, all right.

95
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:03,850
we'll do random then um what is the it's so sad to see my oh
she gave up on love and become a crazy cat lady so i know

96
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:14,870
right we don't think i'd be the crazy weiner dog lady uh
it's crazy i can't believe it your bets on the betting

97
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:21,270
website failed yet again you guys okay it's actually insane
that people are actually like betting random things now on

98
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:27,630
those like betting websites um i don't know Like, because,
like, everybody would bet on, like, there's so many betting

99
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,630
websites for so many random things now.

100
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:37,590
There's one for the Super Bowl where, like, I read a tweet
about how somebody bet on the Super Bowl that someone was

101
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,750
going to start, like, running on the field.

102
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,090
And then, yeah, prediction records.

103
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,890
So, like, and then, and then, obviously, during the Super
Bowl, nobody was running on the fields.

104
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,850
So, he, like, instead, he, like, went on the field himself
and started running in it.

105
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,310
And then he earned like $200,000 from the prediction he
made.

106
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,290
And then got five to $1,000.

107
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,050
Yeah.

108
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,870
Yeah, 10K that he's going to cop three times the stream.

109
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,650
Yeah.

110
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,610
Yeah, apparently like people are like betting on like,
betting on like random things now.

111
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,830
But yes, it's that crazy.

112
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,170
You lost the bet.

113
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,030
I wasn't going to...

114
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,830
I became a crazy cat lady instead of the crazy weird.

115
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,810
dog lady.

116
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,590
Oh, he lost it because he talked so fucking that guy is so
goddamn stupid.

117
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,370
Why would you tell anyone?

118
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,350
He's like, yeah, I cheese the system.

119
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,870
Anyway, cops, here's my hat.

120
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,550
You can handcuff me right now.

121
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,050
That's crazy.

122
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,970
Why would you tell anyone?

123
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,030
You're like, yeah, I found the loophole.

124
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,430
Anyway, cops, my address is bumped up and here's my zip code
too.

125
00:10:51,530 --> 00:11:06,000
And my address as well if you want it he did it for him the
love of the game now he's like in jail and like now he lost

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:18,400
his lost 200k and got fine a thousand dollars at the super
bowl also sound do we have any sound guys alive do we have

127
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,980
any yeah you admit to cheating when the statues of
Limitations are over.

128
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,080
That's what I did.

129
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Oh, hey.

130
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,280
Alright.

131
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,840
There's my cat.

132
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,000
Science!

133
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,380
Scared you, didn't I?

134
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,740
I don't know how scary a buzzword like science can be these
days.

135
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,660
But trust me when I say science can actually be a good thing
sometimes.

136
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,720
Take this table, for instance.

137
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,500
A science made this table and the floor it sits on.

138
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,600
There are even people there who believe that a science made
you and I.

139
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,220
But I digress.

140
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,220
The point I was trying to make here is that cats are a
science too.

141
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,680
A science that I, Thomas A.

142
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,280
Venus, invented.

143
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,560
Wait, was the artwork also made by one guy?

144
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,040
Because it's the by-new Isaac.

145
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,320
Art style or is it a team of artists that just...

146
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,620
copy the art style but what do you have to do with all of
this well word on the street is you're a bit of

147
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:39,260
felineologist yourself i know you just we just met by bet if
you and i put our brains to get beans to get brains to get

148
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,740
it we could actually change the world it's one guy that's
crazy i heard like he made back his entire budget for this

149
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,960
game in like three hours oh he had a team okay uh oh That's
cool for Isaac Fanners.

150
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,580
That's cool.

151
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,560
Yeah, then they could follow like the The artwork style what

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
Well, I'll even show it on stream.

171
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,560
So they're like, don't make her too sexy, guys, because
that's not part of the style.

172
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,160
King of the hell.

173
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,500
It's like the animator guide.

174
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,280
Because they have to be like on...

175
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,180
What's the word for it?

176
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,700
Like on model or some shit.

177
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
That's the problem with...

178
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,220
I think a lot of people complain about Steven Universe.

179
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,000
Because like they're never on model.

180
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,860
Same with the new Powerpuff Girls reboot.

181
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,800
They were never like on model.

182
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,360
And people were always complaining about it.

183
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,080
Because they never...

184
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
They never looked like the characters.

185
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,880
Like they were like super inconsistent.

186
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,660
They were like off model and everything.

187
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,280
If you get ugly cats, you can...

188
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,180
I...

189
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,480
We live with our ugliness.

190
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,460
Anyway, here's a little fun fact.

191
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,500
Don't draw Peggy too shapely.

192
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,200
That's sexy Peggy.

193
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,160
And that's animators drink.

194
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,260
Yes, no.

195
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,060
We live with our...

196
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,220
God gave us ugly cats.

197
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,000
So we gotta live with it.

198
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,380
Like, we start if the cats aren't ugly enough.

199
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,040
Alright, now take a gander at these fine specimens.

200
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,640
This is my latest batch.

201
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,780
Straight out of their bio vats.

202
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,220
Choose to a boy and a girl.

203
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Trust me, you'll find out why later.

204
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,460
Meow.

205
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,120
Meow.

206
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,900
Oh my god, I love his butt head.

207
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,020
I like how I heard meow.

208
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay, I'm going to do a gamby.

209
00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:03,660

me to pass on the best of the bunch whatever their pieces

212
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:36,560
will be put to use you can't if your baby is ugly you can't
just re-roll the baby guys we gotta live with it in fact i

213
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:45,180
think with my brain technically you can but then it's not
accepted in society um we do have orphanages for a reason in

214
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:54,720
fact i think uh i think with my brains and your ability to
choose less than ideal cats we could really things up hell

215
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:03,020
enough cats i bet we could reverse time maybe even make
dying impossible ania's a nuke radioactive blood a bit of

216
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:12,160
elbow grease don't worry i'll be sure to harvest some from
you's elbows before she's incinerated oh oh oh so that's

217
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:22,440
what happened you know it's her fault for being born too
ugly uh it's it's not my fault i let you guys vote.

218
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,220
You let this happen, guys.

219
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,740
I was gonna save her.

220
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,180
I was gonna save her, guys.

221
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,440
You let this happen.

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,460
Go into the world and hoard some cats.

223
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,260
That's not... Her blood is on your hands.

224
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,820
You wasn't ugly enough.

225
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,520
I asked you guys your opinion.

226
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,420
I let you vote.

227
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,440
Click here.

228
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,580
He kicked you out?

229
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
Yeah, he does that.

230
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,060
Names butch, even though I could give a frick if you live or
die.

231
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,480
I can't help but see a bit of myself in you.

232
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,520
If you get what I mean, you want to survive in Boon County,
you're going to need to learn how to fight.

233
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
So listen up.

234
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,020
This is your team.

235
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,140
These are your enemies.

236
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,220
Your goal is to kill them all.

237
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,560
Alright, battle is now Gambo's turn.

238
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,420
above Gambo's head.

239
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,720
This is Gambo's basic attack.

240
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,480
It's melee range, so you'll need to move next to the rat to
hit it.

241
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,460
This is your movement action.

242
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,280
You can move once.

243
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,880
Okay, there you go.

244
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,380
The tactical part of the game.

245
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Click it.

246
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,620
And then click the tile you want to move.

247
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Okay.

248
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,520
Move.

249
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,560
Alright, get next to that rat.

250
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
Now that you're next to the rat, you can attack it.

251
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh, okay.

252
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,920
I can attack on the same move of my movement.

253
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,900
Click attack and then Click the rat.

254
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,040
Bam!

255
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,520
Bye, rat.

256
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:55,980
Sweet.

257
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,540
You really destroyed that bastard.

258
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,620
Did you not notice that you got a buff when you killed that
thing?

259
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,160
It's because of that passive ability.

260
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,240
Hover over to learn what it does.

261
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,020
You can also hover over your cat to learn what that buff
does, too.

262
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,040
Okay.

263
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,000
Here's a ram stat when you're down a unit.

264
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,420
Nice.

265
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,700
She's very self-assured.

266
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,680
There are also spells.

267
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,960
You only have one so far.

268
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,160
Unfortunately, you lack the mana to cast it.

269
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
It's how much mana the spell costs.

270
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,040
It's down.

271
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:31,440
good so far guys is how much mana you have you gain mana at
the end of your turn equal to your light bulb there's

272
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:40,340
nothing left to do so end your turn what about him oh i
guess it ends his turn is now mr bamboo's turn a little

273
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,800
quiet sound guy what's your opinion

274
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,680
do you agree with that dragon okay he has a range while
selecting where to move to you can see a preview of your

275
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:01,840
basic attack range in red moving range to tackle are as
close as you can get all right oh okay so like this is the

276
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:11,940
range of holy that's a big ass cat unfortunately you're
still not in range to attack the tom tom um however you do

277
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:21,320
have it if he the sound guy doesn't agree bad you have to
cast one of your spells take a look at roll here roll only

278
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:29,640
costs and you have five all right cool click roll and then
roll closer that thing all right there i'll roll here

279
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:37,940
because it's closer then you should already know how to do
that attack all right cool what did he do oh is that a

280
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:47,240
furball god fucking gross okay this is also why i like i i
have a dog instead of a cat i i have a fear of like when i

281
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,700
like a furballs it's like because dogs don't do Like, I
don't know, if I have a cat, and then, like, it just

282
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,380
randomly starts spitting furballs, and you just find it in
random places in your home.

283
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,480
That Tom Thomas pre-stick covers, so he'll take a few more
hits to kill it.

284
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,780
All right.

285
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,820
And turn.

286
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,680
Wait, can I?

287
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
Okay, I'll turn up the odd music.

288
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,360
Well, it's already up, by the way.

289
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,140
Yeah, but, like, dogs don't normally vomit.

290
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,140
Unless you, unless he ate something bad.

291
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,200
It's not a normal occurrence that you're going to...

292
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:30,340
to have yeah he just only has a crippling back problem but
that's fixable it just needs like ten thousand dollars but

293
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:46,580
it's it's fixable it's fixable purples are not fixable it's
a way of life okay it's gambus turning in you not enough

294
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:56,940
magic to cast your spell spit he also has allergy yes but
like that's just a way of life all right spit on him minus

295
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,000
one that was not good spitting you can cast spells as many
times per term as you want as long as you have the mana so

296
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:15,660
spit again make it real thick now all right do it again uh
good job at this it's just inconvenient The furball is very

297
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,520
inconvenient.

298
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,120
I trust that you can finish the rest of your fight on your
own.

299
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,260
So I'm going to hide in those bushes and judge you from
afar.

300
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,940
Good luck.

301
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,240
Alright.

302
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,740
We're making move a little closer.

303
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,500
And then be like, oh, I moved wrong.

304
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,580
Ooh, that's awkward.

305
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,380
Never mind.

306
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,780
Meow.

307
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,300
Alright.

308
00:22:42,300 --> 00:23:02,440
uh just use that yeah and then i'll roll away now oh he's
still coming after me meow meow all right keep spitting nice

309
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,280
all right get get a little closer and then smack that ass
yeah

310
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
She did it!

311
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,780
Beginner's luck.

312
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,020
Okay, now listen.

313
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,320
Each time you finish combat, one of your cats is going to
level up.

314
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
Check out old Mr. Bamboo.

315
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,640
He's about to get a whole lot better.

316
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,740
Let's just look at all these options.

317
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,620
Originally, I was going to let you choose yourself by
feeling you need to point something out.

318
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,760
There's a pretty awesome combo here.

319
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,860
Check out Mr. Bamboo's current pass effect.

320
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Okay.

321
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,480
Burn you inflict and... Oh, so I should get a burn.

322
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,600
So I should get Sunburn.

323
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,400
Right?

324
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,200
Now read what Sunburn does.

325
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:42,820
Okay.

326
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,300
Makes burn more So take sunburn already or not it's your
funeral, but then he can poop at it.

327
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,320
Wait, what do I do with poop though?

328
00:23:51,740 --> 00:24:00,880
I feel like I should get Sunburn but then he can also poop
you guys might not see it, but it says dump and he poops

329
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,260
there But I don't know what poop does, but fuck.

330
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,880
Okay, I'll trust him I'll trust this random thief.

331
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,920
He'll never lie to me Okay, but remember every cat is
different.

332
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,700
So always check out what your cat's passive ability does A
cat's passive can make or break or run And combos, wins,

333
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,140
games Always be on lookout for abilities that combo Alright,
how do I heal Mr. Burt?

334
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,160
Oh, sorry, Mr. Bamboo I wish I could rename my cats I really
do I need to be really, I could name the cats after you guys

Yay.

341
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,360
Mr. Bamboo points cleverly behind Butch, distracting him.

342
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,240
Well, hello, Mr. FastPass.

343
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,140

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,740
Yay!

353
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,900
What does the stick do?

354
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,060
A minute attack.

355
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,380
Oh.

356
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,880
Okay, yeah, I think.

357
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,460
Oh my god.

358
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,500
Dean 7 mine.

359
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,040
Oh, okay.

360
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,020
We don't need to use that.

361
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,160
Hold up.

362
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,680
You don't want to go to this boss fight.

363
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm prepared.

364
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,860
You have items that you're not yet equipped to catch.

365
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,140
Click here to equip them first.

366
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,300
I gave them a stick.

367
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,360
I mean, I guess I'll give him mana.

368
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,500
Give him some little cat nip.

369
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,840
It won't hurt anybody.

370
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,100
Just a small dose.

371
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,460
You know?

372
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm like, you know, just a little micro dosing for the cat.

373
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,920
Alright, pebbles!

374
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,040
Holy shit!

375
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,540
Back, back!

376
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,600
Alright, is the sound a lot better now?

377
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,840
It's time, yeah, just a small hit, you know?

378
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,660
And then, like, if they take breaks in between, then, like,
they'll never get addicted.

379
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,080
Never get hooked.

380
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,440
I train pebbles here myself.

381
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,000
He's about to rock your world.

382
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,220
Show me what you got.

383
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,840
Oh, awesome.

384
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,740
One last tip before I leave it up to you.

385
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
Attack from behind to do more damage.

386
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,140
Oh, I did that.

387
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,500
Oh, my God.

388
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,880
Oh, my God.

389
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,080
Oh, my God.

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:50,540
Pebbles.

391
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,060
Pebbles is a little scary.

392
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,260
Not gonna lie.

393
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,000
Pebbles is a little scary, guys.

394
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,280
Okay.

395
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,040
Oh, no.

396
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,180
Oh, me out.

397
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,960
Oh, this is bad.

398
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,300
Okay, we'll grab the cat in the back.

399
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,860
before he fucking dies.

400
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,600
And then...

401
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,800
That foot!

402
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,000
Alright, and then we roll away.

403
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,780
And he rolled away.

404
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,840
Meow, meow.

405
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,040
And he rolled away.

406
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,420
Meow, meow.

407
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,680
Okay.

408
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,380
Hey, so you might have noticed this already, but take a look
up here.

409
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,400
This is the order you and your enemies take their turns.

410
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,840
Okay.

411
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,900
The turn order is usually the same every round, so pay
attention to it.

412
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,660
Or don't.

413
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,940
Cat fight, cat.

414
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Why are you still?

415
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay, it's fine.

416
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,280
All right, okay, that's fine.

417
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,120
Meow.

418
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,320
I was gonna say, why the fuck are you still, like, there?

419
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,260
Wait.

420
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,560
Um.

421
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,480
Cat fight, cat fight.

422
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,620
Cat fight.

423
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,060
That's it.

424
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,220
I'm going to go next to you.

425
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,020
Poke.

426
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,900
Stick.

427
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:09,960
Bam.

428
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,920
And I'll keep spinning.

429
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,020
And then I'll spit again!

430
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
And then I'll spit...

431
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,560
Oh, I can't spit.

432
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,320
Oh, I...

433
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,700
I...

434
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,120
I...

435
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,680
I...

436
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,100
I...

437
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,180
I...

438
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,220
I...

439
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,360
Oh, no.

440
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,680
Okay, it's fine.

441
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,860
Oh, he is not fine.

442
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,820
Oh, no.

443
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,160
Okay, I can still sunburn him.

444
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,580
Get sunburned!

445
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,200
And then...

446
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,880
Move here.

447
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,740
And then...

448
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,180
Oh, my God.

449
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,120
I'm still too far.

450
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,260
Okay, I'll roll...

451
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,760
Here.

452
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:41,940
Okay.

453
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,880
There.

454
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,100
Alright.

455
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,220
Mr. Bamboo might be fucked, guys.

456
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,120
Mr. Bamboo does not look very healthy.

457
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,940
I think Mr. Bamboo might die.

458
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,960
There's a chance.

459
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,320
Oh, unless...

460
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,720
Oh, my God.

461
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,120
There you go.

462
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,560
It's okay.

463
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,800
Mr. Bamboo, you're fine.

464
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,040
You're so healthy.

465
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,820
Cat foot.

466
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,260
Cat.

467
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,620
Cat's foot.

468
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,120
Alright.

469
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,140
There you go.

470
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Sick!

471
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,480
Oh, if I spit on him, it'll get rid of the... It's fine.

472
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,860
Alright, one.

473
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,260
One hit.

474
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,200
And then...

475
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,500
Mr. Bamboo, please.

476
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,480
You can do this.

477
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,320
Just take... Just take one more hit.

478
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,120
Just take...

479
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Oh!

480
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,700
Oh!

481
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,300
Well, damn.

482
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,680
It looks like...

483
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,760
Okay, nobody's living that.

484
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:41,940
Look.

485
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,380
Gotta hit three.

486
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,840
It's okay.

487
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,440
Just a little.

488
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,400
He's twitching.

489
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,260
He's alive.

490
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:48,740
My cat.

491
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,680
And if they get injured and one of their stats get reduced
permanently.

492
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,380
Don't let their body hit too many times.

493
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,540
Or they will actually die.

494
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:54,860
It's okay.

495
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,540
He's twitching.

496
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,920
He's still alive.

497
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,220
He's just... He's you know.

498
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,260
He's...

499
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,120
He's not the same as he was before.

500
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,640
You know.

501
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Sometimes he stands there for like 20 seconds longer than he
should.

502
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:20,800
But... And he's forgot he doesn't know what two plus two is

00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,310
Thank you.

520
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,010
I hope...

521
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,990
Oh, my God.

522
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,790
Let's head to that house on my good friend, Mr. Bamboo.

523
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:13,270
He wasn't the same since he took a boulder on his head, but
he's still my best friend.

524
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,630
It's me, Mr. Tinkles.

525
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,690
You know that I heard about me around town.

526
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,850
Yes, and all the rumors are true.

527
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,150
I spread them myself.

528
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,610
Just like my legs.

529
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,990
Oh, Mr. Tinkles.

530
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,610
What?

531
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,730
This is so 2010 humor.

532
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,250
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,550
You can tell this was written around 2010 to 2015.

534
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,650
God, I'm so bad.

535
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,470
Anyway, you can call me Tink.

536
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,150
My God, look at this.

537
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:52,030
these kittens they just returned home from an adventure and
they look busted cats that have already been on adventure

538
00:32:52,030 --> 00:33:01,010
are retired that means they won't be going on any more
adventures oh so after each run my cats just they're one and

539
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:12,170
done that's it so why don't you take these guys inside so
did you just retire i mean that's the life i didn't realize

540
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,750
I didn't realize.

541
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,310
Mr. Bamboo still has a couple of lives in him.

542
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,170
Look at him.

543
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,010
I mean, don't look at him too hard.

544
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:26,670
But I feel like they still have a couple of runs in them.

545
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,650
They're one.

546
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,190
One pumping done.

547
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,350
Well, they seem pretty comfortable, I guess.

548
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,370
Stop shaking him.

549
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,530
So you can...

550
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,290
He's brain damaged, not physically impaired.

551
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,090

even use it.

572
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,340
Okay, they can melee and ship with a unit.

573
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,680
Okay, they're both smart cats.

574
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,860

575
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,740
Where's the water?

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,700
Oh, will they just level up tomorrow?

578
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,420
I was testing out the theory.

598
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,420
Stop, they are not getting hurt, guys.

599
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,540

Open up.

00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,500
It's science.

606
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,920
That's what he said.

607
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,000
I'm just I'm just conducting science.

608
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:55,060
It's the love of the game First thing those cats make babies
and become astronauts with the centrifuge training Someone

609

it's eugenics it's okay sorry it's mugenics that's the whole

614
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,700
premise of mugenics it's selective breeding

615
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
Okay, that's good.

616
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,760
I was like, that destroys the whole point of eugenics if I
can't select the people they breed with.

617
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,080
The night was calm.

618
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,080

It's locked for me.

880
00:56:59,130 --> 00:56:59,490
No!

881
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,390
That's my tank.

882
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:05,250
Why are they all so clumsy?

883
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,630
You're doing so much better than the few people I watch.

I mean, of course I know what I'm doing, guys.

892
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:20,330

I'll grab this money.

900
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,690
Is that a child?

901
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,420
Alright, nice.

902
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,320

903
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,660
That was a child.

904
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,520
Alright, roll over here.

905
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,100
We hop here.

906
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,680
And then we can't smack it.

907
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,740
We'll just look at it.

908
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,940
And turn.

909
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,460

Holy shit.

912
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,420
That could have given me rabies.

913
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,880
I was just gonna lob it here.

914
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,420
That's like, Sianara, right?

915
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,700
Oh, shit.

916
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:20,780
Wait.

00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,540
No, my broken leg!

918
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,920
Okay, it's dead.

919
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,520
It's dead.

920
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,400
Okay, that's good.

921
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,840
That's good.

922
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,600
It's dead, though.

923
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,660

924
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,000

00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,240
And I'll goad him over.

926
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:40,720
Meow, meow.

927
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,400

928
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,440
Get over here.

929
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,460

930
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,960

00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,200
Alright.

00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:58,370
Uh.

934
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,970
Holy shit.

935
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,330
Okay, that does too much.

936
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:03,990
Meow.

937
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:08,390
I'll just walk over here.

938
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,530
Okay, he's still alive.

939
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,420
I mean, I can literally just heat it up.

940
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,600
Yeah, I'm gonna say.

941
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,840
Alright, that's okay.

00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,360
Alright, he's now level two.

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:31,700
Gore!

946
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,280

hit towards your original tile.

947
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,220
Rock toss.

948

00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,000

01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:13,770
Okay, it's fine.

01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,010
Okay, it was the fire

01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,430
Okay, okay This is a sacrifice.

1053
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:23,850
Wait, how much is HP?

1060
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:43,210
Hut!

1061
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:45,490
And paw!

1062
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:49,230
Well, what's that over there?

1063
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:52,010
Meet me up.

1064
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:52,650
Oh, wait.

1065
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,530
Let's hop over there.

1066
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,110
It's catnip.

1067
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,210
Let's go.

1068
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:57,710
And then leap.

1069
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:58,430
Oh, wait.

1070
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:59,290
I can't leap this.

1071
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:01,130
Oh, wait.

1072
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:01,890
Leap!

1073
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:02,930
Boom!

1074
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:03,210
Oh.

1075
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,970
Alright, that's fine.

1076
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,290
He's okay.

1077
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:12,630
Meow.

1078
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:13,770
Meow.

1079
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:13,890
Yay!

1080
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,410
We did it!

1081
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,570
Oh, that's so easy.

1082
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:23,390
Meow.

1083
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:33,930
all right your spell costs three mana cast but each cat can
be cast only once per turn over power excess damage you deal

1084
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:41,370
to units makes them explode dealing next to the units around
except for you plus one race for each enemy your basic tacit

did pretty good with acid raid as my first run with how fuck

1087
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:08,030
that RNG was on the first run and I still made it home.

1088
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,150
Oh, I can now go to the sewers.

1089
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:12,810
I survived.

1090
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:15,570
Good job, my little cat.

1091
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:16,910
Oh, shit, sorry.

1092
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:18,250
There you go.

1093
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,070
Go celebrate.

1094
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,570
You all deserve it.

Yay!

1099
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:32,850
Wait.

1100
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,450
Oh, Mr. Bamboo and made another cat.

1101
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:38,810
Oh, shit.

1102
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:40,090
Oh.

1103
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,950
I wasn't but care.

1104
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:46,090
Oh, no.

1105
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,870
She said no.

1106
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,770
She said...

1107
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,810
He's like, no.

1108
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,270
I did not.

1109
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,910
She wants a real man.

1110
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,430
Oh, it's raining again.

1111
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:01,610
Got friends.

1112
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,050
Rain is a spooky one.

1113
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,210
I think it rains because we did bad things.

1114
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,330
The Rain Man sees what we'd be doing, and he tells on us.

1115
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:15,970
We are Frank, and we live under your house.

1116
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:20,170
Don't keep beating the allegations.

1117
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,930
Damn, first run, done.

1118
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,090
I don't think of the super chat.

1119
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,110
Thank you, thank you.

1120
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:32,630

sometimes we like being itchy because being itchy makes us

1121
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:43,090

1123
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,800

no more.

1124
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,660
No, Frank wants friends.

1125
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,940
Cat friends!

1126
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,040
See that pipe over there?

1127
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,340
That pipe goes all over the place.

1128
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,680
You want to send a kitty up?

1129
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,140
Push him down the pipe and bam, there he goes.

1130
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,420
We don't want just any kitty though.

1131
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,700
Frank wants retired cats only.

1132
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:17,400
Frank thinks we like retired cats because we are kind of
retired too.

1133
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,400
Okay, well, we go night nine.

1134
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:20,260
Alright.

1135
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,560
We have Amanda.

1136
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,740
Alright, Amanda.

1137
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,660
What do you have?

1138
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:26,980
Alright.

1139
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,840
Well, let's put Mr. Bam.

1140
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,440
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Bamboo.

1141
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,000
We lived a good life.

1142
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,140
Everybody say goodbye to Mr. Bamboo, guys.

1143
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,960
Say goodbye to Mr. Bamboo.

1144
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,820
He lived a good life.

1145
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,700
Don't worry, his wife can find a new boyfriend.

1146
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,520
I believe.

1147
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,140
Goodbye, Mr. Bamboo.

1148
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,080
An attic.

1149
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,000
Oh, I get an attic.

1150
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,020
Mr. Bamboo, for what?

1151
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,440
other male cats.

1152
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,780
was just waiting for you down here.

1153
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,480
Good job on sending cat to us.

1154
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,780
He's slow so when he runs, we can still get him.

1155
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,500
Frank's slow, but no one seems to get us.

1156
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:10,860
Cough, cough.

1157
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,240
Frank's getting so itchy.

1158
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,640
I think we're ready to build.

1159
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,120
You know how it's on top of your house?

1160
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,240
The one to point on it?

1161
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,540
Well, Frank's going to be building all over that one.

1162
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,080
You just wait and see.

1163
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,640
It won't crush you or nothing.

1164
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:25,220
Alright.

1165
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:27,680
What is this another tip.

1166
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,680
I hear mom say about Frank.

1167
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,400
Frank's scabby is just the tip of the iceberg.

1168
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:33,360
We miss her.

1169
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:37,060
Sometimes we look at the stars and talk at her in our
brains.

1170
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,760
I wish she could come back.

1171
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:39,320
Okay.

1172
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:41,980
Who's Butch?

1173
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,320
Oh, that's the thief.

1174
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,780
So check this out.

1175
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,000
I got a new caller for you.

1176
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,180
This class is called the cleric.

1177
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,360
Pretty hoity-toity religious type.

1178
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,180
Oh, this is my healer.

1179
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:05,200
cleric on your team ain't no one going down and if someone
does just pray on it okay you realize taking the hard path

1180
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:11,560
down gives you better items but also levels your cat up more
every battle loves a cat and the hard paths all feature an

1181
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:17,620
extra fight that's three more levels you could be gaining
take all three hard paths you don't always need to take the

1182
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:22,960
hard path especially if you're getting trash but you know
what they said no risk no rewards okay i was not taking the

1183
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,100
hard path um when it was acid rain Oh, there's Tink.

1184
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:30,580
Well, someone's need of a makeover.

1185
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,380
Let's chat.

1186
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,620
Yeah, I don't think we would.

1187
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,700
That's where I need to put it.

1188
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:35,620
Get a healer cat.

1189
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,040
I'm trying to remember which.

1190
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,660
Oh, I think the archer cat was pretty useless.

1191
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,640
Poops and dead cats actually lower your comfort.

1192
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,080
And it's also just really freaking gross.

1193
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,820
Watch yourself, girl.

1194
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,940
What about another tip?

1195
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,700
Oh, my God.

1196
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,840
Just notice the shirt he's wearing.

1197
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,180
Hold on.

1198
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:56,980
Wait, let me.

1199
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,060
I mean, I don't know.

1200
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,500
For those who haven't watched people play this game yet.

1201
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,180
Appeal makes your house, well, more appealing, I guess.

1202
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,700
The higher appeal, the better strays are that appear each
day.

1203
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:12,980
Don't sleep on appeal.

1204
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,260
How do I get appeal, though?

1205
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,260
Cat lady, and it's a terrible title for this song, which is
otherwise very...

1206
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:19,580
Alright.

1207
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,720
Um, I guess we...

1208
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,860
Well, we technically...

1209
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,280
Oh, we don't have enough cats.

1210
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,660
We only have this cat.

1211
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,060
All right, end day.

1212
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,180
We need four cats.

1213
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,740
Oh, with furniture?

1214

01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,860
Zaris doesn't want...

1216
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,680
Oh, my God.

1217
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,540
Oh, it's because of his broken rib?

1218
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,060
Why won't my cat bang?

1219
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:43,860
Oh, no!

1220
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:45,620
No!

1221
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,420
Just because she lost her husband!

1222
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,140
She was like, I can be the alpha cat now.

1223
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,020
One that was worded plus one archery.

1224
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:56,740

1227
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,080
Wait, they want to talk.

1228
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,400
Oh, and mine is luck.

1229
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,080
What does Butch want?

1230
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:35,680
So it looks like that sewer monster man built you a pipe,
huh?

1231
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
But don't feel special.

1232
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:37,920
I got one, too.

1233
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,840
How about you and I go into this?

1234
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,860
You send me cats with combat experience, and I let you kiss
me behind a dumb...

1235
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,520
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, bro.

1236
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,340
I'm sorry, bro.

1237
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,620
I'm gonna have to say no on that.

1238
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,660
I'm sorry, bro.

1239
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,420
We're, like, in that type of...

1240
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,060
Our friendship is not that high yet, bro.

1241
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,300
And, you know, you know, they say kiss your homies
goodnight.

1242
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,660
But, like, bro, we ain't homies, man.

1243
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,380
I just met you.

1244
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,520
Yeah, well, but I spanned that litter box of yours.

1245
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,920
Talk about that box by your house, sicko.

1246
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,980
I can upgrade that old shoe box.

1247
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,380
That way you can hold more sharp objects.

1248
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,720
Trust me, it's worth it.

1249
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:19,320
Just send me a cat who's killed some stuff and I'll hook you
up.

1250
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,380
All right, what does Tink want?

1251
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,640
Well, hello there.

1252
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,120
You're the talk of the town these days.

1253
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:35,200
Everyone's all like, there goes that so-and-so, aren't they
a catch?

1254
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,060
They got brains and buns.

1255
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,760
And I'm like, thanks, girl.

1256
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,460
But did you hear about the Nubian town who's been hoarding
all those cats?

1257
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:49,180
And then they're all like, yeah, yeah, heard about them.

1258
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,500
But what's this I hear about that book deal you landed.

1259
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:58,540

01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:00,420

Anyway.

1264
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,460
You know, I can, like, hear you talking your sleeve through
that thing, right?

1265
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:16,920
You old perv.

1266
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,980
My wife made me cover the pipe with a quilt.

1267
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,040

Maybe I'm actually send Gambo over.

1287
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:29,140
Only because, like, she was the first cat, but her stats are
pretty shit.

1288
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,600
Send the fighter?

1289
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,180
They want anyone that's had fighting experience.

1290
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,900
I feel like Chando has clutched a lot.

1291
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,600
I'm gonna send...

1292
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,420
Let's see.

1293
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,280
Everyone else has pretty decent stats.

1294
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,520
I'm gonna send Gambo out.

1295
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,200
She has decent base stats.

1296
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:50,620
Really?

1297
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,940
I feel like her base stats was, like, Like, pretty alright.

1298
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:59,960
And, like, Kara was, like, a really good mage.

1299
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,560
I'm going to send Gamble over.

1300
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:05,720
Goodbye, Gamble.

1301
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,880
The first cats I got.

1302
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:13,550
She's, like, getting old, too.

1303
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,710
She got to retire.

1304
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,230
Hey, that cat you sent me could really take a punch.

1305
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:30,310
So, um, as per our agreement, I'll upgrade that storage box
of yours.

1306
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,170
So pretty tiny, Odyssey.

1307
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:34,850
I got bigger ones, but they will cost you.

1308
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,850
Send more cats with fighting space, and I'll expand it more.

1309
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,690
This time, though, I want cats that ventured further from
home.

1310
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,410
Go any adventures in sewers or junkyard this time.

1311
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,330

01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,640
It's random.

1379
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,160
Well, archery.

1380
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:54,720
But actually, those are great at keeping your team alive.

1381
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,320
Helping them recover from taking hits.

1382
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,680
We should have one.

1383
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,840
We should give this to one now.

1384
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:01,700
There we go.

1385
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,380
We'll give it to this.

1386
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,100
Alright.

1387
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,600
And then you.

1388
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,440
We do need a tank.

1389
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,480
And then.

1390
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,080
Plus two.

1391
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:24,200
God.

1392
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,120
Mage was so good though.

1393
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:30,960
Uh.

1394
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,900
What do I get rid?

1395
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:33,460
Uh.

1396
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,000
Maybe.

1397
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,600
Plus two charisma.

1398
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:37,480
Meow.

1399
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,500
Maybe I give mage instead of archery.

1400
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:43,840
I didn't like...

1401
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,160
I didn't really like archery.

1402
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,920
Hunter over a mage?

1403
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:49,100
Yeah.

1404
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,320
Really?

1405
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,040
I had more luck with mage than I did with hunter.

1406
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,420
Is hunter better?

1407
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:03,380
Alright.

1408
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,840
Alright, we'll try.

1409
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,280
Oh, I got a bow.

1410
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,120
It's fancy.

1411
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,800
Let's see.

1412
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:10,960
We should give...

1413
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:28,310
the fighter this and then let's see he does look like a mage
though and we'll give the tank bow

1414
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:42,650
now inflicts my basic attack look at that and he could be
really he can be a fancy cat yeah there's more than one way

1415
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:46,230

01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,410
Yeah, I don't have a bow yet.

1418
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:54,910
I didn't see a bow anywhere.

1419
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,130
Alright, let's go in.

1420
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,210

1421
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:03,050
Mangy.

1422
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:03,970

1423
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,510

1698
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:05,130

1733
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:28,280
But who will heal me?

1734
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,300

01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:17,600
All right.

1762
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:21,420
Holy shit, okay.

1763
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,240
Okay, that's unfortunate.

1764
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:27,920
I'm gonna move here.

1765
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,420

1770
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:43,200

1771
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,400
Okay.

1775
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,660
Eatings all stats up.

01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,640
Oh, when I kill something, yeah, she's not killing anything.

1778
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,720
All she can do is heal.

1779
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:58,620
When you're down for the first time, each battle takes no
injury.

1780
01:50:58,780 --> 01:50:59,040
Revive.

1781
01:50:59,120 --> 01:50:59,400
Oh!

1782
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,380
And battle with 1 HP, gain plus 1.

1783
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:04,940
When you're down, all allies gain all stats up.

1784
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,080
I feel like...

1785
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:06,560
Eternal.

1786
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:10,900
I can go to the sewers.

1787
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,940
Wait, if I go to the sewers, do I continue my adventure?

1788
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,410
Oh my god, is it worth it?

1789
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:23,650
Guys, is it worth it?

1790
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:27,250
It is raining.

1791
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,830
Oh my god, not the zombie.

1792
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:30,790
Is it worth it, guys?

1793
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:33,010

1798
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,660
Alright, the sewers we go.

1799
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,640
Okay, maybe a large catnip.

1800
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,240
Gain plus five for the rest of the battle.

1801
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,220
That creates a creep puddle.

1802
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,920

1803
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:03,260

1809
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:15,660

Toad style.

1854
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:31,050

01:57:09,370 --> 01:57:10,370
That's actually pretty good.

1910
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:12,630
And then...

1911
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:14,170
I'll grab this.

1912
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:15,050
Alright.

1913
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:18,630

That's fine.

1916
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:22,110
I ate the poop.

1917
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:23,390
And then...

1918
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:25,330
I have to go to her.

1919
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:26,510
Very slowly.

1920
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,970
But I can wash the bruise off right now.

1921
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:33,870
Oh, wait.

1922
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:34,830

That's good.

1924
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:37,190

01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:53,630
Oh, this is bad.

1933
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:55,490
I actually should not be here.

1934
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:57,690
And then...

1935
01:57:57,690 --> 01:57:58,230

1941
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:35,530
It's fine.

1942
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:36,310
I can mark this.

1943
01:58:37,970 --> 01:58:39,290

And...

1947
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:50,090
I'll just wait here.

1948
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:50,690
I'll just chill here.

1949
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,550

And I'll enter.

1953
01:58:58,330 --> 01:58:58,750
Meow.

1954
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:00,750
Oh, yeah.

1955
01:59:01,870 --> 01:59:03,350
Now beat him up here.

1956
01:59:04,290 --> 01:59:06,470
And then, how much HP does he have left?

1957
01:59:07,130 --> 01:59:08,110
Now jump away.

1958
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:09,990
Jump.

1959
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:12,850

1960
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:15,930
Oh, I can't belly flop on that.

1961
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:18,890
Can I hit my own teammate?

1962
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:19,390
I wonder.

1963
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:22,150
Okay.

1964
01:59:23,170 --> 01:59:24,190

01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:28,950
Oh, I'm too scared to like...

1966
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:31,870

01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:54,570
Yeah, it wasn't too bad.

1979
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:56,150
I got a little worried for nothing.

1980
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,030

02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:45,800
Um, never mind.

2092
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:47,920
Now he's dead.

2093
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:51,660
Yay!

2094
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:55,460
All right.

2095
02:06:57,740 --> 02:07:05,620
Plus luck affects base, crit and not effects melee attacks,
speed, affects max health, and post combat.

2096
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:06,480
Oh, wait.

2097
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:07,520
That is.

2098
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:13,140
I feel like three or four because she's bad at, she doesn't
have speed.

2099
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:24,100
Speed or uh plus two or full heal speed or strength speed
all right speed

2100
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:29,470

Luck?

2106
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:01,940
Effects, base, crit chance and all.

2107
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:04,620
Should I do strength or...

2108
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:06,120
Or luck?

2109
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:07,180
Not archery.

2110
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:08,380
I don't think archery matters.

2111
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:14,800
Alright, one.

2112
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,480

Oh, yeah, no.

2114
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:22,580

2122
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:32,440
I'm just gonna punch the shit, I guess.

2123
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,080
And I'll end turn.

2124
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:42,660
What the fuck is going on?

2125
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,300
Oh my god, tower defense is actually so strong.

2126
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:47,980
What the fuck?

2127
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:50,140
Oh my god, he didn't hit me.

2128
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:51,340
That was close.

2129
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:55,500
Okay.

2130
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:58,640
I mean, I could, like, beat him up already.

2131
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:06,800
And then we'll go berserker mode.

2132
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,040

02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:20,040
And then I have to heal you because you're fucked up right

2137
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:21,760
And I gotta cleanse you.

2138
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,860

Oh, no!

2222
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:43,260
She can't save them.

2223
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:46,800
Oh, this is so bad.

2224
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,020
I'm just gonna stay here.

2225
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:48,740

02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:12,020

2230
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:13,760
I can...

2231
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:15,180
I can life steal.

2232
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:17,680
And then...

2233
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:18,800
We'll beat him up.

2234
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:22,920
It's okay.

2235
02:17:28,790 --> 02:17:30,150
We'll go here.

2236
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:32,210
And then...

2237
02:17:32,970 --> 02:17:33,550
We're gonna heal.

2238
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:35,970
And then...

2239
02:17:35,970 --> 02:17:36,550
Meow.

2240
02:17:37,010 --> 02:17:37,590
Meow.

2241
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:38,970
Meow.

2242
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:42,350
And then we'll wait.

2243
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:43,790
We will wait.

2244
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:44,390
Yeah!

2245
02:17:50,910 --> 02:17:51,670
Meow!

2246
02:17:53,370 --> 02:17:55,150
We stayed alive.

2247
02:17:55,550 --> 02:17:56,430
We did it.

2248
02:17:58,030 --> 02:17:58,370
Okay.

2249
02:17:58,730 --> 02:18:01,510
You might have a broken rib, but we made it.

2250
02:18:01,970 --> 02:18:03,410
No, my archer!

2251
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:04,770
My archer!

2252
02:18:07,790 --> 02:18:09,190
See, cost two.

2253
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:13,050
That's fucking me out.

2254
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:18,340
You want that mana region?

2255
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:19,620
For her?

2256
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:22,820
What do I want this for?

2257
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:29,880
Yeah, the archer lived, but he took a mana stat, though.

2258
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,700
Oh, it's good for...

2259
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:35,100
Okay, I'll get the mana region.

2260
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:36,700
Well, we get to go home now.

2261
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:37,720
He made it.

2262
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:39,980
She made it home.

2263
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:42,220
We made it home, guys.

2264
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:46,780
I could see our house from here.

2265
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:48,580
Run done.

2266
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:51,080
Now we have the caves.

2267
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:52,840
I mean, we're doing pretty well.

2268
02:18:53,940 --> 02:18:55,600
I don't even know if I'm doing well or not.

2269
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:57,120
I feel like I'm doing well.

2270
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,540
This is my second run.

2271
02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:13,250
See, guys?

2272
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:17,230
People doubted me in tactical roguelikes.

2273
02:19:17,730 --> 02:19:18,830
Because I have to think.

2274
02:19:20,110 --> 02:19:22,670
I've secretly hidden my power level.

2275
02:19:25,890 --> 02:19:27,470
Holy shit, that's a lot of stuff.

2276
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:28,990
Trash.

2277
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:30,550
What do I not want?

2278
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:33,670
I want this.

2279
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:37,930
Team plus.

2280
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:40,530
Brought one.

2281
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:43,190
Me, if they give up five, get the ships, they can thank you.

2282
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:47,250
I told you, I was only acting.

2283
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:49,170
I was only pretending to be dumb.

2284
02:19:56,150 --> 02:19:57,330
Let's see it.

2285
02:19:57,470 --> 02:19:59,550
I don't know what else I don't need.

2286
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:01,910
It's worn.

2287
02:20:05,110 --> 02:20:06,510
Yeah, I'll grab this.

2288
02:20:06,810 --> 02:20:08,390
This is already about to break anyway.

2289
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:10,430
Keep talus?

2290
02:20:10,590 --> 02:20:12,270
I thought talus is bad.

2291
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:19,900
Give up on consumables?

2292
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:21,940
Which one should I give up on?

2293
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:22,620
Yeah.

2294
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:25,720

They were all men.

2301
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:06,420
I had no women in my army.

2302
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:10,340
Oh my god.

2303
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,580

02:24:13,330 --> 02:24:14,490

Wait, actually?

2346
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:16,810
Wait, she has born again, though.

2347
02:24:17,070 --> 02:24:19,770
By her constitution, fucking is ass.

2348
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:25,630
And new cat, Manequist?

2349
02:24:27,550 --> 02:24:34,990
Spanna coin has spawned a random pickup on a random tab
attacking adjacent Okay, but he did get born again though.

2350
02:24:35,510 --> 02:24:43,990
All right, let's let's get another one Warriors not yeah
nothing of none of you guys fought You have like almost no

2351
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:45,390
you might want to go on adventure to fight.

2352
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:54,070
Oh, no, I have too many cats Oh, no, I have too many cats
Oh, Tracy Oh, Tracy

2353
02:24:59,210 --> 02:25:01,050
Yeah, yeah, I see you.

2354
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:08,730
I'm Tracy, but I honestly don't feel a word can fully
represent who I am as a person, so don't bother using it.

2355
02:25:09,770 --> 02:25:12,110
So you must think you're some type of pet lover?

2356
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:16,010
I assume you identify as a pet lover, but how you carry
yourself.

2357
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:19,610
Well, yeah, I thought so pet lover.

2358
02:25:20,050 --> 02:25:22,570
God, that term is so specious.

2359
02:25:23,330 --> 02:25:26,770
Even hearing the word pet just make my skin crawl.

2360
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:28,410
I prefer the term.

2361
02:25:28,590 --> 02:25:30,230
animal companion.

2362
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:34,350
But personally, I'm going to step beyond loving animals.

2363
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:39,730
In fact, I believe all animals should have the same rights
as us.

2364
02:25:40,770 --> 02:25:42,150
If not more.

2365
02:25:43,230 --> 02:25:49,370
Even the term pet showcased a bigoted species agenda that
this sick world subscribed to.

2366
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:51,230
And I had my way.

2367
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:54,110
Using that word would be punishable by death.

2368
02:25:54,370 --> 02:25:56,130
She looks like she uses Tumblr.

2369
02:25:59,410 --> 02:26:13,350

Is he doing it?

2376
02:27:05,810 --> 02:27:08,770
Oh no, I think Frank has no stamina.

2377
02:27:10,130 --> 02:27:11,010
Frank needs a nap.

2378
02:27:11,610 --> 02:27:12,370
Frank is me.

2379
02:27:13,230 --> 02:27:13,730
Alright.

2380
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:20,070
Okay, we might need another lady cat in there.

Alright, you two, you two might have to go.

02:28:03,550 --> 02:28:04,750
Are you fucking kidding me?

2408

02:29:31,150 --> 02:29:31,590
Okay, it's okay.

2439
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:32,990
They're making babies.

2440
02:29:33,390 --> 02:29:33,790
No!

2441
02:29:35,130 --> 02:29:36,170
There were no winners.

2442
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:36,730
That's fine.

2443
02:29:37,350 --> 02:29:37,990
Oh, my God.

2444
02:29:38,290 --> 02:29:39,410
Okay, I...

2445
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:40,410
Okay, give me a sec.

2447
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:44,650
I thought I had enough food.

2448
02:29:44,770 --> 02:29:45,950
I forgot how many cats I had.

2449
02:29:46,150 --> 02:29:47,350
I lost track!

2450
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:49,530

2451
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:53,630
Okay.

2452
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:56,950
I lost track!

2453
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,570

2454
02:29:58,590 --> 02:29:59,930
18 cats?

2455
02:30:00,130 --> 02:30:01,690
Oh my god, there's too many cats.

2456
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:06,290
Oh my god, there's way too many cats, guys.

2457
02:30:07,070 --> 02:30:08,190
That's not enough.

2458

Okay, wait, I can buy more food.

2459
02:30:11,070 --> 02:30:12,890

Okay, we have strength.

2464
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:26,610
You can be the fighter.

2465
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:27,930
We need some cat.

2466
02:30:28,890 --> 02:30:30,610
Oh my god, too many cats.

2467
02:30:30,770 --> 02:30:32,810

2474
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:51,290
There's too many cats.

2475
02:30:51,390 --> 02:30:53,690
All right, all the retired cats, you go up here.

2476
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:56,890
I'm having trouble keeping track of all these cats.

2477
02:30:57,570 --> 02:30:57,850
Okay.

Alright, you go up here.

02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:24,890
There's too many.

2487
02:31:25,090 --> 02:31:26,190
I'm losing track.

2488
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:27,650

Okay, that should be...

2494
02:32:16,530 --> 02:32:18,210
We should have...

2495
02:32:18,930 --> 02:32:21,030

Wait, six archery.

2507
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:53,690
You already have good speed, though.

2508
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:56,630
Minus one constitution.

2509
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:01,750

02:36:08,190 --> 02:36:08,990
That's the thing.

2573
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:11,310
I don't have an item that gives me armor.

2574
02:36:20,460 --> 02:36:21,560
Are you most vulnerable?

2575
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,180
I guess the cleric, right?

2576
02:36:23,660 --> 02:36:25,100

I feel like...

2595
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:35,860
This cat's already like...

2596
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:36,780
He's too close.

2597
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:38,980
All right, we're gonna...

2598
02:37:38,980 --> 02:37:40,700
We're just gonna hammer these cats.

2599
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:41,620
Get out of here.

2600
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:42,820
Holy shit!

2601
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:48,320
Okay, we gotta hope that he doesn't go into this cat.

2602
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,160
Wow!

Yeah, lucky.

2606
02:38:03,640 --> 02:38:04,300
There we go.

2607
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:06,780
Enter.

Oh, my God.

2614
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:17,140
Does it call more cats?

2615
02:38:17,380 --> 02:38:17,840
Oh, no.

2616
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:19,340
I just don't worry.

2617
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:20,860
I got to eat my shit, though.

2618
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:22,460

Okay, that makes sense.

2637
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:05,940
I'll grab the coins.

2638
02:40:10,380 --> 02:40:12,000
And then we'll see how it goes.

2639
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:16,200

2645
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:29,840
Go, Flea!

2646
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:30,420
Go!

2647
02:40:30,980 --> 02:40:31,900
I can shoot another.

2648
02:40:31,980 --> 02:40:32,960
And another one!

2649
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:33,780
Get my coin!

2650
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:35,360
Oh, he doesn't pick up money.

2651
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:36,560
That's unlucky.

2652
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:38,400
Oh, goodbye, Flea.

2653
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:39,000
Goodbye.

2654
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,440
Goodbye.

2655
02:40:41,440 --> 02:40:41,900
Goodbye.

2656
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:44,080
Oh my god, I have so many minions.

2657
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:49,460
I missed my mobile tank, though.

2658
02:40:52,910 --> 02:40:54,270
He's not mobile at all.

2659
02:40:56,670 --> 02:40:58,010
There you go.

2660
02:41:01,250 --> 02:41:02,750
I gotta destroy this.

2661
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:07,470
Holy shit, how much?

2662
02:41:07,930 --> 02:41:10,790
How much HP does this trash bag have?

2663
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:12,630
I have to kill this cat.

2664
02:41:20,070 --> 02:41:21,530
I'm just gonna grab the money.

2665
02:41:21,670 --> 02:41:22,130
Fuck this.

2666
02:41:25,710 --> 02:41:26,850

2670
02:42:04,770 --> 02:42:07,170
I thank God I can actually move now.

2671
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:09,310
Okay, but I really do want to pick up this money.

2672
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:11,250
Okay, the other guy can pick it up for me.

2673
02:42:19,570 --> 02:42:20,210
There we go.

2674
02:42:20,830 --> 02:42:22,590
I was worried that he was going to hit him.

2675
02:42:25,590 --> 02:42:26,670
Alright, make a wish!

2676
02:42:28,730 --> 02:42:29,990
Keep making wishes!

2677
02:42:31,550 --> 02:42:32,550
Chuck another flee!

2678
02:42:36,450 --> 02:42:38,710
Okay, eventually they're going to head there.

2679
02:42:39,610 --> 02:42:43,090
Alright, now I'm going to grab the money and do more luck.

2680
02:42:43,370 --> 02:42:44,830
I'm just going to be more lucky.

2681
02:42:45,890 --> 02:42:46,990
I'm almost there.

2682
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:48,530
Yay!

2683
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:50,330
He exploded!

2684
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:51,850
Oh, he ran away.

2685
02:42:53,370 --> 02:42:54,150
That's right.

2686
02:42:54,310 --> 02:42:54,730
Run!

2687
02:42:56,970 --> 02:43:00,050
Alright, knock back, then dash forward and attack it.

2688
02:43:00,470 --> 02:43:01,390
Assert dominance.

2689
02:43:01,550 --> 02:43:04,910
If this, you become the Eviro Alpha, this spell deals five
additional.

2690

you become...

2694
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:46,260
If your alpha spell deals five additional damage, it
inflicts bruise.

2695
02:43:47,960 --> 02:43:49,320
Yeah, I feel like Ram will be useful.

2696
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:50,720
I'm gonna grab that.

2697
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:52,680

Wait, can I...

2700
02:43:59,780 --> 02:44:01,700
No, I feel like Rot was so OP.

2701
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:04,360
My casts are not as good.

2702
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:05,380
Pull out the knife.

2703
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:06,320
Let's fucking do it.

2704
02:44:06,860 --> 02:44:08,000
You're so strong.

2705
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:09,480
You're not so strong.

2706
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:09,840
No!

2707
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:13,960
You're bleeding!

2708
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,020
Oh, no!

2709
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:20,380
I don't have cleanse!

2710
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:22,500
This is bad.

2711
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:23,700
I actually don't have cleanse.

2712
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:27,620
Guys, this might be the first run that we're GGs.

2713
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,580
I don't have anything.

2714
02:44:37,460 --> 02:44:38,220
I'm not that.

2715
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:40,520
Apparently, I wasn't as strong as I thought.

2716
02:44:42,900 --> 02:44:45,420
I thought I was so strong.

2717
02:44:48,440 --> 02:44:48,760
Okay.

2718
02:44:50,060 --> 02:44:51,940
I am a little scared.

2719
02:44:55,160 --> 02:44:56,880
Okay, I'll go here and just start healing.

2720
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:58,560
Here, here's a lick.

2721
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:02,060
There you go.

2722
02:45:08,460 --> 02:45:11,020
I am a little scared here.

2723
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:15,200
hope that he doesn't come near me.

2724
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:18,740
Oh god.

2725
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:19,360
Okay, that's good.

2726
02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:19,760
That's good.

2727
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:20,320
Only her.

2728
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:23,980
Okay, he can only move one.

2729
02:45:24,560 --> 02:45:26,380
Tom Thomas, very weak.

2730
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:28,400
Mao.

2731
02:45:31,360 --> 02:45:34,020
I'll get rid of... I'm gonna get rid of you first.

2732
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:38,000
And then...

2733
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:38,980
I'll get rid of you.

2734
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:41,260
I'm gonna go Ram Yield!

2735
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:43,340
That's right!

2736
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:45,640
Get out of here.

2737
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:47,740
And I'm gonna go here, too.

2738
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,180
Oh, I definitely need a healer, though.

2739
02:45:55,310 --> 02:45:58,110
Eventually, I feel like I will make it across.

2740
02:46:00,570 --> 02:46:01,170
I...

2741
02:46:01,170 --> 02:46:01,710
Be lucky.

2742
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:02,290
Don't worry.

2743
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:03,130
I have luck.

2744
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:06,870
Okay, I'm gonna slowly walk over to...

2745
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:12,770
Okay, um...

2746
02:46:12,770 --> 02:46:13,270
Well...

2747
02:46:15,670 --> 02:46:17,370
I said slowly.

2748
02:46:17,870 --> 02:46:19,750
I just say slowly, guys.

2749
02:46:21,270 --> 02:46:23,030
We're going to shoot the fleet over here.

2750
02:46:24,370 --> 02:46:25,430
And then...

2751
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:27,790
Okay.

2752
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:29,230
And then lob it.

2753
02:46:30,270 --> 02:46:30,850
There we go.

2754
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:35,300
No!

2755
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:36,000
No!

2756
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:36,760
No!

2757
02:46:40,720 --> 02:46:41,140
Okay.

2758
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:42,020
Okay.

2759
02:46:44,710 --> 02:46:47,250
How did it jump to me?

2760
02:46:49,450 --> 02:46:51,810
That was so bullshit.

2761
02:46:53,710 --> 02:46:54,310
Okay.

2762
02:46:56,270 --> 02:46:57,450
Get out of here!

2763
02:46:58,490 --> 02:46:58,950
Fuck you.

2764
02:47:00,470 --> 02:47:00,730
Okay.

2765
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:04,090
Get this guy out of here.

2766
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:10,400
Well.

2767
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:15,280
All right, finally I'm here.

2768
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:16,460
That took so long.

2769
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:18,620
Finally here.

2770
02:47:19,140 --> 02:47:19,340
All right.

2771
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,640
Okay, I'm gonna heal.

2772
02:47:25,140 --> 02:47:26,100
Heal you.

2773
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:27,420
Lick.

2774
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:30,600
And then we're going to chill.

2775
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:35,100
More money.

2776
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:40,580
Alright.

2777
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:41,720
We're going to be here.

2778
02:47:42,580 --> 02:47:44,140
Then we're going to lob a flea over here.

2779
02:47:50,010 --> 02:47:50,790
That's fine.

2780
02:47:52,210 --> 02:47:52,450
Okay.

2781
02:47:52,450 --> 02:47:53,110
He's getting beat up.

2782
02:47:53,210 --> 02:47:53,850
But that's okay.

2783
02:47:54,010 --> 02:47:55,650
He's a tank for a reason, guys.

2784
02:47:56,210 --> 02:47:56,930
Oh my god.

2785
02:47:57,010 --> 02:47:57,750
And he's bleeding.

2786
02:47:58,170 --> 02:47:58,930
It's okay.

2787
02:47:59,110 --> 02:47:59,650
It's okay.

2788
02:47:59,670 --> 02:47:59,950

2798
02:48:43,030 --> 02:48:44,830
Is this permanent or no?

2799
02:48:45,030 --> 02:48:45,390
Chat.

2800
02:48:55,050 --> 02:48:55,850
No, that's where...

2801
02:48:55,850 --> 02:48:56,910
Okay, which is better?

2802
02:48:57,210 --> 02:48:57,750
Emergency?

2803
02:48:58,770 --> 02:49:01,030
I feel like it's not emergency or wish, right?

2804
02:49:01,450 --> 02:49:03,030
Oh, it's for the battle.

2805
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:07,740
Cure wounds?

2806
02:49:08,980 --> 02:49:10,140
Wish seems good.

2807
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:11,580
Yeah, heal.

2808
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:12,940
Oh, you sound strong.

2809
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:14,860
Okay.

2810
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:17,660
What do you wish?

2811
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:21,960
I'm not fan of my current cats.

2812
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:28,560
current cats are not as good as I like.

2813
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:31,520
I will have to say.

2814
02:49:35,780 --> 02:49:38,140
Oh, it heals enemies too?

2815
02:49:38,340 --> 02:49:38,780
Okay.

2816
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:41,440
That's a little unlucky.

2817
02:49:42,980 --> 02:49:43,200
Okay.

2818
02:49:43,220 --> 02:49:44,140
Pain's slow.

2819
02:49:44,700 --> 02:49:44,720
Okay.

2820
02:49:45,440 --> 02:49:45,820
All right.

2821
02:49:46,060 --> 02:49:47,440
That's where does it go?

2822
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:48,280
Does it go here?

2823
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:49,080
Oh, it goes here.

2824
02:49:49,180 --> 02:49:50,400
Yeah, we're not using that.

2825
02:49:52,660 --> 02:49:53,020
Okay.

2826
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:54,700
Examine.

2827
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:56,040
Or pick.

2828
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:57,780
Lit it's jar.

2831
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:02,800

2832
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:06,160

2833
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:09,520

All right, I have to do a little flip.

2840
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:47,180
I already forgot where the bear traps are, guys.

2841
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:49,640

Oh my god, all he keeps just running away.

02:57:13,240 --> 02:57:15,100
He keeps running away and throwing more traps.

02:58:25,990 --> 02:58:27,310
There's a trap here, isn't it?

2981
02:59:50,380 --> 02:59:51,200
Get out of here!

2982
02:59:51,220 --> 02:59:51,620
here.

2983
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,120
Okay.

2984
03:00:01,060 --> 03:00:01,860
What?

2985
03:00:02,180 --> 03:00:03,220
What HP?

2986
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:07,820
How?

2987
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:11,840
Oh my god.

2988
03:00:12,040 --> 03:00:13,100
I can't even get to him.

2989
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:16,180
I can't even get to him.

2990
03:00:17,240 --> 03:00:19,100
There's a trap right here.

2991
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,180
There's...

2992
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:25,540
There's a trap right here.

2993
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:32,640
Okay, it's okay.

2994
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:42,980
All traps.

2995
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:44,900
It's just all traps.

2996
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:46,820
It's just...

2997
03:00:46,820 --> 03:00:48,600
It's just all traps.

2998
03:00:54,060 --> 03:00:54,860
Okay.

2999
03:00:56,540 --> 03:00:56,620
Okay.

3000
03:00:57,520 --> 03:00:59,900
I can't even ram into him.

3001
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:01,500
I can't...

3002
03:01:05,880 --> 03:01:07,240
Please shot!

3003
03:01:08,200 --> 03:01:08,300
Yeah!

3004
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:18,090
Oh, my God.

3005
03:01:20,830 --> 03:01:21,090
Alright.

3006
03:01:22,830 --> 03:01:24,470
An attack that hits all units.

3007
03:01:24,670 --> 03:01:26,090
Okay, we're gonna get Stakeout.

3008
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:26,970
I think Stakeout.

3009
03:01:27,070 --> 03:01:27,550
It's over.

3010
03:01:27,850 --> 03:01:29,330
It's actually over.

3011
03:01:30,010 --> 03:01:30,590
Is that...

3012
03:01:33,390 --> 03:01:35,150
It's actually over.

3013
03:01:36,970 --> 03:01:47,990

03:02:08,730 --> 03:02:10,950
These cats are actually not made for this.

3017
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:20,700
Alright.

3018
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:23,840
Oh, he ran like a little bitch.

3019
03:02:23,920 --> 03:02:24,300
Meow!

3020
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:29,160
Alright.

3021
03:02:29,780 --> 03:02:30,680
Let's grab this.

3022
03:02:31,460 --> 03:02:32,420
Let's get some luck in.

3023
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:38,000
And then I'm gonna go here and then wish ourselves to
full...

3024
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:41,600
I need to wish myself to full HP.

3025
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:42,440
right now.

3026
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:45,460
And then, we're gonna wait.

3027
03:02:50,610 --> 03:02:52,390
On your next turn, you're...

3028
03:02:53,770 --> 03:02:55,230
Lob shot.

3029
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:00,440
Uh...

3030
03:03:01,620 --> 03:03:02,800
Take care.

3031
03:03:05,820 --> 03:03:06,620
Nice.

3032
03:03:07,660 --> 03:03:09,060
And then we're gonna flee shot this.

3033
03:03:09,860 --> 03:03:10,340
Go, flee!

3034
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:10,800
Go!

3035
03:03:11,640 --> 03:03:12,640
I believe!

3036
03:03:13,320 --> 03:03:14,300
Alright, goodbye!

3037
03:03:16,560 --> 03:03:18,780
I- clearly I didn't believe hard enough.

3038
03:03:21,120 --> 03:03:21,580
Unfortunately.

3039
03:03:28,570 --> 03:03:29,030
Mow.

3040
03:03:32,570 --> 03:03:35,150
I'm going to focus on killing these cat.

3041
03:03:36,430 --> 03:03:36,990
Bye, cat.

3042
03:03:37,150 --> 03:03:37,770
That's right, run!

3043
03:03:41,930 --> 03:03:42,650
Well, I can't do any.

3044
03:03:42,730 --> 03:03:43,870
I should have just rammed it.

3045
03:03:47,110 --> 03:03:49,730
Alright, and then...

3046
03:03:50,350 --> 03:03:51,350
Let's beat this cat up.

3047
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:57,140
You know what?

3048
03:03:57,420 --> 03:03:58,760
Fuck it, let's go over here.

3049
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:02,380
I'm healed.

3050
03:04:09,810 --> 03:04:10,210
Wow.

3051
03:04:11,090 --> 03:04:12,210
He's full of HP, right?

3052
03:04:17,540 --> 03:04:18,580
We'll go here.

3053
03:04:19,820 --> 03:04:20,940
We'll flee shot him.

3054
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:23,780
And then we'll shoot another.

3055
03:04:24,480 --> 03:04:25,040
There we go.

3056
03:04:25,180 --> 03:04:25,900
There we go.

3057
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:26,860
That's why I like...

3058
03:04:26,860 --> 03:04:28,540
Oh, and then another flee shot.

3059
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:30,300
Double flee shot.

3060
03:04:31,280 --> 03:04:33,080
That's what I like to see!

3061
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:38,640
Alright.

3062
03:04:39,100 --> 03:04:39,400
Meow.

3063
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:41,500
Round three.

3064
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,400
Alright, let's just hit this cat.

3065
03:04:46,360 --> 03:04:49,080
And then grab his shit.

3066
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:50,780
And then steal his money.

3067
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:53,360
There we go.

3068
03:04:54,680 --> 03:04:56,920
Alright, I'm pretty sure all my fleas can kill him.

3069
03:04:57,180 --> 03:04:57,540
Yay!

3070
03:04:58,240 --> 03:04:59,480
Oh, shit, there's a maggot.

3071
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:00,620
What the fuck?

3072
03:05:01,940 --> 03:05:03,520
Oh, I did not see the maggot.

3073
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:05,400
all right we'll grab this then

3074
03:05:08,720 --> 03:05:18,640
all right the maggots should get closer this run might be
safe no i think it's hopeless i think this run is is ggs i

3075
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:31,160
really i do not believe in this run guys my my team this my
team is pretty fucking weak right now yeah when we fight

3076
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:36,160
bosses it's cooked The bosses are just too bad, too, too
strong.

3077
03:05:42,270 --> 03:05:45,870
But you need to spawn scrap to pick up or jump up them.

3078
03:05:45,970 --> 03:05:47,110
I feel like flip-flop.

3079
03:05:47,630 --> 03:05:48,370
The mobility.

3080
03:05:52,710 --> 03:05:53,670
No, the...

3081
03:05:53,670 --> 03:05:55,030
Oh, yeah, the...

3082
03:05:56,430 --> 03:05:57,890
I forgot about the gun.

3083
03:05:59,210 --> 03:06:02,230
Should I get flip-flop or a Fisher or throw a scrap?

3084
03:06:03,990 --> 03:06:05,230
No, I'm a cat, too.

3085
03:06:05,470 --> 03:06:06,890
They're all ugly, but...

3086
03:06:06,910 --> 03:06:08,670
But they're doing their job.

3087
03:06:08,790 --> 03:06:11,410
Not the best type of job, but they're doing it.

3088
03:06:14,590 --> 03:06:16,030
I feel like flip-flop, right?

3089
03:06:16,690 --> 03:06:17,450
Damage a lot.

3090
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:18,290
Is that a lot?

3091
03:06:18,370 --> 03:06:18,590
Yeah.

3092
03:06:20,230 --> 03:06:21,350
Good for your callus.

3093
03:06:22,690 --> 03:06:24,730
Yeah, but it's just for a hunter, though.

3094
03:06:27,770 --> 03:06:28,250
Uh.

3095
03:06:29,570 --> 03:06:33,150
Put all-you-know-why line towards the center of that line.

3096
03:06:33,330 --> 03:06:34,570
This has 10%.

3097

Right?

3103
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:12,610

I'm gonna give it to the...

3106
03:07:21,580 --> 03:07:23,640
Her tank is the one that's going up the most.

3107
03:07:28,520 --> 03:07:28,920
Alright.

3108
03:07:30,180 --> 03:07:31,060
Oh, fuck.

3109
03:07:32,320 --> 03:07:33,160
Doesn't matter.

3110
03:07:33,580 --> 03:07:34,360
Oh, my God.

3111
03:07:34,460 --> 03:07:34,960

Oh, no!

3113
03:07:41,880 --> 03:07:43,580
Some of their food in the chaos.

3114
03:07:43,940 --> 03:07:45,340
Mac has stored one food.

3115
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:48,160
Madigan!

3116
03:07:50,880 --> 03:07:51,920
It's okay.

3117
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:56,460
Madigan, how could you do this?

3118
03:07:56,920 --> 03:07:58,260
Oh, propeller hat!

3119
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:00,940

Wait.

3122
03:08:04,980 --> 03:08:05,760

Blocks incoming ignores tiles and can pass- Oh, yeah!

3124
03:08:10,660 --> 03:08:11,320
Wait, should it?

3125

Blocks incoming damage.

3126
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:15,540

Alright, I'm broke.

03:08:52,420 --> 03:08:54,880
I spent it all on the wishing well.

3132
03:08:56,180 --> 03:08:56,780

I'll put that.

3136
03:09:05,840 --> 03:09:09,060
If it's all stats up, then my strength will go up too.

03:09:11,840 --> 03:09:15,040
I'll put it here and then...

3138
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:17,180
It's time for a rat, man.

3190
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:44,180

03:14:51,820 --> 03:14:55,380
My cleric has been asleep the entire time.

3195
03:14:57,460 --> 03:14:59,160
Oh my god.

03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:02,500

03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:04,360
We're going home, cats.

3198
03:15:04,540 --> 03:15:05,600
We're going home.

3199
03:15:06,580 --> 03:15:06,960

I'll grab that.

3207
03:15:50,300 --> 03:15:54,100
Small bomb, conductor, brain candy.

03:15:54,400 --> 03:15:56,180
And now I'll throw everything else away.

3209
03:15:57,660 --> 03:16:00,640
For his neutral special, the cat pulled out a gun.

3210
03:16:03,780 --> 03:16:04,100
Alright.

3211
03:16:05,280 --> 03:16:06,580

You guys were all terrible.

03:16:40,220 --> 03:16:41,900
You guys were all terrible cats.

3220
03:16:43,560 --> 03:16:45,460
I might keep you because you have flea shot.

3221
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:47,700
You might, you get to bang.

3222
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:51,340
All right.

3223
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:52,440
The rest of you.

3224
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:53,540
The rest of you.

3225
03:16:53,700 --> 03:16:54,680
You're going out.

3226
03:16:54,840 --> 03:16:55,360
I'm sorry.

3227
03:16:56,100 --> 03:16:58,680
You guys were all, oh, Calus is not inheritable.

3228
03:16:59,240 --> 03:16:59,900
All right, goodbye.

3229
03:17:01,260 --> 03:17:03,020
No, but the flea shot, I will say.

3230
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:04,660
the flea shot was clutch.

3231
03:17:05,340 --> 03:17:06,700
I will keep the flea shot.

3232
03:17:08,560 --> 03:17:10,960
Everyone else, you're going to Frank.

3233
03:17:11,880 --> 03:17:12,280
Goodbye.

3234
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:15,320
All of you.

3235
03:17:16,420 --> 03:17:17,920
The flea shot saved the run.

3236
03:17:18,240 --> 03:17:19,520
The rest of you, you're out.

3237
03:17:21,980 --> 03:17:23,020
You're out.

3238
03:17:23,940 --> 03:17:26,240
All right, I gotta start weeding out some shitty cats.

3239
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:27,800
I have way too many cats.

3240
03:17:28,420 --> 03:17:29,720
The good cats are at the top.

3241
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:32,380
The bad, I'm gonna start weeding out the cats now.

3242
03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:34,480
Alright, you're going out.

3243
03:17:37,720 --> 03:17:39,060
I'm going to send you to Kmart.

3244
03:17:40,860 --> 03:17:41,160
Anya.

3245
03:17:41,280 --> 03:17:42,820
Anya, get rid of these cats.

3246
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:47,280
Alright.

3247
03:17:49,100 --> 03:17:49,520
Strength.

3248
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:51,300
Speed.

3249
03:17:51,620 --> 03:17:52,360
You're fine.

3250
03:17:53,180 --> 03:17:55,320
I have too many cats, guys.

3251
03:17:56,220 --> 03:17:58,200
There's actually too many cats.

3252
03:18:02,610 --> 03:18:03,230
Alright.

3253
03:18:03,850 --> 03:18:05,430
I don't know.

3254
03:18:05,450 --> 03:18:05,970
Oh, shit.

3255
03:18:06,350 --> 03:18:07,250
Cat is fucked.

3256
03:18:07,490 --> 03:18:08,090
Yeah, I know you're out.

3257
03:18:09,190 --> 03:18:11,410
Oh my god, no one wants you.

3258
03:18:11,910 --> 03:18:13,830
Oh my god, no one wants you.

3259
03:18:17,070 --> 03:18:19,230
Why does no one want this cat?

3260
03:18:22,330 --> 03:18:23,470
I can't even.

3261
03:18:24,110 --> 03:18:25,450
Oh my god, you're too old.

3262
03:18:25,670 --> 03:18:26,350
You're too young.

3263
03:18:27,730 --> 03:18:29,210
I actually have to keep you.

3264
03:18:31,950 --> 03:18:32,350
Meow.

3265
03:18:35,010 --> 03:18:36,330
I don't know who to get rid of.

3266
03:18:36,350 --> 03:18:37,010
rid of.

3267
03:18:42,370 --> 03:18:44,570
Oh my, all these cats are pretty neat.

3268
03:18:48,540 --> 03:18:49,260
Are you Rhea?

3269
03:18:52,380 --> 03:18:53,740
I'm going to throw you away.

3270
03:18:54,160 --> 03:18:54,860
I don't care.

3271
03:18:58,000 --> 03:18:59,300
Yeah, I know you're going away.

3272
03:18:59,680 --> 03:19:00,220
It doesn't matter.

3273
03:19:00,340 --> 03:19:01,860
I'm just going to buy.

3274
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:03,420
I flushed him down the toilet.

3275
03:19:05,500 --> 03:19:05,660
Alright.

3276
03:19:08,580 --> 03:19:10,240
Okay, I do want a solid tent.

3277
03:19:10,340 --> 03:19:12,220
I, you know, I'll keep 14 cats.

3278
03:19:12,440 --> 03:19:13,480
14 cats is okay.

3279
03:19:13,840 --> 03:19:14,720
It's not that bad.

3280
03:19:15,180 --> 03:19:16,120
Alright, let's see.

3281
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:18,400
Oh my god.

3282
03:19:18,580 --> 03:19:18,860
No!

3283
03:19:19,280 --> 03:19:20,180
Okay, there are no winners.

3284
03:19:21,240 --> 03:19:21,660
Hey, dude.

3285
03:19:21,740 --> 03:19:24,700
I was looking in your windows and seeing you got lots of
cool junk in there.

3286
03:19:24,980 --> 03:19:25,480
Oh, me.

3287
03:19:25,740 --> 03:19:26,800
I'm baby Jack.

3288
03:19:27,100 --> 03:19:29,060
At least that's what the people around me call me.

3289
03:19:29,860 --> 03:19:32,580
My Nana says it's because of how talented I am.

3290
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:34,180
I'm a superhero, you know.

3291
03:19:35,820 --> 03:19:39,200
Now I also say good boys do nice things, so I gotta get for
you.

3292
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:41,380
Well, I just just gave you.

3293
03:19:41,700 --> 03:19:43,420
That's what rich people call furniture.

3294
03:19:44,300 --> 03:19:48,040
Furniture around these parts is filled with Jesus juice, but
we can talk about that later.

3295
03:19:48,520 --> 03:19:49,400
See that tab up there?

3296
03:19:49,780 --> 03:19:50,200
Check it.

3297
03:19:50,240 --> 03:19:52,280
Then you can fill your house with all kind of junk.

3298
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:52,740
Okay.

3299
03:19:53,800 --> 03:19:55,740
I'll be with Nona in my little shack.

3300
03:19:55,960 --> 03:19:56,500
See ya.

3301
03:19:56,740 --> 03:19:58,800
Oh, I got soda cans.

3302
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:01,660
I'll put it here.

3303
03:20:02,960 --> 03:20:05,040
I guess it looks a little nicer, right?

3304
03:20:05,720 --> 03:20:06,860
The soda can?

3305
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:08,760
Alright, Tristan.

3306
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:10,140
I mean, you ain't too bad.

3307
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:13,400
You're left Oh my god, you are a scary cat.

3308
03:20:17,140 --> 03:20:20,340
Oh my god, you are a very scary cat.

3309
03:20:24,380 --> 03:20:26,360
Alright, I'm gonna call it here.

3310
03:20:26,920 --> 03:20:28,220
All my cats suck.

3311
03:20:30,220 --> 03:20:32,860
Okay, wait, I'm gonna talk to Jack Shack.

3312
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:33,620
Let me go to Jack.

3313
03:20:33,740 --> 03:20:34,780
Oh, this is sad.

3314
03:20:35,380 --> 03:20:36,080
Oh, hey, it's you.

3315
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:39,220

3316
03:20:39,300 --> 03:20:40,120
She thinks you're nice.

3317
03:20:40,240 --> 03:20:41,160
I think she's right.

3318
03:20:42,260 --> 03:20:49,020

One dollar for furniture.

03:22:06,860 --> 03:22:10,140
Fifty cents for gas bills.
