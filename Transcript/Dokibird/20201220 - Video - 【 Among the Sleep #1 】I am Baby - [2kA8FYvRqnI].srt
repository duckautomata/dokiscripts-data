1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
Here we go.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,160
Here we go.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,080
Now I'm a baby.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,040
I'm a baby now chat.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,600
White day in labyrinth.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,280
I hate this.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,220
Why are there so many singing ladies?

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Please!

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,980
I'm fucking- I'm fucking singing ladies!

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,360
Why is it always singing ladies?

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,720
Ladies!

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,090
Wait, how is it?

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,570
Okay, okay.

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,290
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,910
Is this supposed to be the re- what the fuck is this resolution?

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,870
I don't know.

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,430
What am I?

18
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,770
I don't even know what resolution I'm supposed to be.

19
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,990
Okay, this is it.

20
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,910
All right.

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,170
All right, the baby.

22
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:50,970
Now I'm a baby.

23
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,630
Now I'm a baby.

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,430
That- the baby's- Baby's not that scary!

25
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,870
Can't be scary!

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,120
Okay.

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,900
All right, okay, all right, all right.

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,600
It's not- okay.

29
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,680
All right, new story.

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,620
Can't hurt me.

31
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm a fucking baby.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,000
I love this game.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,080
I've never met- yeah.

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,880
Yeah, babies can't scare me.

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,480
Okay, I need- I can- okay, walk.

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,880
Damn, I'm a fucking- I'm a smart baby.

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,280
But seriously, what the fuck is that?

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,460
What is- What is that?

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,320
What?

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,100
Oh, am I in the womb?

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,800
Oh my god, am I gonna get birthed?

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,920
What the- I'm gonna get birthed.

43
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,240
Right?

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
Oh, no.

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,520
Oh, no.

46
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,420
I'm just just drinking water.

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
I'm just drinking water.

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,180
I'm just drinking water.

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,160
I was like, damn, that's cool.

50
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,950
I don't know what the fuck is this.

51
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,510
I just went through a traumatic experience with layers of fear.

52
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,110
I don't know shit right now.

53
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,930
I was going to be like, oh shit.

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,430
This is a scary game.

55
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,530
Every scary game starts in the womb.

56
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,910
Happy birthday, sweetie.

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,650
I'm so happy.

58
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,410
Wow, two of yours today.

59
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,650
Who the fuck would think it's some fucking water?

60
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,090
I don't know.

61
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,370
I think I know a little someone who's ready for some cake.

62
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,510
Yum yum.

63
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,450
Chugga chugga chugga chugga.

64
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,310
Chew chew.

65
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,990
Were you sad in all of this?

66
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,270
Here he comes.

67
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,890
Through the tunnel.

68
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,810
There's dad.

69
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,770
There he is.

70
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,110
Oh, there's dad.

71
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,830
Oh, she's sad.

72
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,510
I'll be...

73
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,390
Oh no.

74
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,410
Oh no.

75
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,850
Why is...

76
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,010
Oh no.

77
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,170
What are you doing?

78
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,220
Oh, dad.

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,640
Get out.

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,460
Get out, dad.

81
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,220
Am I sad?

82
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
Hey.

83
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,200
I can count too.

84
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:38,680
Hey.

85
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,560
Look what I found.

86
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,300
Huh?

87
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,640
I wonder what it is.

88
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,060
Why don't we go upstairs?

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,920
Yeah, dad.

90
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,940
Where were you?

91
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,260
Huh?

92
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,320
Where were you when I was fucking drinking water and not being in the womb?

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,320
Oh my.

94
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,940
How much cake did you have?

95
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,610
Where's she taking me?

96
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,050
Oh god.

97
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,490
I don't wanna look at her face.

98
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,910
What the fuck?

99
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,930
Oh my god.

100
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,850
Oh my god.

101
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,250
Oh my god.

102
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,990
I still keep doing medics on the table.

103
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,600
Oh, it's getting dark.

104
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,760
Oh, it's getting dark.

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Okay, there's monsters that chase me in this game.

106
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,820
That's all I know.

107
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,780
And like, you know what?

108
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,280
That's fine.

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,640
Like, fuck the psychological horror shit.

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,740
I'm done with that.

111
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,900
I don't care.

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,060
Just fucking chase me, monsters.

113
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,240
Like, I'd rather have monsters chase me than going through that bullshit again.

114
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,810
I'm a baby.

115
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,210
Oh, they just moved.

116
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,190
Look at all these boxes.

117
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,230
Oh, they just moved.

118
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,230
Look at all these boxes.

119
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,910
Shit, what the fuck?

120
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,610
This baby has such a big room.

121
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,250
This room is bigger than, like, my room.

122
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:05,690
This room is bigger than, like, my room.

123
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,450
Or maybe it's because I'm tiny that's why it looks big.

124
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:12,770
Or maybe it's because I'm tiny that's why it looks big.

125
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,210
Okay, sweetie.

126
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,810
Baby's flexing hard.

127
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,990
Like, or maybe I'm just tiny.

128
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,470
It looks like you hate horror games.

129
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,990
Yes, I absolutely...

130
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,470
God, please.

131
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,730
I don't wanna look at you.

132
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,770
Yes, I...

133
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,190
Did you just see me rage quit a game after 20, 30 minutes?

134
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,690
Yes, I fucking hate horror games.

135
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,610
I hate horror games so much.

136
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,450
This is why it was a sub goal.

137
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:42,750
I hate horror games so much.

138
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,690
This is exactly why this was a sub goal.

139
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,150
Space to climb.

140
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:56,950
Okay.

141
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,060
Alright.

142
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh, there's shit to run.

143
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,100
I don't... Oh my god, she's so...

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,420
Oh my god, what the fuck?

145
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,200
I need a...

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,740
Dude, the sensitivity is actually crazy.

147
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,240
I don't... Dude, what the fuck is the sensitivity?

148
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,070
Where are you going?

149
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,270
Good morning.

150
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:26,710
Oh!

151
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,350
I was just wondering what the hell is happening.

152
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,430
You were scared of stairs.

153
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,030
Okay, here you go.

154
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,690
Uh...

155
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,530
Yeah, oh!

156
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,650
What?

157
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,050
What?

158
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,830
What the fuck?

159
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,570
Okay.

160
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,450
What the fuck is that?

161
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,110
Is there something inside?

162
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,510
Get out.

163
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:56,930
Get out.

164
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,830
Did I jump on it?

165
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,630
Do I... Do I...

166
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,210
Do I jump on it?

167
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,110
Wait, was... Oh, he was in the toy chest!

168
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,690
Oh, he was in the toy chest!

169
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,190
I just thought he was in the pillow!

170
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,470
I... I thought he was in the pillow!

171
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,190
I just thought he was in the pillow!

172
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,230
Hello.

173
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:16,990
Hello.

174
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,670
Hey.

175
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,310
Hey.

176
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,470
What's your name?

177
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,780
Not much of a talker yet, eh?

178
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,500
Not much of a talker yet, eh?

179
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,480
The pillows are so...

180
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,160
jiggly.

181
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,960
Let's play a game.

182
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,640
Yeah, I thought the teddy bear...

183
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,020
I thought the teddy bear was in the pillow!

184
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,780
That's why I was like trying to... I was like, Oh, do I like fling it around?

185
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,100
And then he's gonna come out?

186
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,000
Baby.

187
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,380
Come here.

188
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,400
Turn around and cover your eyes.

189
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,080
Okay.

190
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,480
There.

191
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,660
You can look now.

192
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,500
Oh, that's cool!

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,400
What?

194
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,040
What do you want me to do?

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,100
I didn't listen to...

196
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,440
I didn't...

197
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,340
I didn't listen to what he said!

198
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,820
Wait, what did he want me to...

199
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,100
Oh!

200
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,880
Oh!

201
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,060
Find the elephant!

202
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,420
I was like, What do you want me to do?

203
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,120
Oh, here?

204
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay.

205
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,720
Is it here?

206
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,940
Super warm.

207
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,000
Super warm.

208
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,360
Oh, here you are!

209
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,240
Super warm.

210
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,460
Found it!

211
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,020
Is Teddy second at Cheap as Mom?

212
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:54,600
Is Teddy second at Cheap as Mom?

213
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,040
I mean, yeah.

214
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,320
He's like sewn in with patches and stuff.

215
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,720
And everything.

216
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,740
Dude, I can't even...

217
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,100
Holy shit.

218
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,940
Dude, this child...

219
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,020
This child has some...

220
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,040
Spooky ass toys.

221
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,960
This kid has so much shit.

222
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,260
Dude, what the fuck?

223
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,160
He has so many toys.

224
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
What do you want me to do?

225
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,940
Oh my gosh.

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
Animal, thank you so much for the follow!

227
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

228
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,720
I do appreciate it.

229
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Have a butt heart.

230
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,400
Thank you so much.

231
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,000
Okay, I need to...

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,860
Give me a sec.

233
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,680
I need to turn up the volume of my game.

234
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,620
Because I had it turned up all the way to 7.

235
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,520
So I couldn't hear shit.

236
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,640
I couldn't...

237
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,100
What do you want me to do?

238
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
Do you think the music box still works?

239
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,440
Huh.

240
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,980
That's a nice melody.

241
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,380
What do you want me to do?

242
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,950
Is he gonna push me somewhere?

243
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,330
Oh, I crawl faster.

244
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,650
What the...

245
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,410
What the fuck?

246
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,450
Oh my god!

247
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:26,890
Okay.

248
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,030
Okay.

249
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,110
Pay attention in the...

250
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,650
In the...

251
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,110
It's okay, I have chat to pay attention for me.

252
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,830
I can just do this.

253
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:44,370
Unless we reach water with our newly dug well, I think we'll have to bid each other fairly well.

254
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,670
Dude, what the fuck?

255
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,750
He has more toys here?

256
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,170
Why does he need all these books?

257
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,430
What's this for?

258
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,070
You're like fucking two!

259
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,630
Wait, I don't know how old kids are supposed to be.

260
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:58,770
I just...

261
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,850
Round and round and round.

262
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,580
Hey, pick me up and carry me on your back.

263
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,180
Okay.

264
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,120
I wanna show you something.

265
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,260
We meet someplace very dark.

266
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,880
We meet someplace very dark.

267
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,260
We meet someplace very dark.

268
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,420
He doesn't need all these books.

269
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,120
How about your closet?

270
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,460
How about your closet?

271
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,890
Oh, true, true, true.

272
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,370
I know how old kids are supposed to be.

273
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,830
Shut the doors completely.

274
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,230
Shut the doors completely.

275
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,670
Shut the doors completely.

276
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,710
Shut the doors completely.

277
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,690
It has to be darker.

278
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,590
It has to be darker?

279
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,430
What the fuck is wrong with you?

280
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,070
What the fuck?

281
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,930
What the fuck?

282
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,290
Oh, oh, wait!

283
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,750
Why did the song change?

284
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,410
Hope there are no more...

285
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:53,830
What?

286
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:53,910
What?

287
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,910
What?

288
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,490
Why did the music change?

289
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,750
How do I hug you?

290
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,230
How do I hug you?

291
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,630
How do I hug you?

292
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,410
A little bit safer?

293
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,270
Okay...

294
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,930
Okay, I feel safe now.

295
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,390
I don't feel safe.

296
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,190
I...

297
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,130
I don't feel safe.

298
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,990
I don't feel safe.

299
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,910
What do you mean I don't feel safe?

300
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,250
I think we're...

301
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,890
What do you mean?

302
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,610
I hate this.

303
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,570
I hate this.

304
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,270
Okay, okay.

305
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,170
I'm not supposed to be here.

306
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,210
Oh!

307
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,590
Oh!

308
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,190
Oh!

309
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,890
Oh!

310
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,430
What?

311
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,190
Oh, my God.

312
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,720
Okay, what does this family have?

313
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,880
Can you hear that?

314
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,620
Okay, fuck you bear.

315
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,220
I...

316
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,760
Fuck you, teddy bear.

317
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,740
I think something's coming.

318
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,240
I think something's coming.

319
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,180
Oh, God!

320
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,720
Oh, God!

321
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,380
What are you doing in the closet?

322
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,060
I don't think we're supposed to be here!

323
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,680
Stupid fucking bear!

324
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,380
Bear's not a nice bear, confirmed.

325
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,720
God, please, I don't want to look at you.

326
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,840
Can't trust the bear.

327
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,500
Apparently not, because he was like, we're not supposed to be here!

328
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,000
God, please, I don't want to look at you.

329
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,040
Oh my god.

330
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,060
Rude ass bear lying about monsters and shit.

331
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,220
Dude, I already forgot his name.

332
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,060
I just know he's a piece of shit.

333
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,100
He's your fair- bear- I'm right now saying-

334
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
God, I hate this.

335
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,080
I hate this.

336
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,220
Please, stop singing!

337
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,400
Please, stop putting- please stop putting ladies singing!

338
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,920
Please!

339
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,460
How long

340
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,630
is this game chat?

341
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,650
How long is this game, guys?

342
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,570
Sing back to assert dominance?

343
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,130
Oh my god!

344
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,450
Preacher, thank you so much for the follow!

345
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,130
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

346
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,350
Have a butt heart!

347
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,230
What the fuck?

348
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,750
What the- what the fuck?

349
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,240
Five hours long?

350
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,980
If you- oh, so it'll just take me three hours.

351
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,260
Or two hours.

352
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,980
Am I moving?

353
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,700
Is my bed moving?

354
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,160
Oh, I hate this.

355
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,160
Oh, oh, oh.

356
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,340
Oh!

357
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,870
Why do I need to peek around corners?

358
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,570
Huh?

359
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,430
Why do I need to peek around corners?

360
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,660
How?

361
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,440
How do I peek?

362
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,940
It won't let me!

363
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Why doesn't it let me peek around corners?

364
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,860
What?

365
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,380
Why is the M6?

366
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,960
Oh, I must be sta- oh.

367
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,460
Hey, look at that.

368
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,020
I did it.

369
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,220
I had to stat.

370
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,820
I did it.

371
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,340
I'm baby.

372
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,540
I'm baby.

373
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:34,940

374
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,740

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,360

376
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,360
I'm babyyyy!

377
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,040

378
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,780
Please.

379
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,260
Awww!

380
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,500
Okay.

381
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,660
Okay.

382
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm baby.

383
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,260
I'm baby.

384
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm baby.

385
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,900
I'm baby.

386
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm- no.

387
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,240
Don't...

388
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,900
Don't you...

389
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,100
Don't you fuck with me.

390
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,800
Don't you fuck with me, Rem!

391
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,170
Why is this atmospheric sound so... I hate this!

392
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,370
Why is the atmospheric sound so...

393
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,990
Why?

394
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,570
This is supposed to be psychological!

395
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,390
This is supposed to be psychological!

396
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,250
Looking... looking... looking...

397
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,420
I'm looking... I'm looking!

398
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,440
Why?

399
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,580
Is there another baby crying?

400
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,540
Why is there another baby crying?

401
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,900
Why did I wait until 2am to play this game?

402
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,200
Okay, RwC Amateurs is getting to her.

403
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,160
Konichiwa!

404
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,640
Konichiwa!

405
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,540
Ninten, shut the fuck up.

406
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,620
Ninten, shut the fuck up.

407
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,380
I can't!

408
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,620
A baby!

409
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,680
Why is this so scary?

410
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,280
Okay, okay, okay, I got this.

411
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,040
I got this.

412
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,770
Okay.

413
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,430
FUCK IT.

414
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,650
OH!

415
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:56,970
OH!

416
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,690
THE SHADOW!

417
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,590
THE SHADOW!

418
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,290
Love you.

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:02,890
Love you.

420
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,730
Love you, man.

421
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,810
Love you.

422
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,650
I got scared by the shadow!

423
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,370
I got scared by the shadow!

424
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,610
Oh my god.

425
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,970
Okay.

426
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,630
Why is... why is he crying?

427
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,870
Why are you crying?

428
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,150
Please stop crying, please!

429
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:36,870
Okay.

430
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,010
Okay.

431
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,070
Alright.

432
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,150
Alright, give me a sec guys.

433
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,610
Oh, wait is my teddy bear here?

434
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,030
Wait, how do I... Teddy bear!

435
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,830
How do I... Teddy!

436
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,090

437
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,450
Oh my god, Teddy!

438
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,750
Teddy!

439
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,410
How do I get Teddy out?

440
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,950
How do I get you out, Teddy?

441
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,810
Oh, I plugged you... oh yeah, yeah I'm so sorry.

442
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,130
Power, power.

443
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,450
Oh god.

444
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,750
Oh sorry, I'm not okay, I'm dying.

445
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,450
I'm not okay, I'm freaking out here.

446
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,150
I'm just hiding behind this washer.

447
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,090
Alright, Teddy.

448
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,510
Alright, you stupid rock.

449
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,310
Oh!

450
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,750
What the fuck!

451
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,110
Teddy, this is... I scared him.

452
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:48,010
Oh my god, his eyes actually scared me when he... when the eyes looked at me and I looked back.

453
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,230
I freaked out.

454
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,690
I can't... I wish I could stay in my sleep, I'd be brave and hang in there.

455
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,630
Noticity.

456
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,730
Okay, goodnight, Noticity.

457
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,010
Goodnight.

458
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,490
Oh, oh, Teddy.

459
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,350
There is nothing for you now.

460
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,630
I don't like that wording.

461
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,890
For you now.

462
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,450
For you now.

463
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,550
Alright, chat.

464
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:16,850
Alright.

465
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,070
You know what?

466
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,790
Toy.

467
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,790
Oh.

468
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:20,690
Oh.

469
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,270
Oh, should I plug you back in?

470
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,420
Okay, apparently...

471
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,420
Okay.

472
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,660
Okay.

473
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,140
Okay.

474
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,900
Okay, now run.

475
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,340

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:52,980
Ah!

478
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,500
Wait.

479
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,900
Wait.

480
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,240
No!

481
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,700
No!

482
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,460
Please!

483
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,420
Please keep crawling!

484
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,360
Please keep crawling!

485
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,840
Baby!

486
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,540
You're baby!

487
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,480
You're a babe!

488
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,100
Oh, baby, why can't you crawl?

489
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,600
Why can't you crawl, baby?

490
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,280
I'm safe.

491
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,260
Am I not supposed to be here?

492
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,220
Did I fuck up?

493
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,440
Did I fuck up?

494
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,380
Wait, aren't you suppo- Oh, I didn't find mom?

495
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,320
Dude, what the fuck?

496
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,080
Why didn't you find mom?

497
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,900
Just stay inside!

498
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,320
Okay.

499
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,420
Uh.

Oh, no!

502
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,740
Mom can do whatever she wants!

503
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,580
I have to run back out?

504
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:49,880
No!

505
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,760
Okay.

Baby.

512
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,730
Baby.

513
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,610
Strong baby!

514
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,410
Okay.

515
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,290
We're here for support.

516
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,230
Okay.

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,930
I hate this.

520
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,890
I hate the sounds.

521
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,830
I hate all the sounds it's making.

522
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,450
Okay.

523
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,090
Yeah.

524
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,990
Yeah, no thing.

525
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,600
Uh.

526
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,240
Uh.

527
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:28,760

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,900
Strong baby.

536
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,100
Baby, you're strong!

537
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,400
God.

538
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,080
Oh, god.

539
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,780
Not the stairs.

540
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,460
No.

541
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,780
Not stairs again.

542
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,040
Not stairs!

543
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,500
Oh.

544
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,020
Ah!

545
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,900
Fucking shut up!

546
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,380
Can't you find us?

547
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,180
Can't you find us?

548
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,240
Can't you find us?

549
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,880
God.

550
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,640
Fucking bear!

551
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,300
Ah!

552
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,640
Ah!

553
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,210
Oh, saving.

554
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,630
Why is it saving?

555
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,450
It's just it's...

556
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,570
Run?

557
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,330
Run where?

558
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,610
Up?

559
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,040
Oh, I hate this.

560
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,160
I hate this.

561
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,280
I hate this.

562
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,020
I hate this.

563
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,700
I hate this.

564
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,420
Up.

565
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,080
Down.

566
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,140
Kicked.

567
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,600
Above it.

568
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:07,880
Ahhh!

569
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:08,680
Woah.

570
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,140
It's just it's just...

571
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,480
Why is my heart beating so fast?

572
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,040
What is this?

573
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,860
Baby...

574
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,180

774
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,660
Down I go.

775
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,880
Baby, go down.

776
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,480
Baby, go down.

777
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,580
Baby, go down.

778
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh my god.

779
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,100
Oh my fucking god.

780
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,640
I hate this.

781
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,160
Okay.

782
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,080
This can't be scary anymore.

783
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,160
Yes.

784
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,060
Pick you up.

785
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,420
I pick you up.

786
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,400
Alright.

787
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,640
Now I can't be scared.

788
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,900
This is just a platformer now, right?

789
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,700
This isn't scary.

790
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,880
It's not dark anymore.

791
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,700
I'm not scared.

792
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,580
I'm gonna speed run.

793
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,980
What's that doing here?

794
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,120
Oh, see.

795
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,760
There's a house.

796
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,940
Look at that.

797
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,420
Isn't that pretty?

798
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,460
Dude, this is like less scary than the fucking... my own house.

799
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,220
This is less scary than my... than this baby's house right now.

800
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,600
Is it locked?

801
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,420
I might be able to open it from the inside.

802
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,180
Yeah.

803
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,140
Go in and bet, Teddy.

804
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,380
Man, we just getting started.

805
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh my god.

806
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,060
I think I just spent like an hour playing a game... playing the fucking...

807
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,680
first ten minutes of a game.

808
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,960
I spent an hour playing ten minutes of a game.

809
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,960
God fucking baby, dude.

810
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,060
God damn baby.

811
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,660
Is this what it's here?

812
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,840
No.

813
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,920
It sounds like it's coming from behind this door.

814
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,580
There must be a way to open it.

815
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,040
It seems like...

816
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,820
These are connected somehow.

817
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Oh my god.

818
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,120
My heart.

819
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,000
My heart.

820
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,460
Oh my god.

821
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,100
I don't know how I'm gonna do the last... the last two scary streams, chat.

822
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,700
I'm... I'm...

823
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,180
Maybe it requires some sort of key.

824
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,160
Is there anything we can use?

825
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,640
I really got into that... that baby mentality.

826
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Baby.

827
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,400
Baby.

828
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:13,940
Baby.

829
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,430
Okay.

830
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,650
Oh my god.

831
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,350
You know, bring me back to Little Nightmares.

832
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,170
I'd rather fucking play Little Nightmares than this shit.

833
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,770
This first person shit... this... this first person shit is too much, dude.

834
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,690
I can't even chase my Mr. Long Arms.

835
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,550
Buttons.

836
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,870
You're like, gaga goop.

837
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,310
I just...

838
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,170
Sorry.

839
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:48,670
Shut up.

840
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,150
I'm vlogging.

841
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,430
What happened?

842
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,990
Why didn't it open?

843
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,830
I played...

844
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:55,930
No.

845
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:56,370
No.

846
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,350
There's no stream tomorrow.

847
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,170
Oh my god.

848
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,410
There's definitely...

849
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,970
There's definitely no stream tomorrow, chat.

850
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,370
I'd rather fucking...

851
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,890
We have to press both at the same time.

852
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,550
Both at the same time?

853
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,370
Oh.

854
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,470
That's it.

855
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:10,990
I was like, what do you mean?

856
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,670
Where's the button?

857
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,410
See?

858
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,370
Yeah, Layers of Fear is gonna be a fucking sub goal.

859
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:23,790
There is no fucking way I am playing Layers... Layers of Fear.

860
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,630
No, I streamed yesterday so...

861
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,070
It's just cause I was for the sub goal.

862
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,310
But holy...

863
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,730
I am not streaming Layers of Fear unless...

864
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,770
Unless it's a sub goal.

865
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,630
There is...

866
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,130
There's no fucking way.

867
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,850
Fucking...

868
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,690
There is no way I am fucking playing Layers of Fear after that.

869
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,330
Dude, no.

870
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:52,990
Not P.T.

871
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,570
I've watched gameplay of P.T., dude.

872
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,550
There is no way I am playing P.T.

873
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,230
There is no fucking way.

874
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,210
That lady...

875
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,650
Dude, that lady, dude.

876
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,470
I thought the other lady...

877
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,030
The other lady was scary but that lady...

878
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,930
Oh my god.

879
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,750
I don't wanna go in.

880
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,550
Why did they...

881
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,510
Why did the music stop?

882
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,450
I hate this.

883
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:24,890
I hate this music.

884
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,920
Okay.

885
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,900
How many subs?

886
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,060
Okay.

887
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,600
Why did you like that earlier?

888
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,440
Why didn't you like that earlier?

889
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,760
What did we learn?

890
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,240
A f***ing baby!

891
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,040
That's the only thing I learned about this game!

892
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,760
Okay.

893
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,980
Okay, this is not scary.

894
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,520
I'm not at home.

895
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,120
Oh my god, I hate it when the baby makes sounds when he's climbing.

896
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,650
I hate this.

897
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,370
Baby, please stop making... please stop... I think I believe in you!

898
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,010
Thank you so much for the five bits, Plana!

899
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,990
Thank you!

900
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,270
Oh hey, what are you?

901
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,730
Baby... baby... baby...

902
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,190
Thank you, thank you for the five bits!

903
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,210
Okay.

904
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,170
Alright.

905
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,470
Oh, does it just... oh, it just keeps going!

906
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,350
Please stop making sounds!

907
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,190
Okay.

908
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,710
Baby run, baby hide, baby smile...

909
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:04,770
Okay, I think one... I don't think one of them is the right... is the right...

910
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,410
Baby spin!

911
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,910
Baby spin.

912
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,410
Okay.

913
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,170
Oh my god.

914
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,390
A memory?

915
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,830
Oh, memory is good!

916
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,330
Memory is good!

917
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,290
Memory means not scary!

918
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,120
Memory good!

919
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,380
Is there a way up this tower?

920
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,800
Okay.

921
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,660
Oh, memory good.

922
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,500
Puzzle!

923
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,660
Puzzle no scary!

924
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,200
Oh, thank god!

925
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,740
Thank god it's puzzle!

926
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,240
That... oh!

927
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,600
Hey, Panda!

928
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,800
Nothing scary about a playground.

929
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,640
Nothing scary about that!

930
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,840
Oh my god.

931
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,520
Why is there...

932
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,420
Okay, okay, where is just this?

933
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,980
Okay, I was gonna be like, do I need to hide?

934
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,660
Do I need to hide or something?

935
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,700
Oh, oh...

936
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:16,920
Ah!

937
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,280
Ah!

938
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,220

939
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I crawl, I crawl, I crawl, I'm stuck, I'm stuck!

940
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, bye!

941
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:22,780
Bear!

942
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,220
Bear!

943
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:23,500
Bear!

944
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:23,880
Hug!

945
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,320
Hug!

946
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,760
Hug!

947
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,200
Hug!

948
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,140
I'm sick.

949
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,780
I'm sick.

950
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh, why is it dark?

951
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,120
Why are you dark?

952
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,740
It's okay, I hug.

953
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,440
I hug.

954
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,060
Oh, oh, it's saved.

955
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,760
I don't like that it's saved.

956
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,220
I don't like that!

957
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,200
How do I get up?

958
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,240
How do I get up?

959
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,380
How do I... that wasn't even my phone.

960
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:21,780
That wasn't my phone.

961
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,360
How do I... how do I get up?

962
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,060
Oh, I don't know how that's... that's how I get up.

963
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,510
I don't like puzzles, baby don't like puzzles.

964
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,790
Baby... baby can't think right now.

965
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,280
Baby can't think.

966
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,760
Please don't make baby think.

967
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,840
What do I...

968
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,410
Please... oh, baby think.

969
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,430
Baby's thinking.

970
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,410
Please.

971
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,390
Wait.

972
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,740
What was that sound?

973
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,980
Oh... oh, I have to go in here.

974
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,760
Baby's stupid.

975
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,720
Baby's stupid right now.

976
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,180
Look, my brain's still developing, guys.

977
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,250
Baby brain's...

978
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:48,970
Baby's brain... is still developing.

979
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,770
What the fuck?

980
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,530
Okay.

981
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,680
Why are you scared?

982
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,080
Why are you scared, baby?

983
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,000
Baby, stop being scared!

984
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,060
Stop this!

985
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,160
Stop this!

986
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,610
Hold on, sorry, there's no wrinkle zone.

987
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,690
Anyone find... find...

988
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,890
This creeps me out.

989
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,230
I hope your mother is okay.

990
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,770
Who's this?

991
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:44,110
Who's this?

992
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,660
Oh... oh... oh... down?

993
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,260
Oh... did I die?

994
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,120
Did baby... oh, baby died!

995
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,980
I was like, down!

996
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,520
I thought we were supposed to go down!

997
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,560
I was like, yeah, down!

998
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,380
We're baby!

999
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:23,980
Okay.

1000
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,340
Clearly, it was not... I... okay.

1001
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,720
It was not down.

1002
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,440
It wasn't down.

1003
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,860
Okay.

1004
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,180
Alright.

1005
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,480
Okay, okay.

1006
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,720
Okay.

1007
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,420
Where the fuck do I go?

1008
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,100
Oh, there's another entrance.

1009
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,920
What the...

1010
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,020
Oh, what the fuck is... I thought that was like... what the fuck is wrong with this?

1011
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,840
Okay.

1012
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,780
How can baby die?

1013
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,040
What?

1014
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,780
Get out.

1015
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,210
Well, like...

1016
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,400
I hate this.

1017
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,180
I... oh... you should try... I've never... dude, I... no!

1018
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,160
No!

1019
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:30,620
No!

1020
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,740
I can barely function right now!

1021
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,620
As a baby!

1022
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,700
I can't even function as a baby!

1023
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,060
Let alone...

1024
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,940
I have one more video card!

1025
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,700
Baby!

1026
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,400
Baby!

1027
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,110
One more.

1028
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,660
I have one more??

1029
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,890
Oh my god.

1030
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,530
I have two more!

1031
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,360
What the fuck's wrong with you, baby?

1032
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,090
Baby can't count, chat.

1033
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,030
Baby can't count.

1034
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,730
I thought we... I thought we established that.

1035
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,150
Now, you're gonna have to give us a chance to...

1036
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,460
Baby doesn't know how to count.

1037
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,860
My brain cannot process that.

1038
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,360
What the fuck was that for?

1039
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,580
Oh it's because it's hand turned.

1040
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:44,660
Okay.

1041
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:46,660
Okay.

1042
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,160
Where's the owl?

1043
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,500
Owl?

1044
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,100
Owl?

1045
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,540
What the fuck?

1046
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,940
Where the fuck's the owl?

1047
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,680
What the fuck?

1048
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,660
Why did it make baby climb?

1049
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,200
Please stop screaming.

1050
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,400
Please.

1051
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,820
Please stop screaming.

1052
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,820
I don't know what you want from me.

1053
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,900
I don't...

1054
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,520
I'll scream back.

1055
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,980
Please just stop.

1056
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,500
I'll scream back.

1057
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,640
I'm so go...

1058
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,360
Is that it?

1059
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,220
Oh there it is.

1060
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,280
There you go.

1061
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,240
There it is.

1062
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,800
There you are.

1063
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,600
Baby's smart.

1064
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,780
Please stop.

1065
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,580
I'm running.

1066
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,540
I'm running.

1067
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,160
I'm running.

1068
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:05,760
I'm running.

1069
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,700
Please stop falling.

1070
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:18,770
Please.

1071
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:19,410
Please.

1072
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,030
No anymore.

1073
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,410
I keep forgetting that anyone was there.

1074
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,890
Where's the last one?

1075
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:30,710
Ah.

1076
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:50,150
Here?

1077
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,150
Wait is that it?

1078
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:53,590
Owl?

1079
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,150
Is that you?

1080
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:55,670
Oh no.

1081
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,310
That's just rocks.

1082
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,410
That's just rocks.

1083
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,070
That's just rocks.

1084
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,430
Why?

1085
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,530
Where the fuck is the last...

1086
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,480
my lifeblood?

1087
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,840
Thank you so much for the follow!

1088
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,040
Thank you!

1089
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,960
Have a... have a butt heart!

1090
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,300
Have a butt heart!

1091
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,880
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1092
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,180
Alright.

1093
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,170
I have this... where the fuck is the last one?

1094
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:44,990
Where are you?

1095
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,260
Uhhh... up?

1096
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,720
Up.

1097
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,380
Up.

1098
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:55,980
Up!

1099
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,540
Okay.

1100
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,620
Alright.

1101
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,380
Oh...

1102
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,920
No fear.

1103
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,700
Just... just actions.

1104
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,520
Head empty.

1105
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,820
I've been released as one AIM.

1106
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,260
Can't sleep.

1107
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,620
So you gotta go the fuck to sleep.

1108
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,320
What the fuck?

1109
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,380
Why are you watching me try to play a scary game?

1110
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,440
You're not gonna be sleeping anytime soon.

1111
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,620
Watching this.

1112
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,180
Yes, where she be running?

1113
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,620
I've been running so...

1114
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,880
I've been running...

1115
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,480
Oh my god.

1116
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:27,860
No.

1117
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,340
No.

1118
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,310
Yeah, cause this stream is not gonna get you to sleep.

1119
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:38,950
So you gotta...

1120
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,270
This is... this stream...

1121
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,210
Oh...

1122
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:43,490
Ah!

1123
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,470
All fear.

1124
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,370
All fear.

1125
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,950
Panda, thank you so much for the five bits.

1126
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,230
All fear.

1127
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:03,810
All fear.

1128
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,610
Oh my

1129
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,020
god.

1130
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,800
Where is it?

1131
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,340
Where is it?

1132
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,060
So much fear.

1133
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,760
There is so much fear in me.

1134
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,280
There is so much fear in me.

1135
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,200
There is...

1136
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,600
There is...

1137
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,380
Haha!

1138
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,040
Haha!

1139
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,900
Dude, I should probably sleep with two...

1140
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,180
But this is too fast.

1141
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,400
Where the fuck is the last one?

1142
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,560
Where the fuck is the last one?

1143
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,580
Ah!

1144
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,240
Here?

1145
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,220
Ah!

1146
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,060
What the fuck is wrong with this?

1147
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,080
Where are you?

1148
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:00,980
Wow.

1149
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,180
Ow.

1150
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,980
Rock.

1151
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:04,820

1152
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,860

00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,180
Okay.

1157
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Why the fuck is a tire stronger than...

1158
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,100
than a baby?

1159
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,040
That's so stupid.

1160
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,160
Oh,

1162
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,590
Baby run.

1163
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,930
Baby run.

1164
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,550
Baby run.

1165
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,090
Baby.

1166
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,250
Baby no run.

1167
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,550

1168
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,630
Baby run.

1169
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,290
Baby run.

1170
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,010
Baby run.

1171
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,370
Baby running.

1172
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:42,490
Baby's running.

1173
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:45,910
Hahaha.

1174
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:48,690
Baby.

1175
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,150
Baby.

1176
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,430
Baby.

1177
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,650
Ah!

1178
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,830
No!

1179
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:50,430
Hahaha.

1180
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:53,850
Baby.

1181
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:54,550
Baby.

1182
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:54,670
Baby.

1183
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:54,810
Baby, please.

1184
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,370
Please.

1185
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,030
Baby.

1186
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:56,710
Okay.

1187
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,730
Thank God.

1188
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,950
Where's tire's driving?

1189
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:01,730
Is he driving on the floor?

1190
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:02,250
Baby.

1191
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,210
Hahaha.

1192
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:05,510
Okay.

1193
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,330
Alright.

1194
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,770
Oh my God.

1195
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:08,810
Wasn't even hard.

1196
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:10,430
Wasn't even hard.

1197
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,830
Baby's so fucking smart.

1198
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,970
The tire had certain potential gravitational energy.

1199
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,290
So it had the ability to move the rock.

1200
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,170
Who only... Okay.

1201
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,810

1202
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:26,870
Please, stop.

1203
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,530
Baby, you should not be scared right here.

1204
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,410
You should be scared a lot longer than this.

1205
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,990
Okay.

1206
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,280

00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,280

00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,960
I've never... Okay, okay, we're in memories.

1212
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,080
It's memory zone.

1213
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,840
We're in memories town now.

1214
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,160
Oh, thank god.

00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,920
Not scared because it's memory time.

1217
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,440
Not scared because it's memories.

1218
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,660

1219
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,400

Okay.

1228
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,800
Oh god, please.

1229
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,300
No.

1230
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,220
Shit.

1231
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,660
It's still memory?

1232
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,040
It's still memory.

1233
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,130

00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,970
You and me will work this all out together.

1255
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,070
Don't be afraid.

1256
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,370
Oh god, I fucking hate my day.

1257
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,570
The fuck?

1258
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,790
Don't be afraid.

Stupid bear.

1262
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,960
Oh my god.

1263
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,300
Okay, I need one... Okay, I got the second one now.

1264
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,060
I need two more.

1265
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,840
I need two more and then I'm done.

1266
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,660
Oh my god.

1267
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,740
How long is this game again?

1268
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,540
Hahaha.

1269
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,960

Man, this looks unbearable.

1277
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,200
I don't know if I chose the famous portal here.

1278
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,420
But he was like, yeah, dude, don't worry.

1279
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,240
Oh god, why is this so dark?

1280
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,420
Why is this so dark, bear?

1281
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,540
I hate this.

1282
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,240
I...

1283
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,380
Hahaha.

1284
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,280

Oh, the candle.

1288
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,800
Oh.

Oh shit, I can... Oh, I can do this.

00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,920
Okay.

1291
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,460
Okay, look.

1292
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,780
Boop.

1293
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,120
He's not saying I'm safe.

1294
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:01,920
Okay.

1295
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,940
Leer's a baby.

1296
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:05,920
Hahaha.

1297
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,060
This is the only thing that's keeping me sane right now.

1298
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,060
This is the...

1299
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,120
Oh, do we...

1300
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,660

What the fuck was that?

1303
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,980
Oh, that was just my reflection.

1304
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,100
Hahaha.

1305
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,240
Okay.

1306
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,460
Okay.

1307
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,120
Okay.

1308
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:41,940
Okay.

1309
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,100
Okay.

1310
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,540
Okay.

Let's just, let me process this real quick and yeah.

1314
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,620
Calm down.

1315
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,280
Yeah.

1316
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:56,180
Okay.

1317
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:57,940
Okay.

1318
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:58,540
Okay.

1319
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:59,140
Okay.

1320
01:00:59,140 --> 01:00:59,180
Okay.

1321
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,200
Okay.

1322
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:00,860
Okay.

1323
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,820
I'm truly baby.

1324
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,380
I'm truly baby guys.

1325
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,020
So you got the rest of the team covering the camp.

1326
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,380
Can't do nothing on you.

1327
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,700
I hate this.

1328
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,900
I'm practically in layers of fear right now.

1329
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,050
I don't like this.

1330
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,210
I don't... I don't like this.

1331
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,960
What are you... what are you... what the... Peter!

1332
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,440
I'm fucking... fucking Peter.

1333
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,000
I didn't think about keeping quiet until now.

1334
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,320
I didn't think about it.

1335
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,060
Okay.

1336
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,700
It is my serious regret to inform you that we have lost Rain to the void.

1337
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,380
They will not be coming back ever.

1338
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,640
So please send them your love now before they go.

1339
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,340
Rest in peace my dear Braydyne.

1340
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,380
Okay.

1341
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:15,980
Why is there shit?

1342
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,280
Why are there trees?

1343
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,400
Why the fuck are there trees in here?

1344
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,320
Okay.

1345
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,090
Okay.

1346
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:25,710
Baby.

1347
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:28,770
Baby.

1348
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:30,850
We're okay.

1349
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,270
Baby okay.

1350
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,020
Baby okay.

1351
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,260
Why did it change?

1352
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,820
Okay.

1353
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,240
Okay now we're outside.

1354
01:02:59,060 --> 01:02:59,700
Okay.

1355
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,420
Outside can't hurt us.

1356
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,520
Okay I said that but then we were in the playground last time.

1357
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,940
Those floaty things.

1358
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,920
They look like memories.

1359
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,580
Memories!

1360
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,280
Memories!

1361
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,440
Memories can't hurt us!

1362
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,400
Climb those roots.

1363
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,620
Memories can't hurt us.

1364
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,900
Memories can't hurt us.

1365
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,900
Let me out.

1366
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:20,080
Let me... what the fuck?

1367
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,520
Climb!

1368
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,060
Memory!

1369
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,260
I need my... oh.

1370
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,480
Oh what the fuck is this?

1371
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,080
What?

1372
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,200
I can climb this.

1373
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,020
No.

1374
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:35,580
No!

1375
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,180
I want memory!

1376
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,300
No!

1377
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:38,960
No!

1378
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,800
Not puzzles!

1379
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,520
I wanted memories not puzzles!

1380
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,300
Oh no.

1381
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,620
I need three puzzles.

1382
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:56,490
Okay.

1383
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,410
Oh my god.

1384
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:59,130
Why are there paintings?

1385
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:04,070
I fucking left layers of fear and they're giving me paintings again.

1386
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,790
Why are they giving me paintings again?

1387
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:08,370
I fucking left layers of fear and they're giving me paintings again.

1388
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,410
I fucking left paintings.

1389
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:15,830
I left paintings.

1390
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,870
How do I fucking get out?

1391
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,120
Do I crawl?

1392
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,360
Baby crawl?

1393
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,240
Baby?

1394
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,160
Baby?

1395
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,220
Baby no.

1396
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:35,980
Oh chair!

1397
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,180
Chair.

1398
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,040
Okay okay I just need a...

1399
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,720
Yeah that's... baby got this.

1400
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,560
Baby strong.

1401
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,220
Baby please.

1402
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,300
Okay maybe not cheer.

1403
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,360
Send those braids to everyone.

1404
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,140
You got this puzzle.

1405
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,800
Oh oh oh.

1406
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:56,220
Yeah?

1407
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:56,700
Yeah?

1408
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,340
Okay no.

1409
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,200
Okay that wasn't it.

1410
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,540
That was... oh oh.

1411
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,200
Baby strong.

1412
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:09,840
Okay.

1413
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,160
Alright baby you got this.

1414
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,040
Okay maybe that wasn't it.

1415
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,540
Maybe baby doesn't got this.

1416
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,420
What the fuck am I supposed to do baby?

1417
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,880
My brain is still developing.

1418
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,960
I don't know shit.

1419
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,140
Am I really stuck on...

1420
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,150
Baby so smart.

1421
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:36,210
Hey that's alright.

1422
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,410
You thought you got me.

1423
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:38,710
I'm a smart baby.

1424
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,470
I'm a smart baby.

1425
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,320
Baby okay I might be blind but I'm smart.

1426
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:53,020
What's the real MVP there?

1427
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,960
I hate this.

1428
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,060
I fucking hate this.

1429
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,920
Oh oh oh dark.

1430
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,400
Good morning Arkanoid.

1431
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,240
Baby Mario.

1432
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,600
Baby pole?

1433
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,500
Baby pole?

1434
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,300
Baby.

1435
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,160
Okay maybe that's not it.

1436
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,380
Okay okay.

1437
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,000
Ah!

1438
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:41,960
Water.

1439
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,560
I can't water.

1440
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:50,860
Ah!

1441
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,450
What is this game?

1442
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,730
I don't... I'm... I'm baby.

1443
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,730
That's what this game is about.

1444
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,330
I'm a little baby.

1445
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:12,600
Push.

1446
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,780
Hey baby.

1447
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,600
You got this baby.

1448
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:36,110
Alright.

1449
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,970
Alright who's still...

1450
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,690
Thanks for hanging out with us today.

1451
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:44,270
I... I hope you... I hope you enjoyed baby stream.

1452
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,850
I hope...

1453
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:47,310
Oh I hate this.

1454
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,900
I... Why... Why do people play horror games?

1455
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,100
What the fuck is wrong with all of us?

1456
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,440
What is wrong with us?

1457
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,800
I don't even know how far we are.

1458
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,020
Is this a sad boy?

1459
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:14,800
What the fuck?

1460
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,100
Oh my god he's a sad boy.

1461
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,020
Stupid bee.

1462
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,680
I hate this.

1463
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,380
I think... I think she...

1464
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,500
Am I halfway?

1465
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:51,620
Push.

1466
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,840
Baby push.

1467
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,940
Oh I don't fucking need you Teddy.

1468
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,540
What do I do with this?

1469
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:00,760
Box.

1470
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,000
Box.

1471
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,490
Baby push.

1472
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:15,490
Baby...

1473
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:18,830
What the fuck do I do with you?

1474
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:20,910
Box.

1475
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:24,330
Yeah okay.

1476
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:27,410
How the fuck am I able to push a box but not a rock earlier?

1477
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:28,470
Jesus Christ.

1478
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:28,790
I don't know.

1479
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,990
This is so inconsistent.

1480
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:37,990
I can fucking push a box but not a rock.

1481
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,330
Because a rock made of rock.

1482
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,830
But box is box.

1483
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:42,990
What the fuck?

1484
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:43,630
There.

1485
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:44,610
What the...

1486
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,630
Stupid baby.

1487
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:55,830
Baby.

1488
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:56,430
Baby.

1489
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,110
Baby.

1490
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:58,490
Baby.

1491
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,350
Baby drowned.

1492
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,030
Oh my god where did it take me?

1493
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,630
Where am I?

1494
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:05,350
Oh.

1495
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,810
Baby climbing in.

1496
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,530
Are babies supposed to be really...

1497
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:11,890
Oh yeah.

1498
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:15,090
Apparently babies are supposed to be really good swimmers.

1499
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:20,340
Okay.

1500
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:20,820
Okay.

1501
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,140
Well my box is still there.

1502
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,500
I'm just gonna jump.

1503
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,060
Why the fuck do I even need a box?

1504
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,860
I could've just fucking did that.

1505
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:29,880
What?

1506
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:30,800
I'm just gonna jump.

1507
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,500
I didn't even need the box in the first place.

1508
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,020
I could've just ran and landed on here.

1509
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,240
God this is so stupid.

1510
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:50,880
Okay.

1511
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:52,740
Box.

1512
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,220
Oh.

1513
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:56,840
Push box.

1514
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:00,960
What?

1515
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,720
What are heroes even babies can play?

1516
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,480
What the fuck?

1517
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,220
Oh god actually.

1518
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,040
Okay.

1519
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:12,200
I'm gonna try to push a box.

1520
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:12,540
Oh.

1521
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:12,800
Oh.

1522
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:13,760
I'm sorry.

1523
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,520
I'm sorry I touched him.

1524
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,400
I'm sorry I touched him.

1525
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,220
I'm so sorry.

1526
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,240
Oh my god.

1527
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,600
I don't know if you guys heard that sound.

1528
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,540
When I touched him it made a spooky noise.

1529
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,620
I don't know.

1530
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,180
It made a spooky noise when I touched it.

1531
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:45,370
Oh.

1532
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,510
Open.

1533
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,670
Open.

1534
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:50,770
Oh.

1535
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:55,050
There you are.

1536
01:11:58,850 --> 01:11:59,970
How do I get out?

1537
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,030
Let me out.

1538
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:04,490
Let me out of here.

1539
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:07,370
Let me...

1540
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,490
Let me out of here.

1541
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:09,870
Let me out of here.

1542
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,090
Let me out of here.

1543
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:16,170
I hate the sound he makes when he's climbing.

1544
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:20,690
Stop please.

1545
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,050
Oh my god.

1546
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:22,430
I'm gonna run so he's not gonna come a long way.

1547
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:29,490
Oh!

1548
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:29,770
Ah!

1549
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,160
Guys, you can save ULU voice- We are not saving ULU voice- for layers of fear.

1550
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,600
I forbid it.

1551
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:44,500
I fucking forbid this shit.

1552
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,420
Okay.

1553
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,540
I'll refund everyone if it fucking gets to- Baby,

1554
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,020
please be faster.

1555
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,960
Baby, please.

1556
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:04,800
Baby, please.

1557
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:05,360
I don't like this.

1558
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,700
I don't like all this sound.

1559
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,260
Baby.

1560
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,440
Get in here.

1561
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:08,980
Get in there!

1562
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,380
Get in the fuck in there!

1563
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,160
Fucking- Oh my god!

1564
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,580
Why did it take him 20 years to get in?

1565
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,080
Okay.

1566
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,920
God, Bear, you're not helping me at all.

1567
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:27,900
Bear, please.

1568
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,020
Why aren't you helping me?

1569
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,480
Why are you giving me negative reinforcements?

1570
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,880
What the fuck?

1571
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,040
My beard sucks!

1572
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,480
You're getting out there making me feel like shit!

1573
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,460
Sucking- Oh my god!

1574
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,180
Why is- Oh!

1575
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,200
What is wrong with this painting?

1576
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:50,440
Look at it!

1577
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:52,900
Why the fuck is her head gone?

1578
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,620
Monster time?

1579
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,520
Wait.

1580
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,200
Wait, what?

1581
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:05,100
Wait.

1582
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,600
Wait, what?

1583
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,260
Wait, what?

1584
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,120
Wait.

1585
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,460
Wait!

1586
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:14,720
Wait.

1587
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:14,940
What the fuck?

1588
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,280
What the fuck?

1589
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:15,940
The painting changed.

1590
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,440
What?

1591
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,080
I didn't even notice that!

1592
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,680
Oh my god!

1593
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,890
I don't want to.

1594
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:40,290
I don't like this chat.

1595
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,970
Is he still safe?

1596
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:45,750
Oh my god!

1597
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:48,930
What?

1598
01:14:58,610 --> 01:14:59,330
There's...

1599
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,660
There's...

1600
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,100
No!

1601
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,120
No!

1602
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:06,980
No!

1603
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:12,060
I was just playing each of like 10 different horror games.

1604
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,600
Dude, honestly, honestly I'm down for that.

1605
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,500
Oh my god.

1606
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,960
Is there actually monsters?

1607
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,900
Is it actually monster time through this door?

1608
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,460
Through this painting?

1609
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,860
Is it actually monsters?

1610
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,780
Fucking backseat this.

1611
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,340
I don't care anymore.

1612
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,400
I need to know.

1613
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,240
I need to know.

1614
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,480
I need to know.

1615
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:41,920
Please.

1616
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,020
Please, I don't wanna.

1617
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,380
Please chat.

1618
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:51,980
Riffle.

1619
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:52,600
Riffle.

1620
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,340
You go through this bomb.

1621
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,120
Oh my god.

1622
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,300
You have a 500 bits...

1623
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:07,720
I...

1624
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,480
I feel like you should try playing some free indie games or something.

1625
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,380
They're a whole lot less scary and more funny than anything.

1626
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,240
Chat doesn't know I fucking hate all of you.

1627
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,100
Okay, I'm going.

1628
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:24,740
Ah!

1629
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,140
Ah!

1630
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,860
This is layers of fear.

1631
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,100
This is layers of fear!

1632
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,500
You fucking... This is layers of fear!

1633
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,640
I looked in and it stared back at me.

1634
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,100
There's a fear but you're a baby.

1635
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,760
Fucking not psychological horror in my fucking ass.

1636
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,050
I don't know what you said.

1637
01:16:57,230 --> 01:16:57,990
Layers of fear.

1638
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,610
I've been lied to.

1639
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,110
It neverminds.

1640
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,450
Layers of fear.

1641
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:00,590
You're just playing as yourself.

1642
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:03,150
Baby.

1643
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,710
Baby and layers of fear.

1644
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,610
We didn't try layers of fear.

1645
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:08,590
And then...

1646
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:10,810
And then this shit happened.

1647
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,930
And then there's no more layers of fear anymore.

1648
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,150
Layers of fear is a fucking sub goal now.

1649
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,530
After what happened.

1650
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:20,670
I hate this.

1651
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:24,470
Okay, I need someone that's not gonna fuck with me.

1652
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,490
And tell me, are there monsters in this?

1653
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,270
I need a fucking no.

1654
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,610
Right now.

1655
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:33,650
Is there monsters in this level?

1656
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,150
In this particular level?

1657
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:40,250
Is there monsters?

1658
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:40,650
Is there monsters in this level?

1659
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,070
I don't fucking trust you, Gamble.

1660
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:44,150
You've just been there being like...

1661
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:46,670
Hey, is there scare notifications?

1662
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,770
After you said that, I don't fucking trust you.

1663
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:49,130
Hahaha

1664
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,320
Of course not.

1665
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,700
Smile, no smile.

1666
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:02,400
Hahahahaha They find...

1667
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:02,700
Monsters.

1668
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,400
Am I gonna...

1669
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,980
die when a fucking thing touches me in here.

1670
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:07,840
Like...

1671
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,120
Am I gonna...

1672
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,860
Like not...

1673
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,940
Like I know there's no fucking fall damage anymore.

1674
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,880
Because I'm not inside water now.

1675
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,360
But are there monsters that's gonna touch me.

1676
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:20,340
Touch me and then I'm gonna die.

1677
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:24,260
I hate all of you.

1678
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,200
What if you just don't get caught?

1679
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:32,860
I think the stranger shows up here.

1680
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,160
Water is the truth.

1681
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,240
I hate all of you.

1682
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:38,960
I hate this.

1683
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,560
I fucking hate this.

1684
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,220
Why did I play a scary game at 1 in the morning?

1685
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,660
Why did I do this to myself?

1686
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,320
Okay.

1687
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1688
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:00,860
I... fucking baby.

1689
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:06,160
I stood here for so long, I forgot the baby makes a noise when you climb.

1690
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,060
Oh my god, baby.

1691
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,040
I hate you.

1692
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,880
The way I'm feeling this is spiritual.

1693
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,930
Oh, why is this layers of fear?

1694
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,110
I left layers of fear for baby.

1695
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,450
I fucking hate you, baby.

1696
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,440
You're fine for now?

1697
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,960
For now.

1698
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:57,720
For now.

1699
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,310
Okay, 10 minutes.

1700
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,130
That's like 30 minutes.

1701
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:06,150
Okay, that's good.

1702
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,290
That's like 30 minutes then.

1703
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:21,560
Crawl.

1704
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:22,920
Baby.

1705
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,720
My teddy bear.

1706
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,560
I fucking hate my teddy bear.

1707
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,380
He's fucking useless.

1708
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,800
He's only here to be like, you should be quiet.

1709
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,460
I think there's something wrong.

1710
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:38,840
Oh my god.

1711
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,640
I didn't learn some fear yesterday.

1712
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,100
I've been screaming at almost everything.

1713
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,820
I can get past the fucking staircase, Yumi.

1714
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:58,660
I...

1715
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,560
I thought doors were your alley, you know?

1716
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,220
You had your doors in my car.

1717
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:16,730
Oh yeah, I screamed at the same...

1718
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:16,870
Ah!

1719
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:17,110
Ah!

1720
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:17,430
Ah!

1721
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:26,830
I

1722
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:31,950
hate this.

1723
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,910
I fucking hate this.

1724
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,430
Shoe.

1725
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,970
Fucking shoe!

1726
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,750
Stop fucking... Stop this stupid fucking game.

1727
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:57,950
Fuck this

1728
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:01,500
shoe.

1729
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,440
Actually, fuck this shoe.

1730
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,060
Fuck this shoe.

1731
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,360
I hear my dog's... my dad's dog barking outside for a second.

1732
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,260
I thought she came inside, but it was you screaming at this.

1733
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:18,900
Okay.

1734
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,380
Okay.

1735
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:21,400
Alright.

1736
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:23,700
Alright.

1737
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,180
Chair.

1738
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,220
I'm sorry.

1739
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:28,760
I'm sorry for pushing the chair.

1740
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,960
I am so sorry.

1741
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:53,980
Okay.

1742
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:54,640
We're good.

1743
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,960
That's good enough.

1744
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,640
See, the bear led us here to our doom.

1745
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,440
God.

1746
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,440
I've been enjoying the game.

1747
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,040
I...

1748
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:31,460
I don't know if enjoying is the right word right now.

1749
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,980
I don't know if it's the right word.

1750
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:36,760
Okay.

1751
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,140
I crawl.

1752
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,100
Everything is fine.

1753
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,600
Everything is fine.

1754
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,380
Get me up off this chair.

1755
01:23:59,040 --> 01:23:59,940
What?

1756
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:01,540
I'm sorry!

1757
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,920
I'm so sorry!

1758
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,840
Please!

1759
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,800
I am so sorry!

1760
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,680
I'm so sorry!

1761
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,980
I'm so sorry!

1762
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,840
I'm so sorry!

1763
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:13,780
I'm so sorry!

1764
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,880
I'm so sorry!

1765
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,160
I'm so sorry.

1766
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:49,730
Oh,

1767
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,410
my beard didn't say shit!

1768
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:59,510
The beard didn't say shit!

1769
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:02,530
Stupid fucking beard.

1770
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:10,490
Why does my beard say shit when the monster is here?

1771
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,770
What do I do?

1772
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,260
Please, please, please.

1773
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,340
Please let me in.

1774
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,120
Please, I'm a baby.

1775
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,860
I'm a baby, let me in.

1776
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:41,610
I don't know what to do.

1777
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,130
I don't want to get up.

1778
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:43,970
I don't want to...

1779
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:47,810
I don't want to fucking stand up there anymore.

1780
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:51,210
I'm a baby, let me in.

1781
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:52,030
Please.

1782
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,530
I've been through so much.

1783
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:59,250
I've been through so much, please let me in.

1784
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:03,890
I don't know what to do.

1785
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:07,170
I don't know what to do.

1786
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,270
What the fuck?

1787
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,050
It worked.

1788
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:21,830
It actually let me in.

1789
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,650
What the fuck?

1790
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:27,790
That crazy ass thing.

1791
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:31,270
It gave them so bad for me.

1792
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,350
It gave them so bad for me.

1793
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,560
Look at that.

1794
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:48,660
All you have to do is just cry in front of a door.

1795
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,580
And it opens.

1796
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,180
Oh my god, you're right.

1797
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,300
I tried after that.

1798
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:03,640
Okay.

1799
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:06,540
Okay.

1800
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,960
Do I crawl or stand up?

1801
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,210
I don't want to go anymore.

1802
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:29,030
After I saw that monster.

1803
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:32,090
I don't want to keep going.

1804
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,280
Okay.

1805
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:49,150
Why is it so dark?

1806
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:50,990
Ah!

1807
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,540
Emmet.

1808
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:05,180
He's the one with the gifted sub to Sessala.

1809
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,850
Can we get some bark?

1810
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:11,990
Emmet.

1811
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,650
Oh,

1812
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:25,010
my God, my tracker is bucking up.

1813
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:28,910
Okay.

1814
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:44,170
Down.

1815
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:47,470
Down.

1816
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,270
What is that sound?

1817
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:56,510
No.

1818
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,720
I might be scared.

1819
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,140
Oh god there it is.

1820
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,260
Sorry.

1821
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:50,420
Oh my god.

1822
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,780
So what are you playing?

1823
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:53,700
Pass...

1824
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,600
Phantasm... Okay.

1825
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,300
If I say I'm... Oh no.

1826
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,220
It's so well.

1827
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,780
No it's so well.

1828
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,360
I need to go out.

1829
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,040
I need to go out.

1830
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:12,840
I'm in the rain.

1831
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:15,160
Thank you.

1832
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,760
I hope you had a good stream.

1833
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,380
We were playing... Oh my god.

1834
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,280
Okay.

1835
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:26,200
Ah!

1836
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:27,260
Okay.

1837
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,460

Thank you.

1841

I'm a putter.

1842
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,040
Thank you so much.

1843
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,920
I don't get to show you guys... Oh god.

1844
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:49,140
I am not having a good time right now.

1845

I... Oh god!

1860
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:10,930
What the fuck?

1861
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,760
I hate this.

1862

I have so worried.

1868
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,920
I have so worried about hearts.

1869
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,480

This is the well.

1877
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,020
This is the freaky well.

1878
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:36,980
Ah!

I see someone.

1885
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,720
What is your first impression of a do you have a crisis crime?

1886
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,820
Wanting to die, got to go.

1887
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,000
Oh God, please!

1888
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:54,400
Wait, down?

1889
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,840
Down, down, down!

1890
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,500
Okay,

1892
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:08,500
I thought down was the answer.

1893
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,700

2095
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:28,830
I'm a footer.

2096
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:33,620
No.

2097
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,340
I'm just very scared.

2098
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:39,300
I'm just very, very, very fucking scared right now.

2099
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,600
Okay.

2100
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,540
Why are they knocking?

2101
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:49,280
Why is there knocking?

2102
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:52,660
I'm halfway!

2103
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:59,120
I still have halfway left to the end of this puzzle?

2104
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,000
I'm sorry.

2105
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,540
I'm sorry.

2106
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,040

2107
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,800
I fucking hate this.

2108
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,580
I hate this so much, chat.

2109
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,060
Chat, I want you to know...

2110
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,520
I took my headphones off.

2111
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,020
My headphones are off right now.

2112
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,420
I'm getting...

2113
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,540
I don't want to hear any more knocking.

2114
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,240
I don't want to hear any more knocking.

2115
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:44,960
I'm 80 weak.

2116
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:47,400
Baby's very weak right now.

2117
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:50,520
Okay.

2118
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:00,130
Who's knocking at me?

2119
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:02,210
Okay, how do I get up?

2120
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:03,330
Oh God.

2121
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,450
I fucking hate you guys.

2122
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,210
I hate...

2123
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:09,090
I'm going back in my barrel.

2124
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:11,230
I'm going back in my barrel.

2125
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:12,710
Okay, I'm putting it back on.

2126
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:14,750
I'm putting my headphones back on, chat.

2127
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:15,750

2128
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,530

2129
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:19,850
You guys are making it worse when you're typing the fucking sound.

2130
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:29,150
Fucking...

2131
01:42:29,150 --> 01:42:30,210
I live in barrel.

2132
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:31,170
This is my home.

2133
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:33,110
This is my home now.

2134
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:36,410
I have everything I need.

2135
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:39,030

2136
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,450

01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,470
Please stop knocking.

2139
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,350
Please stop knocking.

2140
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,110

2141
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:48,150
Please stop knocking the door.

2142
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:53,790
Okay.

2143
01:42:54,650 --> 01:42:55,270
Okay.

2144
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:00,260
Alright.

2145
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,020
Baby, go up.

2146
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,740
Oh God.

2147
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:04,780

01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:10,670
Okay.

2150
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:12,850
How do baby go up?

2151
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,270
Baby's strong.

2152
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:16,970
We're barrel people.

2153
01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:18,850
I did.

2154
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:20,230
I put my headphones back on.

2155
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:21,890
I put it back on.

2156
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:23,810
Okay.

2157
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:25,410
Oh God.

2158
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:26,370
That was my shadow.

2159
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:30,710
That was my fucking...

2160
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:31,490
Ah!

2161
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,450

I love you.

2186
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:08,980
I love you.

2187
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:16,400
I love you.

2188
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:16,860
Am I safe?

2189
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:19,140
Am I safe now?

2190
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,260
Am I safe?

2191
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,320
I don't wanna go turn around.

2192
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:36,260
I don't wanna turn around chat.

2193
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,040
Okay.

2194
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:48,480
Turn around... They have to really require you to use... oh yeah, Toshi.

2195
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:53,300
I'm so sad right now.

2196
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,060
I'm so sad.

2197
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,120
I'm so fucking sad.

2198
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:08,140
Koby, thank you so much for the five bits.

2199
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2200
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,200
Baby sad.

2201
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:12,960
Can I come out now?

2202
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,680
Can I turn around now?

2203
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:28,400
I'm barrel.

2204
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,620
I'm barrel baby now.

2205
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,360
I'm barrel baby now.

2206
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,020
I live with the barrel.

2207
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:38,140
Okay.

2208
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:40,680

01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,040
I am... I'm strong berry.

2212
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:56,740

2213
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:00,580
How do I... How do I get out?

2214
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,060
How do I...

2215
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,200
Okay.

2216
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,280
A strong infant baby who don't need... No, I need my bear.

01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:15,880
Okay.

01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:16,840
Fine.

2221
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:25,040
Wait, where...

2222
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,080
Barrel.

2223
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:27,460
Barrel.

2224
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:27,940
Barrel.

2225
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:28,360
Barrel.

2226
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:28,840
A barrel.

2227
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:33,780
Where do I go?

2228
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,320
I don't know where to go.

2229
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,720
Barrel is my only safe spot right now.

2230
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:41,720
Okay.

2231
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:43,280
Okay.

2232
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:44,660
Okay.

2233
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:51,120
Where do I go?

2234
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:51,620
Where do I go?

2235
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:57,410
Where do I go after I get key?

2236
01:46:57,710 --> 01:47:01,390
I don't know where to go after I get key.

2237
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:04,650
I don't wanna go out with the monster.

2238
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,850
I hate this.

2239
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,670
I fucking hate this.

2240
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:13,090
Okay, okay, okay.

2241
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:13,790
Right or left?

2242
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:15,390
Do I go this way?

2243
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:17,190
Or do I go this way?

2244
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:19,150
There's a locked gate?

2245
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,570
There's a locked gate?

2246
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:23,710
Where the fuck's the locked gate?

2247
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:27,910
I think I deleted it.

2248
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:29,570
The memory of the locked gate.

2249
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:32,530
I'm baby lost.

2250
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:35,010
Baby is so lost.

2251
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:38,370
Where the fuck's the locked gate?

2252
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:38,930
Okay.

2253
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:44,670
Which way?

2254
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,090
Where's the gate?

2255
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:49,870
I don't even remember there being a gate.

2256
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,310
When the fuck did I see a gate?

2257
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:56,190
I just go right?

2258
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:58,450
Baby's just gonna go right.

2259
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,650
Oh, right is dead end.

2260
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:09,650
I wanna take off my headphones again till we get there.

2261
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:12,330
Okay.

2262
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,970
When you try to run away near the wall.

2263
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:16,930
Where the fuck?

2264
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:17,690
What wall?

2265
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:19,470
I had to wear walls?

2266
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:20,690
What?

2267
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:22,590
I don't remember shit.

2268
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:26,470
I don't remember what walls.

2269
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:28,290
Oh my god.

2270
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:33,390
Oh my god.

2271
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:37,030
Just because I hate this.

2272
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:38,890
I'm going back inside.

2273
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:44,030
She can't get me here yet.

2274
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:45,310
Oh my god.

2275
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:47,310
I don't know what to do.

2276
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:48,510
I don't...

2277
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:54,760
Okay.

2278
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:55,800
Okay.

2279
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:56,400
Okay.

2280
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:56,700
Okay.

2281
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:56,960
Okay.

2282
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,220
Okay.

2283
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:57,560
Okay.

2284
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,900
I hate this.

2285
01:48:59,080 --> 01:48:59,620
Me.

2286
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:01,160
I hate this.

2287
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,660
I... I hate this so much.

2288
01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:10,140
The wall was... There was spider balls?

2289
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:15,900
I paint the walls.

2290
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:25,530
Where's the wall?

2291
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:26,750
Where's the wall?

2292
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:28,090
Where's the wall?

2293
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:31,750
Where's the wall?

2294
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:38,300
I already did that.

2295
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,360
Yeah, already did that.

2296
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:41,260
Where's the wall?

2297
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:43,360
Do I go... right?

2298
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:44,680
Or forward?

2299
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,280
I don't know forward or way?

2300
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:47,660
But I don't know where to go.

2301
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:48,220
Alex!

2302
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,460
Alex, help me!

2303
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:50,920
I'm so scared, Alex!

2304
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:54,440
Baby must explore!

2305
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,460
No, please don't make baby do...

2306
01:49:57,460 --> 01:49:58,620
Alex, save me!

2307
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,040
Save me from this tree!

2308
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:02,600
Okay, okay, just go forward.

2309
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:10,830
Forward leads to nowhere!

2310
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:12,470
Alex, okay, wait, wait.

2311
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:14,070
Oh no, that's the dead end.

2312
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:15,270
You just...

2313
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:20,630
Forward leads me to nowhere, but I can push.

2314
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:20,830
Push.

2315
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:23,030
Okay.

2316
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:24,610
Okay.

2317
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:26,630
Okay.

2318
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:27,470
Okay.

2319
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:29,430
Wait, I'm AD strafing.

2320
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,610
I'm strafing.

2321
01:50:30,990 --> 01:50:33,050
Okay, where the fuck do I go?

2322
01:50:35,370 --> 01:50:35,690
Push.

2323
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:38,810
I'm okay, I'm safe.

2324
01:50:40,410 --> 01:50:41,250
Okay, chat.

2325
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:51,920
Okay, chat.

2326
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:53,920
Okay, chat.

2327
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,880
Okay, chat.

2328
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:58,180
Barrel, barrel, barrel, barrel.

2329
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,040
Barrel, barrel, barrel, barrel.

2330
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:00,640
Okay.

2331
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:04,640
Barrel.

2332
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:06,020
Oh, oh, ah!

2333
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:15,250
I gotta call the IRL's side of this weird appearance.

2334
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:16,410
We miss you, Alex!

2335
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:18,210
We miss you.

2336
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:24,270
Am I going the right way?

2337
01:51:24,930 --> 01:51:28,350
Guys, please tell me I'm going the right way.

2338
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:31,890
Because if I am not going the fucking right way, I'm going the right way.

2339
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:34,890
Left?!

2340
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:42,420
Left?

2341
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,820
Left is ocean.

2342
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,880
Left is...

2343
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,120
Left is ocean.

2344
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,160
Where the fuck am I going?

2345
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,140
Hole?

2346
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:03,430
Can I go through hole?

2347
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,170
No, I don't...

2348
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:05,270
I...

2349
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:14,750
I don't know where.

2350
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:17,570
I don't know where to go.

2351
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:20,670
I may be lost.

2352
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:22,530
I don't know where.

2353
01:52:24,850 --> 01:52:26,490
Maybe he don't know where.

2354
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:29,630
Maybe he just wants to stop.

2355
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,320
Okay.

2356
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,560
Am I going the right way?

2357
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:41,360
Oh,

2358
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:46,460
which way do we go?

2359
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:49,340
Chad, please help me!

2360
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:52,820
I don't want to explore anymore!

2361
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:59,480
I don't want to explore, please!

2362
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:04,100
Please, I don't want to explore anymore!

2363
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:10,460
This is like he take baby, put baby on back and carry me off.

2364
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,340
Hahaha!

2365
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:16,220
Hydra Mom!

2366
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:19,020
Why did you have to give it a name?

2367
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,280
Why did you have to?

2368
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,820
Why did you have to give her a name?

2369
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:25,820
That makes it worse!

2370
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,900
Why did you have to give Hydra Mom a name?

2371
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:34,700
I just wanted to call her the what the fuck.

2372
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:40,580
Please, put baby on back and tell her where baby go.

2373
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,820
I can't.

2374
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:42,640
I don't want to go.

2375
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:43,440
I don't want to explore anymore.

2376
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:50,040
Fucking, fucking, fucking backseat me so hard, please.

2377
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:50,820
Hahaha!

2378
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,840
Like, what the, what the fuck, Mom?

2379
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:57,920
Hahaha!

2380
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,840
Her name is Lady of the Forest.

2381
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:09,160
Baby's gonna be in bush forever if someone does not fucking take up the backseat gaming.

2382
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:10,060
Hahaha!

2383
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:10,500
Hahaha!

2384
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,100
Go for it and go, right?

2385
01:54:16,140 --> 01:54:19,540
If you can't see them, they can't, I don't think that's the right logic.

2386
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,960
I don't think, I don't think, hahaha!

2387
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,800
I don't think that's, that's the right logic here.

2388
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:27,540
Hahaha!

2389
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,700
Let's go right?

2390
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:34,830
We've been here.

2391
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:37,330
Baby's been here though.

2392
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,060
Baby been right?

2393
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:47,480
Baby, baby, baby scared.

2394
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:48,480
Baby scared!

2395
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:49,580
What was that?

2396
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,440
Can't see me if I'm in the bush.

2397
01:54:57,340 --> 01:54:58,500
Can't see me.

2398
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:07,180
Branch.

2399
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,920
Why the fuck can I carry a branch now?

2400
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,460
What is this branch gonna do?

2401
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,940
What is this branch gonna do?

2402
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,140
Baby have weapon?

2403
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:28,780
Baby have weapon.

2404
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:33,460
Okay.

2405
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,880
Alright, any backseat gamers in chat?

2406
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:38,120
Please, please backseat.

2407
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:40,960
Please, I just, I just wanna get out of here.

2408
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:41,860
Hahaha!

2409
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:45,040
I've been stuck here for so long.

2410
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:45,900
Hahaha!

2411
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:50,980
I just don't, I don't wanna keep, I don't wanna go the wrong way.

2412
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,200
Oh, that's what made the noise.

2413
01:56:11,810 --> 01:56:13,350
That's so fucking stupid.

2414
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:16,570
Oh, branch gone.

2415
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:19,390
Oh no, branch gone.

2416
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:20,610
Hahaha!

2417
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:24,470
Okay.

2418
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:26,290
Okay.

2419
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:27,610
Okay.

2420
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,990
Okay.

2421
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,400
My mind's gone.

2422
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:37,700
Yeah, Lancer's right, my mind's gone too.

2423
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,280
My mind's gone already.

2424
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:40,880
What you playing?

2425
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,680
What you, what you, what you, what you playing?

2426
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:43,400
Hahaha!

2427
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:50,640
I hope she won't, I, you know, I don't even fucking, I can't even trust chat anymore.

2428
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:57,900
I can't even fucking trust you guys when you say, when you're like, don't worry, the monster's gone already.

2429
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,760
You don't have to worry about anything.

2430
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:07,340
And then fucking, you're like, don't worry guys, there's no monster in this, in this level, you're fine.

2431
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:10,720
And now you guys are like, don't worry, the monster's gone.

2432
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:13,840
I don't think I can trust you guys anymore after that.

2433
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:15,120
Hahaha!

2434
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,220
Okay.

2435
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:22,060
Need some, oh god, I need more than just brain cells.

2436
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:25,620
Okay, I'm taking my, shit, fuck this, I'm taking my headphones off.

2437
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:30,060
Fuck this, if I'm gonna have to deal with a monster, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to explore this by myself.

2438
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:34,340
I'm gonna fucking, I'm fucking, I'm fucking taking my headphones off.

2439
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,060
Headphones off now.

2440
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,000
Headphones off.

2441
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,100
I'm about to explore this by myself.

2442
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,960
Fucking taking my headphones off.

2443
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,600
Oh my god.

2444
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,300
I won't even know if the monster's gonna come out.

2445
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:49,740
I can't even hear shit!

2446
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:50,900
Hahaha!

2447
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:54,200
Can't hear shit!

2448
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:55,660
Can't hear, hurt me!

2449
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:56,660
Wooo!

2450
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,320
Oh, there it is.

2451
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,780
All I have to do is just take my headphones off.

2452
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:01,440
Hahaha!

2453
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:08,260
What?

2454
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,600
Monster's behind me?

2455
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:10,900
You think I give a fuck?

2456
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:11,800
Yeah!

2457
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,660
I don't care, I can even stand.

2458
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:14,500
Ho-ho-ho!

2459
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,160
Ho-ho!

2460
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:16,840
Ha-ha-ha,

2461
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:28,180

2462
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,080
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

2463
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,320
A-ha-ha-ha!

2464
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:37,380
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

2465
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,460
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

2466
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:41,740
Ssh!

2467
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:44,780
My god.

2468
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:45,580
Whoa!

2469
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,260
I hate all of you!

2470
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:59,840
Oh don't worry, the monster is gone.

2471
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,400
You can fucking explore the forest.

2472
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:10,940
I was like, yeah I'm not scared.

2473
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,760
I can stand on them too.

2474
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:16,820
I'm not scared.

2475
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:17,500
I'm not scared.

2476
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,120
Oh my god.

2477
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:29,200
I can't fucking believe it.

2478
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:32,360
Oh my god.

2479
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:39,040
Oh my god.

2480
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,240
I fucking can't believe that.

2481
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,880
I was like, yeah look at me.

2482
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:48,260
I can stand up too.

2483
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:51,780
Oh my god.

2484
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:00,810
Holy shit.

2485
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:02,650
I hate all of you.

2486
02:00:06,290 --> 02:00:07,510
Okay, okay.

2487
02:00:08,210 --> 02:00:12,330
Alright, well now I know what the fuck's gonna happen after that.

2488
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:17,390
Okay, is there a way to avoid this monster?

2489
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:20,350
Where the fuck am I?

2490
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:24,250
Okay.

2491
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:28,250
Do I just have to get the key or do the key thing really fucking fast?

2492
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:29,710
Is that it?

2493
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:30,950
Is that all I have to do?

2494
02:00:32,430 --> 02:00:33,110
Is that all?

2495
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:34,970
I'm not gonna put my headphones back on after that.

2496
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:37,990
If I die, I die I guess.

2497
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:43,610
Do I just have to like run super fast and then plug the key in and that's all?

2498
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:46,030
Please, please chat.

2499
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:49,290
Yes, of course this is...

2500
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:50,870
We've been lost here for so long.

2501
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:53,930
For like 30 minutes we've been stuck in this fucking one level.

2502
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:55,430
For 30 minutes.

2503
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:57,990
Of course this is the fucking first time.

2504
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:01,570
Okay.

2505
02:01:02,370 --> 02:01:05,750
So I just have to do the thing very fast because I'm not doing this like 20 times.

2506
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:08,790
If you guys are fucking giving me... Okay, which way though?

2507
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:10,010
I forgot I fucking got lost already.

2508
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:12,030
Okay.

2509
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:12,930
Okay.

2510
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:14,090
Baby fast.

2511
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:16,290
Baby fast.

2512
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:17,530
Baby fast.

2513
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:17,830
Baby fast.

2514
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:20,410
Baby fast.

2515
02:01:21,150 --> 02:01:22,010
Baby fast.

2516
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:23,450
Baby fast.

2517
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:24,550
Baby please.

2518
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:25,450
Baby please.

2519
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:27,070
You gotta be faster than that baby.

2520
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:28,670
You gotta be faster than that baby.

2521
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:29,470
Please baby.

2522
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:30,270
Baby.

2523
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:30,810
Please.

2524
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:31,530
Baby.

2525
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:32,150
Baby.

2526
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:33,810
Baby's tied up.

2527
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:34,190
Baby.

2528
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:42,810
Why can't I open this?

2529
02:01:42,990 --> 02:01:43,450
Baby!

2530
02:01:44,250 --> 02:01:44,770
Baby!

2531
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:52,480
Baby!

2532
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,240
Baby!

2533
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,680
Oh god.

2534
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:00,940
Baby.

2535
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:01,540
Baby.

2536
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,440
Baby just keep running.

2537
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,020
Baby.

2538
02:02:03,180 --> 02:02:03,960
Just keep running.

2539
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,260
I don't know where to run.

2540
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,280
Baby just...

2541
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:07,300
Baby.

2542
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,020
Baby.

2543
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:09,620
Baby.

2544
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:10,540
Baby.

2545
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,180
Oh god.

2546
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,700
Just keep running.

2547
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:15,300
Oh.

2548
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:15,940

02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:27,880
Baby.

2555
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:28,400
Baby stop.

2556
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:29,160
Stop crawling.

2557
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:29,720
Please.

2558
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:30,780
Just stop crawling.

2559
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:31,560
Just get out.

2560
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,800
Just get out.

2561
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:36,120
Baby.

2562
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,780
Just get the fuck out.

2563
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:38,220

2564
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:39,960
Please.

2565
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:40,900
Guys.

2566
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:43,580
Baby did it.

2567
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:48,260
Baby did it.

2568
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:51,640
Baby did it.

2569
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:53,740
Baby did it.

2570
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:56,640
Baby sit down for a sec.

2571
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:59,000
Baby's just gonna sit down.

2572
02:02:59,020 --> 02:02:59,520
Sit down for a sec.

2573
02:02:59,540 --> 02:02:59,760
Chat.

2574
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,240
I just... I just sit down for a sec.

2575
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:10,760
I sit down for a sec.

2576
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,200
Baby Baby overcome some fear.

2577
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,740
Oh my god.

2578
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:24,740
I hate...

2579
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:26,520
Baby.

2580
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:28,060
Baby's just vibing right now.

2581
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:35,180
Okay, time to put the last puzzle piece.

2582
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,460
Oh god.

2583
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,200
God I hate you so much baby.

2584
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:43,740
I fucking hate you so much.

2585
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,660
The last level.

2586
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:51,300
The last one.

2587
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:51,420
Come on.

2588
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:02,670
Is this last monster gonna chase me too?

2589
02:04:04,610 --> 02:04:07,130
Is the last monster gonna chase me too?

2590
02:04:14,490 --> 02:04:16,110
I need to know.

2591
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:22,110
The dress code in the beginning probably.

2592
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:33,520
To be fair to me, the previous monster didn't chase you.

2593
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:35,820
More like it snuck up on you.

2594
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:40,220
Oh my god.

2595
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:44,560
How the fuck... Oh my god I hate this.

2596
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:47,380
I hate this.

2597
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:55,620
Alright, how's this painting gonna change?

2598
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:57,520
How are you gonna change?

2599
02:04:57,820 --> 02:04:59,480
Oh my god.

2600
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:02,140
Oh my god.

2601
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:05,820
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2602
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,440
Why do you not have a face?

2603
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:09,820
Where the fuck's your face?

2604
02:05:21,650 --> 02:05:22,470
I don't...

2605
02:05:23,150 --> 02:05:25,310
I don't know if I can keep doing this guys.

2606
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:28,850
I don't know if I...

2607
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:30,850
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

2608
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:34,210
I think...

2609
02:05:35,710 --> 02:05:36,230
Chat...

2610
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:38,570
I think...

2611
02:05:38,570 --> 02:05:40,230
I think I'm gonna...

2612
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:42,010
I'm gonna end stream here.

2613
02:05:42,010 --> 02:05:42,650
I can't.

2614
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:44,090
I...

2615
02:05:44,090 --> 02:05:44,350
I...

2616
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:45,490
I can't dude.

2617
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:52,130
This last 20 minutes.

2618
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:59,070
20 minutes of hell.

2619
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,270
20 minutes of hell.

2620
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:06,950
Okay.

2621
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:09,390
Oh my god.

2622
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:11,710
We believe in you.

2623
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:13,890
I don't believe in myself though guys.

2624
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:15,110
I...

2625
02:06:15,490 --> 02:06:17,850
I don't believe in myself chat.

2626
02:06:22,810 --> 02:06:24,590
Just take off my clothes.

2627
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:31,610
Just revert to Ooga Booga mode like you did.

2628
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:33,050
I was like Ooga Booga mode.

2629
02:06:33,190 --> 02:06:35,130
It's gonna help me here in stream.

2630
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:37,570
Okay.

2631
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:38,910
Okay.

2632
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,210
Okay.

2633
02:06:41,710 --> 02:06:42,710
I hate this.

2634
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:51,920
20 minutes of hell.

2635
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,960
It's kinda funny.

2636
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:53,900
Okay.

2637
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:54,500
How about this chat?

2638
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:54,840
We finish.

2639
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:00,520
We'll do another 3 hour stream for this game next stream.

2640
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:01,940
How about that guys?

2641
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:03,760
Is that better?

2642
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,020
Can we double that?

2643
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:07,000
I can't.

2644
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:08,920
I'm looking into this fucking...

2645
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,440
I'm looking into this void right now.

2646
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:12,640

And I can't.

2734
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:33,190
They put me in a maze.

2735
02:11:33,450 --> 02:11:36,030
I'm in a fucking maze right now, Stupa.

2736
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:38,190

02:12:45,330 --> 02:12:46,290

2760
02:12:46,670 --> 02:12:48,870

02:12:56,430 --> 02:12:59,330
Like I said, fucking co- don't worry, it's just a code man.

2765
02:12:59,570 --> 02:13:05,030
Don't worry, the sea monster girl, the fucking, what's her name, Hydra mom is not gonna get you anymore, she's gone!

2766
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,270

Oh my god.

2769
02:13:14,970 --> 02:13:16,410
Okay, I don't go straight.

2770
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:17,870
What I've learned...

2771
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:19,650
is that...

2772
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:21,650
I just don't go straight.

2773
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:25,510
Can someone fucking back the game for me?

2774
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:27,810
Okay.

2775
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:39,720
Alright, so apparently...

2776
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:43,100
I don't go straight.

2777
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,480
Apparently...

2778
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:49,960
Yeah, I meant my daily, I'll do that later.

2779
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:52,160
I need to process this first.

2780
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:56,300
Oh my god.

2781
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:57,860
Which way do I go?

2782
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:00,120
If I don't go straight, I guess left?

2783
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,900
Okay, I need to go left.

2784
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:04,500
And then Hydra mom's in front of me.

2785
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:06,280
Okay.

2786
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,480
Alright.

2787
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:11,740

2788
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:13,320

2789
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:15,980

2790
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:17,860
Oh, doot doot doot!

2791
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:19,220
Doot doot doot!

2792
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:20,900
Please!

2793
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:24,880
Where am I going?

2794
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:26,740
Where am I going?

2795
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:29,460
Where am I going?

2796
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:30,440
Where am I going?

2797
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:41,280
I can't hear anything!

2798
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:43,620
I can't hear anything!

2799
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:45,640
Let me through!

2800
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:47,000
Let me through!

2801
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,480
Oh, I won't let me through!

2802
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:51,140
Please let me through!

2803
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:53,360
Oh, people!

2804
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:55,380
Doot doot doot!

2805
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:56,560
Doot doot doot!

2806
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:58,880
Bed, bed, bed, bed!

2807
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:00,960
It can't kill me if I'm under bed!

2808
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:01,400
Oh!

2809
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:11,420
It can't kill me if I'm under bed!

2810
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,120
Please just leave.

2811
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:19,440
They gave me 100 beds, people!

2812
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:25,550
The fuck do I go?

2813
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:32,330
Okay, I'm just gonna stay here for a bit, guys.

2814
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,750
Okay.

2815
02:15:35,250 --> 02:15:37,030
I don't know where to go after this.

2816
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:40,990
I don't know where to go after this.

2817
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:43,550
Where the fuck do I go?

2818
02:15:43,870 --> 02:15:44,770
Where the fuck?

2819
02:15:45,290 --> 02:15:46,450
Where the fuck do I go?

2820
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:50,270
I have to go back out.

2821
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,370
Okay, let me...

2822
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:52,350
I'm just gonna...

2823
02:15:52,350 --> 02:15:54,990
I'm just gonna drink water real quick, guys.

2824
02:15:57,890 --> 02:15:59,890
I'm just gonna sit in my water.

2825
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:03,290
For a second while I process what to do after.

2826
02:16:07,110 --> 02:16:08,170
We live here.

2827
02:16:08,230 --> 02:16:09,090
This is my home now.

2828
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:11,370
Barrel is not my home anymore.

2829
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:13,470
This is my home now.

2830
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:15,450
I've upgraded from barrels.

2831
02:16:15,730 --> 02:16:17,050
From the barrel home.

2832
02:16:17,890 --> 02:16:18,890
I've upgraded.

2833
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:20,670
Okay.

2834
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,090
Okay.

2835
02:16:25,710 --> 02:16:27,470
Barrel baby's in bed, baby!

2836
02:16:27,670 --> 02:16:29,430
I'm bed baby now, guys.

2837
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:32,010
I'm bed baby now.

2838
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:35,090
I'm bed baby now.

2839
02:16:35,090 --> 02:16:35,650
END IT!

2840
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:36,410
END IT!

2841
02:16:36,510 --> 02:16:38,110
Jericho, where do I go, Jericho?

2842
02:16:38,330 --> 02:16:39,770
Fucking just tell me where to go.

2843
02:16:43,850 --> 02:16:45,250
Jericho just tell me where to go.

2844
02:16:45,410 --> 02:16:45,490
Jericho just tell me where to go.

2845
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:46,830
You know how to end this.

2846
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:51,070
You know how to end this, Jericho.

2847
02:16:58,390 --> 02:16:59,410
I don't want to go.

2848
02:16:59,430 --> 02:17:00,110
I don't want to go out.

2849
02:17:00,390 --> 02:17:01,250
I don't want to go.

2850
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:04,310
This is freaking fucking...

2851
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:21,370
Let me breathe in.

2852
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:24,190
Okay.

2853
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:25,670
It's time.

2854
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:29,270
Oh my god, I hate you guys.

2855
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:40,280
Okay.

2856
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:06,740
I'm going back.

2857
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:07,920
I'm going back.

2858
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:10,280
I'm going back because I don't know where to go.

2859
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:12,900
I'm going back because I don't know where to go.

2860
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,100
Oh god, please.

2861
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:18,720
It's over here.

2862
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:20,520
That's it, right?

2863
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:21,840
Over there, right?

2864
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:23,700
It's over there, right?

2865
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:27,200
I see it.

2866
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:28,220
I see it.

2867
02:18:30,960 --> 02:18:31,440
I see it.

2868
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:35,600
Do

2869
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:42,800
do do.

2870
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:43,760
Do do do.

2871
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:44,580
Do do do.

2872
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:44,780
Do do do.

2873
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:45,120
Do do do.

2874
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,660
Next memory.

2875
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:46,220
Next memory.

2876
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:47,100
Fucking run.

2877
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:47,720
Fucking run.

2878
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:50,800
Oh god.

2879
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:51,980
Oh fuck you.

2880
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:57,080
Oh my god.

2881
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,840
A rabbit cried and cried.

2882
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,520
He cried so much.

2883
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:07,280
And his tears filled the bottom of the well.

2884
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:08,480
That was me.

2885
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:14,740
Give me that fucking book.

2886
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:16,820
Give me that book.

2887
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:22,020
Where the fuck am I?

2888
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,860
Why is it sunny now?

2889
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:25,080
Stop.

2890
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:27,480
Oh god.

2891
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:28,840
Let me in.

2892
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:33,520
God, bring me back.

2893
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:34,900
Bring me back home.

2894
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:38,980
Oh my god.

2895
02:19:43,210 --> 02:19:44,090
Oh my god.

2896
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,570
We're back.

2897
02:19:44,770 --> 02:19:46,530
Get the fuck in my hand right now.

2898
02:19:47,130 --> 02:19:48,890
Get in my hand.

2899
02:19:51,970 --> 02:19:53,450
Oh baby, he's back.

2900
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:56,430
What was that?

2901
02:19:56,670 --> 02:19:57,350
That thing?

2902
02:19:57,350 --> 02:19:58,150
What was that thing?

2903
02:19:58,190 --> 02:19:59,310
Shut the fuck up, bear.

2904
02:19:59,590 --> 02:20:00,350
You didn't know.

2905
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:01,630
Oh, he's there.

2906
02:20:01,750 --> 02:20:03,890
She seems so sad and desperate.

2907
02:20:04,710 --> 02:20:07,770
All this bear did was give me fucking depression.

2908
02:20:08,010 --> 02:20:09,130
What the fuck?

2909
02:20:11,190 --> 02:20:12,030
He's just there.

2910
02:20:12,030 --> 02:20:12,910
He's never be like, you go.

2911
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:14,710
You did it, child.

2912
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:16,010
Good job.

2913
02:20:16,270 --> 02:20:17,110
No, he's just like, man.

2914
02:20:17,550 --> 02:20:19,010
That lady was so sad.

2915
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:22,030
Oh my god.

2916
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:26,210
Oh my god.

2917
02:20:26,950 --> 02:20:27,650
I know.

2918
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:28,630
Alright.

2919
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:30,330
Time to close.

2920
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:41,300
I saw you play spooky stuff and never clicked the Discord link that...

2921
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:42,240
Oh, Vic, I'm so sorry.

2922
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:43,340
We're about to...

2923
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:46,720
We just finished our last level today.

2924
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,280
Yeah, we're finishing.

2925
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:52,100
I'm not going through another level right now.

2926
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:54,380
It's fucking 4 AM, chat.

2927
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:56,980
It's 4 AM.

2928
02:20:58,450 --> 02:21:00,480
Bear, I'm not fucking pushing that fucking button.

2929
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:01,900
Alright.

2930
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,420
We're gonna...

2931
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:09,140
I'm just gonna sit down for a sec, guys.

2932
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:10,180
Okay.

2933
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:11,260
No.

2934
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:12,320
No, we're gonna...

2935
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,660
I'm finishing this game next stream.

2936
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,600
There is no fucking way.

2937
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:17,920
I'm just gonna keep going.

2938
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:20,960
Because there's still the memory and...

2939
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:21,880
And, like...

2940
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,880
A level after...

2941
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:25,100
Don't fucking fuck with me.

2942
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:26,720
I know there's a level after the memory.

2943
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:30,040
You think I don't know there's a level after the memory?

2944
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:31,960
Don't fuck with me.

2945
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:34,900
I might be baby.

2946
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:39,140
But I know there's a level after the fucking memory.

2947
02:21:42,580 --> 02:21:43,540
She's cheating.

2948
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:44,720
You know how I know?

2949
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:46,580
Because there's no way it's gonna end.

2950
02:21:46,580 --> 02:21:48,120
When you're getting all the memories.

2951
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:50,220
And being like, congratulations, you got all the memories.

2952
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:51,200
And then, bam!

2953
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:51,920
Boss level.

2954
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,180
You think I don't know that shit?

2955
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:58,360
You think I don't fucking know that shit?

2956
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:02,980
Alright, guys.

2957
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:04,780
I'm not gonna end right away.

2958
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:06,300
I'll do the Q&A session.

2959
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:09,000
I'm gonna do the Q&A session.

2960
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,260
So, you know what?

2961
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:12,620
I'm just gonna fucking...

2962
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:13,780
I'm leaving.

2963
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,500
I'm leaving.

2964
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:15,400
I'm gonna be right back, chat.

2965
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:15,840
You got no clarifiedutes you got?

2966
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:17,960
You're not allowed to be on here.
