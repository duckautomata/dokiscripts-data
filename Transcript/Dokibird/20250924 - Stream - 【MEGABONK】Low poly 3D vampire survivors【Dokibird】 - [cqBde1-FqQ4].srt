00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
Hello, hello everybody!

2
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,340
If you are here right now, you didn't get raptured!

3
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,520
And you're now stuck with me forever!

4
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,240
That's right, you committed the biggest sin!

5
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,500
Watching an anime VTuber and it's too late to stop now!

6
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,700
Yay!

7
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,860
Wait, wait, wait.

8
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,780
That's right!

9
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,760
You didn't get raptured.

10
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,000
You're here.

11
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,620
You're still here.

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,140
And it's so wrong.

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,160
And why does it feel so right?

14
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:40,920
Oh, yeah, for those who are very confused right now, apparently, there's been an on Christian TikTok.

15
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,840
I know, wild.

16
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,040
But people were.

17
00:02:47,060 --> 00:04:08,440
saying that people were predicting today is the day where all the all the good people will get raptured so like leading up to today people were posting tiktoks about like what do you do when you get raptured tips on how to handle the rapture and and then um it was supposed to happen at like around 11 30 a.m or some shit and people were like people were like trying to be like oh it's because they're doing it one at a time so it's gonna take a while to like get there because they're like they're like wait why are we getting raptured right now it's being like oh don't worry it's just taking they're just doing it one at a time uh so it's just very slow you know it's not an instant rapture there's a queue yeah there's a fucking line right now for the rapture but no you did it you're stuck here you you committed sin so now you're here and all you can do is just watch me yeah you weren't special enough i knew i wasn't getting raptured i did a lot i we all got left i i knew i wasn't like i i

18
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:20,280
was ready to stream today I was like, okay, to be fair, I was debating whether or not to stream today because, um, because I was, uh, I was very tired.

19
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,000
I had a really bad sleep today.

20
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,540
Um, so, because I don't know, I went to bed around like 10 in the morning because I couldn't fall asleep.

21
00:04:28,640 --> 00:05:30,180
I also had like, it was very stressful because like, um, uh, I had, there was like sponsor issues because, uh, because I know some people were like, oh, I'm just supposed to do a collab for your sponsor, stuff happened and um Nikolai partner had to pull up because like some personal stuff happened so like throughout that time I think like I had to be awake to figure out like oh like I had to find like a backup plan being like oh my gosh like who else can we bring in like this last minute like for tomorrow because it's like one of the sponsors we it was planned for a while now um so we're like fuck okay we gotta figure out like can we bring someone over this last minute and also take the same amount of payment that the my letter collab partner took and so like um it was hard because like uh we couldn't we had to figure this out within last night so i was awake till seven in the morning trying to figure out a solution and in the end um um we're uh we're like can i just do it solo and

22
00:05:30,180 --> 00:06:27,120
because like we can't like it was either this or i or i joined another group but like I felt so awkward because there were some people that I've never collabed with before or like really had an interaction before so I didn't want to like I didn't want to have like an awkward collab situation where I forced myself onto of another group like just join them like last minute so they're like oh so we're just like okay how about I just do a solo and they're like you know yeah fuck it it's it's so there wasn't there's not a lot of stuff we could do about it so uh so i don't want me a new person via sponsor you know i rather get to know a person before i like do a sponsor with them so i rather just meet i rather have that interaction first um so and i didn't want to force them to be like hey hey here's jokie bird remember when you're supposed to do a collab with one person you got collab with her too and i felt like that would be so awkward So I was just like,

23
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,300
but I'll just do it solo.

24
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,860
Because we have to figure this out late at night.

25
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,160
And at that point, everyone's asleep, you know, because it's NA hours.

26
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,080
But like, obviously, like, the client wasn't NA.

27
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,840
So, like, for them, they're all awake.

28
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,460
But for me, it's, like, everyone's asleep.

29
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,600
So I couldn't grab something.

30
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Like, I can, like, message somebody late at night and be like, can you do it?

31
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,760
And then, you know, all the legal stuff as well.

32
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,860
So now I was just like, okay.

33
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,240
And then after that, I was just so stressed out about that.

34
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,320
That was like tossing and turning to like 10, I think like 10 in the morning.

35
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,840
And then like, and then I went to sleep.

36
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,620
I went to bed.

37
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,900
And I think I woke up around basically at like 3.30 p.m.

38
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,080
Because I was just, my brain was just too, at that point my brain was just too active.

39
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,480
So I couldn't go to bed.

40
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,200
So I was like, oh fuck, do I stream?

41
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,040
It's so late already.

42
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,560
You know, I was like, oh, I didn't make, I didn't post my schedule.

43
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,000
So like, it would be so last minute.

44
00:07:24,340 --> 00:08:54,920
day I have to I need people because that'll be like what did people think I got raptured like I was just like I can't do that I need people to know if i haven't got right if you know that I'm still here I so so I was like I got a stream today or people won't know they need to know that I'm still here so I was stream something today it would be what do you mean it would be crazy if i did get raptured hello at least i didn't murder anyone i've always i've always repented i looked at my mini confessional and be like please forgive me like where is that supposed to mean i could have been raptured not that bad of a person i i didn't murder anyone yet uh whoever yes thank you for the magenta soup but thank you thank you worth it next thing thank you super chat thank you thank you i say this is better than heaven but probably change my mind by a time we're an hour in thank you for the super chat thank you thank you uh uh see luca thank you the magenta soup but thank you thank you has to just

45
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,540
enjoy Halo.

46
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,740
Halo 2 is so good, but rage-inducing is to go same level as New Vegas.

47
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,760
No, I haven't played Halo 2 yet, but I definitely did enjoy Halo 1.

48
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,480
We'll go back to Halo 2 soon.

49
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:17,340
I just, also, like, thinking about it, I think, like, started, after I finished Sleeping Dogs, we're just gonna commit to one series a week.

50
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,740
Doing two series, just too much.

51
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,220
Because I keep forgetting.

52
00:09:22,620 --> 00:10:29,260
I keep having to remember trolls because I have to like finish like do two series at once so I'm gonna like do one series so I thought to be fair I was doing one series a week until like Holland night came up and his silk song came up so then like it's sort of like messed up my entire like rhythm so it's easier for me to focus on one series a week this time um but definitely yeah definitely after after when if we finish leaping dogs that's where we're pivoting to and then we could just do like random stuff in between um what else do i want to say um oh yeah apparently silent hill early access came out i'm guys remember i'm not playing until a million subscribers but um so i still have a lot of time i might have until like next halloween uh but i heard about i was watching i watched a little bit up Silent Hill F and um and I I from because like uh Charlie was playing it's like it was it just popped up in my on my twitch feed so I was like I'll check it out just to see I didn't really

53
00:10:29,260 --> 00:11:16,740
get spoiled I just wanted to see how it looks it definitely feels a lot different than um the Silent Hill 2 remastered it apparently it's more so Japanese horror because it's all set in Japan so it focused and then apparently people were saying it's the dark souls of they were saying they were saying it's the dark souls of silent hill because there's like dodge mechanics now so like you can actually like iframe dodges and so and i was like that's pretty funny i it was yeah like um like apparently there's i frames when you're dodging in silent hill f so they're like it's the dark souls of silent hill and you can you can roll Oh my god,

54
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,640
you can roll.

55
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,160
That's crazy.

56
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,420
Yeah, you can eye-frame your jump scares now.

57
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:33,280
But, uh, but everyone, but it is a lot, it is, it's a lot, I don't know if I say it a lot scarier.

58
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,160
I was watching it a little bit.

59
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,340
Uh, but, uh, oh, you cat roll.

60
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,020
Someone was like, you can roll.

61
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,100
I was like, wait, you cat?

62
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,280
I just saw her dodging.

63
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,720
I didn't realize.

64
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,200
It's just more so of like, shimmy, shimmy dodges.

65
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,920
But it looks, it's a lot different.

66
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,080
It's a lot different from Silent Hill 2 Remastered.

67
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,420
Because I think it's like, it's different developers too, I'm pretty sure, right?

68
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,380
Because like Silent Hill 2 Remastered came from that painting horror game developer.

69
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,440
I don't remember what they're called.

70
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,460
The one that did the painting, the scary painting game.

71
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,620
And then Silent Hill, this Silent Hill F was developed by in Japan.

72
00:12:16,000 --> 00:13:31,100
like by the um what's the word called by the um you know i don't know what it's called like back back in the core development team in the in the core development i think bluebird team did only did the remaster so it was uh sorry like i said my brain is really tired right now because i didn't have a really good oh it's a chinese developer i thought it was in japan um okay it wasn't yeah I thought oh it was still yeah I was gonna say I thought it was it was a Japanese development team because it's based in uh jap like it's based in like Japanese lore and uh based in Japanese lore and the writer of the game was by when they cry so I didn't realize it was Chinese developer team so I guess they also outsourged it to a different uh development team then um but it I don't know it doesn't look that scary to me because like that's because like silent hill uh two fucking freaks me out um it was like it was it like gave me goosebumps and i actually had like had like uh my heart was just beating

73
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:48,200
so fucking fast when i was playing silent hill too but when i was watched but then i'm like saying i'm watching it watching it is different from actually playing it as we all know um because we're like oh when you're watching something hey it's not that scary but when you're actually playing it it's like freaking freaky but i'm not sure i I think it's also because it's not as dark.

74
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,600
I think that's it.

75
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,040
Because like when you're, but then she's like mostly, even when she was inside, it didn't seem like she was in a dark environment.

76
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,520
While in Silent Hill 2, I felt like, I was like, where the fuck am I?

77
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,020
Like, I felt like I'm always shining my flashlights everywhere.

78
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,100
I was like, where am I?

79
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,380
I was like, where is this?

80
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,940
I can't see, I can't see within one meter.

81
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,460
Like, I look up, I'm like, where is this?

82
00:14:16,000 --> 00:15:37,020
like when I was watching Silent Hill F I was like wow I can see everything like I'm like wow it's not just pitch black holy fuck like so so I feel like that's promising for me because that means I won't be like extra freaked out um um but yeah uh it seems really fun people were saying very different so if you did enjoy the Silent Hill franchise um you might not like the newest game only because it's not very faithful to like the original it's not based it's not like the original mechanics of the it doesn't follow the usual formula of a Silent Hill game so people were just saying like oh um it is new you might not like it because it is new like it's following a new um and uh and like uh just new there's a new way of playing silent hill so i think that's very interesting simple-minded thank you for the super chat thank you thank you doki no offense but you get raptured then there's a good chance everyone in chat would hey i have i have a secret murderer i don't okay okay if you're okay i

83
00:15:37,020 --> 00:16:17,640
shouldn't say that but uh but if you are a secret murderer watching my please turn yourself in please turn yourself in oh I'm sorry you I do not I'm sorry if you're a dragoon I'm so I have legally I have to disown you as a drag I really don't want to be connected to any crimes legally I will have to call the cops on you I do not want to be associated with any murderers but thank you for the super chat thank you thank you black fire welcome Thank you for the five gifts and chips.

84
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,100
Thank you.

85
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,660
Thank you.

86
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,940
Thank you.

87
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,660
She was a fan of you first thing.

88
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,020
I am not defending a murderer.

89
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,220
I would get like X amount.

90
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm not going to be on the news being like, beach.

91
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,180
I swear to God.

92
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:39,500
If you are a murderer and you get caught, before you get caught, burn all your Doki merch.

93
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,620
I am not getting on the news because you were a Doki Bird fan.

94
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,980
I am not going to be.

95
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm like, we've uncovered a JokieB championship, like we've uncovered this, and these anime Vtuber merch in the suspects.

96
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,280
I don't do this to me.

97
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,060
Don't, don't, don't fucking do this to me.

98
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,520
I, this is not, you don't wanna say all exposure is good.

99
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,500
This is not good exposure.

100
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,380
This is not good.

101
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,920
If you are a JokieBrie fan and you commit murder, Burn all your... Just throw it away.

102
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,720
Throw it away.

103
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,400
I am not getting on the news.

104
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,520
This is not the reason why I want to get on the news.

105
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,060
I do not want this.

106
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,100
Because this is not good marketing.

107
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,960
I do not want to be on fucking CNN.

108
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,060

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,240
thank you, thank you.

125
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,300
That's like my other gripe of, uh, you're not even, bro.

126
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,940
Yeah, but we allow them to be here.

127
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:03,240
Like, um, we are a bilingual country where we speak French and English.

128
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,320
So, like, we're doing so much for them.

129
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,600
So I feel like they should cater to us.

130
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:36,720
We could have been, we could have just spoken one official language, but we decided to do too because we're because kanda is like the it's part it's like um the child from a divorced family and we have to like go from like both parents have custody does share custody of us uh kong good thank you for the super chat thank you thank you uh

131
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:49,500
all right anyway but yeah i'm super excited i've been looking forward to i actually freaked out so happy to find out, like, to see the skins.

132
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,720
Like, oh my God, the skins look so good.

133
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:08,760
I think the only thing I'm sad about is that they didn't do their classic era, the one with the, okay, I know it looks like, like, their, the outfit looks like, looks incredibly dumb, but, like, the helmets were so good.

134
00:22:09,020 --> 00:23:16,580
The classic era with the LEDs and the rainbow stuff on the helmets, I was so sad that they didn't um include that in the costume pack i think they only did like um or even i wish they included the tron outfit too the tron outfits are really good yeah uh i'm really sad they didn't do the outfit where the helmets are like leds and rainbows and stuff i wish they included that um but they did include the grammy's outfit and the one with the leather jackets and i think i don't remember which ones else they did but i was so happy about that anyway by the way if you are gonna or like elf or any cosmetics on fortnite i do have a uh do you have a creator code it is jokey bird um it does help out a lot because instead of the money going towards fortnite some of it goes to me um and fortnite or fortnite already has enough you know fortnite already has enough so it supports me as well um but yeah i'm super excited uh for the event i honestly don't know They said it's not gonna be a concert.

135
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,400
It's not gonna be a regular concert.

136
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:34,020
So it's gonna be like Very interesting to like Um To I don't know I feel like it's gonna be very interesting because if they try to clarify like Oh, it's not a regular concert That means it's a its own very unique it's a unique experience.

137
00:23:34,240 --> 00:24:45,880
So I don't know what to expect I really don't know what to expect for it, but I'm just happy that we get something, you know Like, like, you know, okay too young to uh to go to the alive 2000 i actually had to look it up i was like when was the last time they've ever done a tour and then i looked at it was like 2007 and then i remember waiting because i was like well i was too young i was like way too young to go but i still i at that time i i actually really like that fun music too um and you know years pass and like next time they do ready i'll have money i'll like beg my parents to take me there i'll have the money for it uh like i don't care if it's a school day i'm gonna be there and then there were rumors that they're gonna do like a 2017 like you know 10 year anniversary um of their uh last tour everyone was like oh it's gonna happen alive 2017 that's when they are gonna do it and then 2017 passed and then In 2001,

138
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,900
they fucking exploded and died.

139
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,620
A video showed up on the Daft Punk channel.

140
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,480
It was a premiere.

141
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,480
Everyone was so excited.

142
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,320
This is it.

143
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,280
This is when they're going to announce the tour.

144
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,680
This is it.

145
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:12,460
And then they did a countdown on a premiere video thinking it was, everyone thinking it was an announcement to their next tour.

146
00:25:14,460 --> 00:26:10,460

148
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,130
as a serious actor anymore.

149
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:57,970
I think ever since, ever since the Joker, like when he was the Joker, and in all the crazy shit he does during the filming of that Joker, the Batman movie.

150
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,410
Oh, no, it was Suicide Squad.

151
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,710
Ever since he was the Joker and the suicide squad and the shit he did, I can't see him the same.

152
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,090
He's just such a fucking weirdo.

153
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,910
Like, such a weirdo.

154
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,250
He like, okay, for those who don't know, I've talked about it before.

155
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,350
Yes, Jared Leto is the, I guess, I'll say his main actor.

156
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,170
Yeah, he started a Jesus cult, too, by the way.

157
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,450
It's also that I forgot about that.

158
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,570
He started a fucking cult, too.

159
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:35,470
But for those who don't know what he did during the filming of Suicide, that Suicide Squad, he did a lot of filming for it.

160
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,130
And then they cut, apparently they cut 80% of all the stuff he filmed for.

161
00:28:43,190 --> 00:29:22,450
and then like during during the filming he got like super into the character he was like method acting and stuff so he sent like sex toys to his co-stars as a joke and and what was it used condoms i don't remember that i don't remember about the condoms part but i knew i remember the the sex toys yeah like the co-stars were like yeah um It was so fucking weird because like Jared would just I would just receive packages from Jared And it would just be like A dildo I was just like what?

162
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:48,830
It's like yeah apparently it was like Method acting and stuff I'm like that's not method acting That's just like That's just being a freak I don't think I don't think I don't think the real Joker would send sex toys I don't I'm like I know I read a lot of joker media and i don't i don't think he ever said sex toys to like batman i don't

163
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:48,450
i don't think he'd do that to batman i think he'd send like maybe like a jack in the box and be like ha ha but i don't think he went too far as to send a fucking dildo yeah that's not that's not joking he's just yeah i don't think joker is that much of a degenerate he's a murderer yes but i don't think he was a pervert I don't know there's no rules Batman I don't know I don't know guys maybe I was wrong about maybe I didn't know Batman that well I thought he had more I I don't know I thought he had more standards than that guys I didn't realize he was that you know what I when you said he's like you know a criminal you know I thought it was like the murdering kind of as a criminal not like the of a creep of a criminal.

164
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,050
There's no laws against Pokemon, Batman.

165
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,630

181
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,310
Yeah, so I forgot he was in Morbius as well.

182
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,010
Oh, no.

183
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:38,070
I know he was like, I know Joker was like, you know, like act like abusive and stuff like that.

184
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,810
But I'd never realize he was like, I don't know.

185
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,750
I think I don't know.

186
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,430
Jared had his own headcanon about Joker.

187
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,830
Because I know, you know, like the whole Harley Quinn with Joker.

188
00:31:46,930 --> 00:32:15,830
thing but he was more so like manipulative like physical abuser like you know that's why harley quinn like left joker for poison ivy um yay quality but um um yeah yeah but i didn't realize like the joker was also like i don't know i think in jared he just was like uh he just went like Full on,

189
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,590
just a creepy degenerate.

190
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,650
Anyway.

191
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,770
Today's we are going to be playing Mega Bonk.

192
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:37,870
For those who don't know what Mega Bonk is, it is a basically it's like 3D vampire survivors.

193
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,590
So if you like vampire survivors, you'll like Mega Bonk.

194
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,810
I saw a lot of people playing Mega Bonk the last.

195
00:32:45,310 --> 00:33:40,750
two to three days and people were getting like super addicted to it and playing like like basically how dicting vampire survivors are is people are getting super addicted to this game and a lot i was also watching like you know fps streams you know like uh rivals and i saw or not i'm sorry that's not fps but you know what i mean shooter streams and then like i was watching people play rivals and people were playing mega bonk in between cues too so i was like oh wait that what is this game like usually when people play something in between cues it might be very interesting and i saw like but i also saw a lot of like other streamers playing this individually and stuff and i realized oh this is basically vampire survivors um and it has it got released like i think like last week i think it released around last week and it already has like you know 3k reviews so i was like okay this seems really promising let me try it out and i did like vampire survivors so i was like oh let's try i mean

196
00:33:40,750 --> 00:34:15,030
it's literally just vampire survivors but 3d um so i figured why not um it is roguelike as well and you can be a monkey yeah you can be a fucking monkey so why not any excuse to be a monkey or i guess or fox quick on the feet and unnaturally lucky shoots fireballs that explode on impact gain one percent luck per level sir oofy be slow but his armor's making pretty chunky all right let's i guess we're gonna be be a furry,

197
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,470

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:27,650
Alright.

208
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,050
Well, I guess we'll be a Fox.

209
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,810
A Green Place.

210
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,790
Alright, tier one.

211
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,210
Oh, I guess these are like different difficulties and stuff.

212
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,450
Bum bum bum bum.

213
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,490

214
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,590
Hello, sir.

215
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,430
I'm heading to a furry convention.

216
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,710
Do you know where to go?

217
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,010
Wait, do I have to click on it?

218
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:50,750
No, okay.

219
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,370
What does the Hawks say?

220
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,230
Alright, sound guy.

221
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,030
Let me know, like, if everything's good.

222
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,090
Alright, here you go.

223
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,050
Golden Tome.

224
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,210
Gold.

225
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,610
I feel like I should focus on gold, right?

226
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,130
Like, all these types of games.

227
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,690
It's my

228
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:43,510
I feel like I should focus on gold since like I need to buy equipment and stuff anyway right yeah it's like the first time but what if you could move faster like it's my first my first match so usually you want to buy upgrades and stuff like this is not the not run so yeah all right let me blow my nose real quick

229
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,110
Yeah, but it's the first game.

230
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,970
So I feel like gold is most important.

231
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,330
Alright.

232
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:54,890
Wee.

233
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,190
I mean, I'm not too worried.

234
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,050
It's tier one.

235
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,890
I can literally- Oh my god, I cannot stand here.

236
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,370
I- Oh, there's fall!

237
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,010
Oh, fucking course!

238
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,470
There's fall damage!

239
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,670
Oh, mock!

240
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,990
Oh, that's some music.

241
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,210
Oh, fucking course!

242
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,130
I am a fool.

243
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,890
I am only you at speed.

244
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,550
Well, I wouldn't.

245
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,950
I don't know.

246
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,370
I thought I have really...

247
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,890
I thought Fox's kid have really strong legs.

248
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,870
Alright, let's be fast.

249
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,570
I don't know what is ideal.

250
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,290
Alright.

251
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,070
I just want to be a little faster.

252
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,570
Okay, I'm fucking course.

253
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:41,950
How do I...

254
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,050
Oh, do I just stand there?

255
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,070
What does this do?

256
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,290
Okay.

257
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,590
Oh, offers you a reward.

258
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,210

00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,330
Oh, this is rare.

262
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,710

Risk The one thing I don't like about Risk of Rain Because I played Race to Rain before, like, Race to Rain, too.

272
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,770
Is that you don't see, like, so many stuff happens on my screen.

273
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,410
And also, it doesn't tell you what the items are.

274
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,350
Until you take it.

275
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,250
I hate that.

276
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,330
I hate that I don't know what it does until I take it.

277
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,370
All right.

278
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,330

I have life still.

326
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,890
I got an item that gave me extra HP, and now I have an item that takes it away.

327
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,490
Wait, what do we want?

328
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,350

332
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:12,530

Just a little bit.

00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,830
Alright, I have money, though.

We're committed to chunkers.

383
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,050

384
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,210

388
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:26,310

We have here.

391
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,390
We're slowly regaining.

392
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,010
It might be a bit, but we're slowly regaining.

393
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,050
We always bet on rock.

394
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,930
Oh my god, there's HP.

395
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,510
There's HP.

00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:44,410
We need it.

400
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,590
We haven't went to a shrine yet to cleanse our luck.

401
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,510
To cleanse our soul.

402
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:49,850
Alright.

403
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:50,390
Yay.

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:51,270
More gold.

405
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,270
It won't hurt.

406
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:54,390
Alright.

407
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,990
We're almost getting back everything.

408
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:57,110
And we have HP.

409
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,990
I don't even know where we are anymore.

410
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:02,910
Oh, there's a shrine.

411
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,050
Okay, we got the pot.

412
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,150
For the gold.

413
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,150
Oh my god, he's still there.

414
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,330
It's okay.

415
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,930
That's not fall damage.

416
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,630
Oh my god, I see so many people in front of me.

417
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,910

We actually need that.

420
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,990
We have ice damage now.

421
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:22,330
Oh, my God.

422
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:23,410
There's so many chests.

423
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,910
We're rolling in chests.

424
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:28,310
Croc.

425
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,730

Rock or speed?

436
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,290
One or two.

So off the drop.

00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,380
Let's see.

446
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,860
I guess like you can only unlock when you do achievements.

447
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah.

448
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,540
So you don't actually like, all right.

449
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,240
I'll try Sir Oofy.

450
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,520
I'm curious.

451
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,360
Alright, let's try Sir Oofy.

452
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,880
This is fun, though.

453
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,840
I'm already having a...

454
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,640
I think...

455
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,560
Now I know why people think this is fun.

456
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,500
This is like...

457
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:36,820
Not fun.

458
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,640
This is addicting.

459
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,340
Yeah.

460
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,340
I think I definitely should have got double jump.

461
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,480
This is a little frustrating.

462
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,320

00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,180

467
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:24,800

00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,100
All right.

472
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,060
Or damage to the elites.

473
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,200
Bigger slash attack.

474
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,040
Okay, if it's a...

475
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,220
Okay.

476
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,160
It better be a fucking bigger slash attack, guys.

477
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,180
Okay, nice.

478
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,660
Throw bones.

479
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,940
All right, let's...

480
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,420
Should we try bone or damage?

481
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,760
Oh, damage to them.

482
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,240
One, two, and three.

483
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,380
We're not going rock again.

484
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,360
We're doing something new.

485
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,220
We're doing something new.

487
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,420
Oh, and I got to see the Undertale stream that Toby did.

488
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,140
Apparently, he has, like, the only copy of that particular game, too.

489
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,560
That's so fucked up.

490
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,800
He's like, look at all these new things you can do in Undertale.

491
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,920
Anyway, the only person that could play is me.

492
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,400
It was like that Carmen episode where he opens his own amusement park.

493
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,720
He's like, look at all this cool stuff.

494
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,880
Anyway, only I get to experience it.

495
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,140
I own the only copy.

496
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,780
Charge 4% faster and get away nice.

497
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,300
That's the shrine shit.

498
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,060
Oh.

499
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,680
Okay.

500
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,040
Plus one projectile count.

501
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,380
Alright.

502
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,500
We do have bones.

503
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,000
Or, I mean, damage is good.

504
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,180
I feel like the damage was really good, though.

505
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,500
Yeah, he was rage baiting so hard.

506
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:12,780
Three?

507
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,520
Backpack?

508
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,640
Alright, backpack.

509
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:15,900
Okay.

510
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,280
Oh my god, I have so many bones.

511
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,660
There's Bone Town.

512
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,440
Projectile speed.

513
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,000
Tome, knockback tone.

514
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,060
One, two, or three.

515
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,200
I mean, I do have the bones.

516
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,240
I feel like bones would be good for one or two.

517
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,400
Welcome to the bone zone.

518
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,500
All right, we'll do two.

519
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,420
All right.

520
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,240
Oh, we gotta explore.

521
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,340
I forgot about the exploring part.

522
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,660
Oh, I get two slashes as well.

523
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:49,580
Wait, that's so OP.

524
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,380
Let's grab all the upgrades.

525
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,920

More sword, regen, or size?

529

I'm so many chests, but so little.

530
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,340
Wait, why did he go?

531
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,260
Why are you running?

532
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,000
Hey, get back.

533
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,300
Oh, because you're rich.

534
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,440
That's right, you can't hide your money from me.

535
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,200
That's fucking right.

536
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,500
Wait, what's this?

537
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,200
I remember there was...

538
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,660
We never opened this box yet.

539
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,740
Is he a good box or a bad box?

540
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,360
Okay, it's a nothing box.

541
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,420
We cannot do anything to this.

542
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,760
I guess we're not.

543
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,420
Okay, I need a jump, though.

544
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,600
We're more damage.

545
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,940
Wait, I should have enough money now.

546
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,260
Okay, let's go this way.

547
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,960
Slash, slash, slash, slash.

548
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:45,860
Slash, slash, slash.

549
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,640
Wait!

550
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,380
Banana!

551
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,020
Oh my god, is this the Fable Monkey?

552
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,320
The Monkey Mode?

553
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,040
Oh my god, I found a hidden banana!

554
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,320
Oh my god!

555
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,580
It's monkey time!

556
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,300
I think I can...

557
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,040
Oh, I can play the monkey now, I'm pretty sure.

558
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,480
Okay, so one of the secret characters is you can be a fucking gorilla.

559
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,760
Got my potassium.

560
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,380
40% chance of poison enemies on hit.

561
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,000
Moody cheese, my beloved.

562
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,700
It's monkey time.

563
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,580
We're all...

564
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,780
Wait, what the fuck is that?

565
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,880
What are you?

566
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,120
Hello, sir.

567
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:21,920
What are you?

568
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,520
Shake that bush.

569
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,060
Oh!

570
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,800

Why does the push have a gun?

573
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:12,080
It was standing there.

574
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,320
I thought he was French.

575
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,660
I swear.

576
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,260
I thought he looked like a friend.

577
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,800
I thought he wanted to help me.

578
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,480
Oh no!

579
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,420
He said, save you beat the bush.

580
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,400
I just wanted to beat friends.

581
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Oh my shit!

582
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,440

585
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,940
Why can't I have nice things?

00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,260

He does so much!

589
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,100
He does so much!

590
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,880
Oh my god, don't challenge!

591
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,220

00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,260
We need as much HP as we can get.

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,180
Oh my shit, please tell me that's healed.

596

Oh, this is so bad.

He's gonna shoot me, isn't he?

599
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,640

Why?

603
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,000
If you know he's bad, why do you keep trying to click on it?

604
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,580
I didn't know he's a bad person.

605
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,980
He was just standing there.

606

01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:53,990

01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:23,890

01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:30,010
I thought that was like, what the fuck is the dice guy?

775
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:30,530
The meta?

776
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,630
All leaderboards.

777
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:32,250
Where am I?

01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:12,470

We'll get the ghost next time.

794
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,630
Alright, Sir Oofy has not betrayed me.

795
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:27,590
He's actually pretty good.

796
01:09:30,170 --> 01:10:03,070

I don't want it to be harder.

798
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,840
Oh, I have to find... Oh, I didn't find the boss.

799
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,940
I was just traveling around.

800
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:16,360
Oh, my God.

801
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,380
I could have...

802
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,120
I'm so stupid.

803
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,840
I didn't realize I was not... Guys, we all know.

804
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:22,640
I just don't read.

805
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:23,900
I didn't read.

806
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:27,000
I didn't realize there was a find the boss objective.

807
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,920
Why would I make it harder?

808
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,600
Only game... I'm not.

809
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,580
Okay, this is good, actually.

810
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,500
Um, sword.

811
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:41,480
What do you say?

812
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,440
Oh my, I can't believe it.

813
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,100
I had, like, an OP build, and I just...

814
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,920
I didn't read.

815
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:48,740
I...

816
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:50,880
I didn't find the bots.

817
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,460
I had actual OP build, too.

818
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:55,880
I'm so sad.

819
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,640
Oh, it's rare.

820
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:01,780
I'll only always pick a rare one.

821
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,720
A rare one will never disappoint me.

822
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:06,340
Okay.

823
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:08,520
Alright.

824
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:11,280
1, 2, or 3, guys.

825
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:12,240
HP.

826
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,600
Max HP.

827
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,660
Firestaff or projectile speed?

828
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,240
What does it like with?

829
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:18,980
I have no idea.

830
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,140
Firestaff.

831
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:23,900
More projectile.

832
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,180
Okay.

833
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,160
I want to be able to afford.

834
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,440
I should be able to afford this now.

835
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:28,180
Alright.

836
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,000
Open Sesame.

837
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,620
Alright.

838
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:30,980
Nice.

839
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:31,720
We have regen.

840
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:32,300
Alright.

841
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,140
How much is it?

842
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,040
The microwave.

843
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:37,740
Okay, 29.

844
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,780
I can almost afford it.

845
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:39,580
I'll farm it here.

846
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,140
Wait, magnet.

847
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,060
Okay, we gotta keep that.

848
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,180
We gotta remember that for later.

849
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,240
Evasion.

850
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,060
We'll do more fire staff for now.

851
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,380
And, okay, I can afford it.

852
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:53,900
What does it do?

853
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,260
Wait, what?

854
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,740
I need more common items.

855
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,700
Is it like...

856
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,120
Oh, is it a replicator?

857
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,360
Hmm.

858
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,320
Is that what it is?

859
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,040
Alright.

860
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,060
Nice.

861
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,180
Oh, we gotta keep that area.

862
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,480
Alright, we gotta find the boss.

863
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,620
But also hope that boss doesn't fucking kill us.

864
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,880
We gotta...

865
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,500
We gotta live.

866
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,700
Wait, do I have regen?

867
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,580
I do, thank God.

868
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:22,920
Okay.

869
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,560
I got scared that I didn't.

870
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,040
Difficulty increases.

871
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,200
enemy numbers?

872
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:31,940
No, that's fine.

873
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:32,580
I don't need to.

874
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:32,860
Alright.

875
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,320
Damage tome.

876
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,400
Should I do more damage?

877
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,120
Two?

878
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,120
It eats a random item to dupe.

879
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:41,800
Like, oh!

880
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,920
Okay, so we don't need the microwave yet.

881
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,200
One or two?

882
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:45,800
Two?

883
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,060
Alright.

884
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,400
Ooh, there's a shrine here.

885
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:51,820
I can... I can live.

886
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,480
Just stand here.

887
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,980
Slash, slash, slash, slash.

888
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,360

Cool down?

892
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:36,170
Alright.

893
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,910
I assume one would be the best.

894
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:40,290
Okay, we have to explore there.

895
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,670
Look, guys, I'm finally exploring.

896
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:47,210
I say as I came back, I walked back to where I was.

897
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,970
Get extra gold when taking damage.

898
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:50,410
What the fuck?

899
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:51,330
Why would I need that?

900
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,230
I don't think I can die from this.

901
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,070
Yes.

902
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,690
That's right.

903
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:57,090
Landed.

904
01:13:57,870 --> 01:13:59,290
I will have to figure out where the boss is.

905
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,090
Yeah, I do want to get These guys out of the way.

906
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,690
one, two, or three.

907
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:09,710
Hmm.

908
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,270
Damage, sword, or cooldown?

909
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:17,750
Three?

910
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,150
Two or three?

911
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:20,630

I need to find a boss.

01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,960
Where the fuck would he be?

942
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,880
If I was a boss right now, where would I be?

943
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,320
Where would I hide, like, the coward I am?

944
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,180
Oh, not the swarm.

945
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,260

Oh, oh, get out of here.

01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,880
Okay, I didn't go right yet, so I'm gonna go right.

01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,260

01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,540
That's right.

957
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,000
Okay, 206.

958
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,580
Okay, that'll be a while.

959
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,920
Isn't it one with a key?

960
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,120
Like, how do I open that?

961
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,300
I don't fucking know.

962
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,240

Oh my god, where could that boss be?

982
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:37,260
I swear, I feel like I explored it all.

983
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:44,240
Saw word, I feel like I explored it all.

984
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,320
Where could this goddamn boss be?

985
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:51,640
Okay.

986
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,400
Wait, I have just enough.

01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,040
Legendary?

988
01:19:58,820 --> 01:19:59,960
God damn it.

989
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,740
It's all just...

990
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,760
It's all just fucking...

991
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:06,700
Uncommon.

992
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,620
Okay, there's the monkey again.

993
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,280
Okay, now I'm lost.

994
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,740
Now all this is...

995
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,140
It's not good.

996
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,060
I only have three minutes left.

997
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,300
It's not good.

998
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,840
I see the monkey again.

999
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,620
There he is again.

1000
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,160
But like, where do I go?

1001
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:26,760
Oh.

1002
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:28,820
Go this way.

1003
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,640
Where have I not gone yet?

1004
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,100
I feel like I explored it all.

1005
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,560
Everything, oh.

1006
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:35,880

There.

1009
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:36,720
There.

1010
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:36,880
There.

1011
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,060
There.

1012
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,460
Oh, shit.

1013
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:39,940

01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:18,580
Coward's Clug?

1017
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:20,320
Maybe when I get hit?

1018
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:25,920
One, yeah?

1019
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:26,980
Alright.

1020
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:28,280
Let's do it.

1021
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:29,720
Maybe the boss is over here.

1022
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,640
Cool it out.

1023
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,580
So I keep swinging.

1024
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:37,760
Just keep swinging.

1025
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,140
Just keep swinging.

1026
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,560
Just keep swinging.

1027
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:41,940
Alright, what do I get?

1028
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,340
Pick up range.

1029
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,000
Oh, crit!

1030
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:44,580
Crit chance!

1031
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,820
I'm going to crit build.

1032
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:47,160
Oh, I'm so fast.

1033
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,200
Oh, I'm so fast.

1034
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:48,800
Oh, please.

1035
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:49,420
Let me through.

1036
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,280
Let me through.

1037
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:50,740
Wait.

1038
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:51,740
That has to be him.

1039
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,060
That has to be the boss.

1040
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,120
He's wearing a suit.

1041
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:01,160
What the fuck is?

1042
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:01,660
I don't know.

1043
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,820
It's blue.

1044
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:03,660
It's uncommon.

1045
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:07,440
Elite Spoken.

1046
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,080
We're not.

1047
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:08,860
Oh, wait.

1048
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,680
Guys, I'm sorry.

1049
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,800
I'm not doing Elite Spoken.

1050
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,740
Talk to Shady Mane.

1051
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,800
Okay.

1052
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:17,320
You got money.

1053
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:17,880
I've got.

1054
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:18,700
Alright.

1055
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,160
Increase damage by 20%.

1056
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:22,540
Oh.

1057
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,360
Wait.

1058
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,800
I write a beefy ring.

1059
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,520
Yeah, I'm buying that.

1060
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:29,960
Alright, guys.

1061
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,180
Damage tome.

1062
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:31,980
Sword.

1063
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,100
Or 1, 2, or 3.

1064
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:37,480
I feel like we have enough cooldown, right?

1065
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,020
Should we do sword or damage?

1066
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,060
1?

1067
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:47,520
Alright.

1068
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,960
Ooh, fire stuff.

1069
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,060
Where the fuck is the boss?

1070
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,260
Damage.

1071
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:58,740
Summon the challenge.

1072
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,160
I'm trying to find a goddamn boss.

1073
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,880
Wait, there's money over there.

1074
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:04,360
Wait, what's that?

1075
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,780
Oh, no, I have two minutes.

1076
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:07,780
Oh, my God, I got distracted.

1077
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,500
I have two minutes.

1078
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:09,820
I got...

1079
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,780
But Stonks!

1080
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:11,780
Oh, my God.

1081
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,680
I'm so rich now.

1082
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,080
Damage.

1083
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:14,500
Oh, my God.

1084
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,120
I'm so rich.

1085
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,860
It's Stonks time.

1086
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Got more I kill.

1087
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,020
Oh my god, but I have one, two minutes.

1088
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:23,820
I can't help it.

1089
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,340
I have two minutes, though.

1090
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:32,500
But, uh, sorry.

1091
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,600
We need to find the boss.

1092
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,740
No, I don't think challenge is the boss.

1093
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,400
There's no way.

1094
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,620
I don't think so, right?

1095
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,080
It's not, right?

1096
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,220
Because I don't know.

1097
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,400
I don't know.

1098
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,920
This is my first time playing.

1099
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,440
My greed betrays you.

1100
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:53,600
Oh, we got another one.

1101
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:57,600
Oh, no.

1102
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,520
Where is the goddamn boss?

1103
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,480
That's not the boss.

1104
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,420
Okay, we have one minute.

1105
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:09,940
Power up multiplier.

1106
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:11,240
That should be good.

1107
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,880
Okay, we'll go this way.

1108
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,900
Maybe the boss is up here.

1109
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,100
I'm so high up.

1110
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,200
Maybe he wants high ground.

1111
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,220
You don't know that.

1112
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,400
Maybe that's where the boss...

1113
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:29,820
There's so...

1114
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:30,540
Wait, that's it!

1115
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,140
You see the...

1116
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:32,020
No, that's where I was.

1117
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:32,500
Never mind.

1118
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,700
Oh my god.

1119
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:35,780
Where is he?

1120
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,780
Where do you live?

1121
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,560
I just want to kill you.

1122
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,480
Is that too much to ask for?

1123
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,320
It doesn't matter.

1124
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,240
Oh, there is a magnet.

1125
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,040
Guys, it doesn't matter.

1126
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,000
We have one minute.

1127
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,320
We have one minute to find him.

1128
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,640
Because I don't think we're gonna find him.

1129
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,840
Because I don't think we're gonna find him.

1130
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:02,240
Okay.

1131
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,640
Because I have a feeling.

1132
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:08,440
I have a feeling I'm gonna get going by the ghost.

1133
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,420
Just a little bit.

1134
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,940
It's just a little suspicion.

1135
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,080
I...

1136
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,540
Oh my god, I got mega...

1137
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:20,060
At least we got mega chat, though.

1138
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:20,620
Let's go.

1139

01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:23,540

It's over there.

1144
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,580
I'm going to make it.

1145
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,800
I'm going to make it.

1146
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:29,500
Oh, my God.

1147
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,100
How do I get there?

1148
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,040
How do I get there?

1149
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:31,640
Oh, my God.

1150
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,820
12 seconds.

1151
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:35,460

01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,380

1157
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:43,920
Spawn.

1158
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,420
Spawn.

1159
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,200
Oh, my God.

1160
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,180
And the final swarm comes in.

1161
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,600
Ah, that sucks.

1162
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,340

1163
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,520
Okay.

1164
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:59,560
Oh, no, not the final swarm with the boss fight.

1165
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,240
Are you fucking kidding me?

1166
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,800
Okay, we gotta kill him.

1167
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:04,520

We gotta kill him.

1169
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:06,820

Do you think it's smart if I go kill the boss right now?

1243
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:15,930
What if I- Look at these moves?

1244
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:18,310
Okay, maybe it's not that smart.

1245
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,710
Okay, we know where it is now.

1246
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,190
We just gotta remember it.

1247
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:24,390
We just gotta remember to get back here.

1248
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:26,290
All right.

1249
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:31,350
One, two, three.

01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:33,810
You're too cool for this.

1251
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:34,630
game.

1252
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:41,110

1254
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:45,070
Alright.

1255
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:47,850
Sick.

1256
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:53,210
We need more upgrades, though.

1257
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:55,250
We need a lot more upgrades.

1258
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,930
Our upgrades are, like, so bad.

1259
01:32:58,910 --> 01:32:59,530
Oh my god.

1260
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,550
Oh my god, I'm trying to do tricks right now.

1261
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:03,590
Yeah.

1262
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:07,290
I've tried to do some sick dips.

1263
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:10,190
Okay.

1264
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,990
So hard being me.

1265
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:15,070
Tubular.

1266
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,070
Oh shit.

1267
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,870
Oh shit.

1268
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:19,030
I'm fucking up.

1269
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:23,190
Guys, it might not have been smart to increase the damage maybe.

1270
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:24,310
I think.

1271
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:29,490
Guys, I think it might have been a little stupid to increase 50% damage.

1272
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:30,370
Difficulty.

1273
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:31,450
Oh, no.

1274
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:31,790
No.

1275
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:34,550
No!

1276
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:40,430
It wasn't so rad in the end.

1277
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:41,970
Oh, quest.

1278
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:45,510
Wait, what's this?

1279
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,150
Oh, I can get more money.

1280
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:49,010
Nice.

1281
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:55,410
Okay, I might have fucked up because I increased the difficulty by 20%.

1282
01:33:55,410 --> 01:33:56,730
That was on me.

1283
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,330
That, that, no, that, that was on me, guys.

1284
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:02,150
That was a little silly of me.

1285
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:05,210
totally wasn't tubular.

1286
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:11,210
Alright, now that I know, Boney Hawk did not make it.

1287
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:17,970
My brother thought I was just too cool for school, guys.

1288
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:21,470
I was just too cool for school.

1289
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:23,650
It's crazy.

1290
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:25,690
Okay, do we do it again?

1291
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:28,670
Okay, wait, movement speed.

1292
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,390
Oh, fuck.

1293
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:30,370
Okay, guys.

1294
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:31,210
Oh, that's okay.

1295
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:33,810
I actually wanted the movement speed, even though there's...

1296
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:37,570
Oh, guys, why are we so fast?

1297
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:40,650
Guys, we can do it all over again.

1298
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:42,270
It's random.

1299
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:43,890
Guys, I can't.

1300
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:45,230
I gotta be fast.

1301
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,550
It's in my bones.

1302
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:50,150
Guys, it's in my bones.

1303
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,850
You can flip.

1304
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:54,290
You don't understand.

1305
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:55,510
Oh, my God.

1306
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:58,110
I can do bone and arrows.

1307
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:00,490
I can be a Minecraft skeleton.

1308
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:02,950
We gotta make the speed build.

1309
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:08,790
Guess if a Minecraft skeleton now, let's go!

1310
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:10,610
We're minecrafting too.

1311
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:15,150
You know a silver game?

1312
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:15,870
We need that.

1313
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,090
Oh my god, crit.

1314
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:19,930
Yeah, I'm poor.

1315
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:22,250
Skating doesn't pay.

1316
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,150
Who would have thought?

1317
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:28,010
Skating doesn't pay, guys.

1318
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:36,090
I am opening a Kickstarter, a GoFundMe so I can keep doing my Wait, one or two.

1319
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:39,910
I'm opening a GoFundMe for calcium.

1320
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:45,690
So I can continue to live my life as a radical skater.

1321
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,150
Bones are all you have.

1322
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:50,410
Okay.

1323
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:54,370
All right, let's grab this.

1324
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,770
Beer tab.

1325
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,290
Oh my god, I gotta stop.

1326
01:35:57,870 --> 01:36:00,330
I gotta actually let...

1327
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:01,450
Oh, nice.

1328
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:02,010
More bone.

1329
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,270
Oh, movement speed.

1330
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:03,710
Fuck!

1331
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:04,910
No, we have to.

1332
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:06,430
We have to be fast.

1333
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:09,010
We gotta be fast.

1334
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:13,050
As much as I love purple, we have to be fast.

1335
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:14,590
Oh, wait.

1336
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:15,150
Key!

1337
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:15,730
Wait.

1338
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:17,110
We got fun monkey.

1339
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:19,490
Wait, we have the key.

1340
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:20,590
We can free him.

1341
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:22,910
Gotta go fast.

1342
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:24,510
Guys, we gotta find him.

1343
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:25,830
Where is he?

1344
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,230
Oh, this is the greed strat.

1345
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,790
I'm greedy.

1346
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:33,810
What made you choose?

1347
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,950
Can we skate or tie?

1348
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,530
It seems a skater skill.

1349
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:37,850
We chose them both.

1350
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:39,930
It's skate and die.

1351
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:42,130
Oh my god, we gotta find the monkey.

1352
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:43,510
Don't worry.

1353
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:45,210
I'll save you.

1354
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:47,670
Don't worry, monkey.

1355
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,030
I'm skating.

1356
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:52,590
I'll be a hero.

1357
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:54,370
Oh wait, shit.

1358
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:54,890
There's a try.

1359
01:36:55,170 --> 01:36:56,750
I'll be a hero after this try.

1360
01:36:58,690 --> 01:36:59,690
I know.

1361
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,950
This is a little bit more important.

1362
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:03,810
Uh, we'll get shot.

1363
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:04,190
shield.

1364
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,710
Wait, what's this?

1365
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:07,490
Why is it red?

1366
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:09,490
Boss curse.

1367
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,830
Okay, let's not grab that.

1368
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:13,950
That doesn't seem like fun.

1369
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:17,010
Okay, he has XP.

1370
01:37:19,110 --> 01:37:19,770
How do you bone?

1371
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:22,490

1372
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:24,330
Bone.

01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:28,810

1374
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:29,670
Where is he?

1375
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,810
I'm skating, but I can't see in the five.

01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,270
I had to spend it.

1380
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:16,010
Oh my god, where the fuck is that monkey?

1381

Oh my god.

1384
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,720
Nothing can stop me now.

1386
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:31,280
Oh my god, nothing can actually stop me.

1387
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:32,820
Alright.

1388

01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,420
The one time I can't find the monkey is actually crazy.

1393
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,700
But I think...

1394
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,240
The monkey is so rare.

1395
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:18,920
Wait, movement speed.

01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:19,720

Okay, we'll get the Bo.

1399
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,880
We have to keep going fast.

1400
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,450
I'm grabbing it.

1401
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:37,950

Where the fuck is the bucket?

1409
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:52,390
Where is it?

1410
01:40:54,690 --> 01:40:55,670
Oh no!

1411
01:40:57,610 --> 01:41:00,490
I'm still trying to find the bucket!

1412
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:03,950
Oh my god.

1413
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,380

1414
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:10,080
I swear.

1415
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,100
What is this?

1416
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:14,660
Oh, attack speed and damage.

1417
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,920
Oh my god, where is he?

1418
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,740
I'll get the bow.

1419
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,580
Oh my god, I'm still trying to find him.

1420
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,260
It's been five minutes.

1421
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:31,080
Fuck yeah, I'll challenge.

1422
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,460
Surely nothing bad will happen.

1423
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,420
I can't believe it.

1424
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,100
I have found zero monkeys.

1425
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:43,260
I have found zero monkeys.

1426
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,360
I don't know where he lives.

1427
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:45,820
Oh!

1428
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,060
Where does he live?

1429
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,480
I keep looping.

1430
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,300
I can't help it.

1431
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,280
I don't know where I am anymore.

1432
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,440
Wait, wait, maybe I can.

1433
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:01,980
Maybe.

1434
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:03,900
Maybe?

1435
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:04,360
Nice.

1436
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,240
Oh my god, more.

1437
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:06,980
More.

1438
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,140
More movement!

1439
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,940
More speed, more!

1440
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,240
More!

1441
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:18,120
More speed!

1442
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:24,700
Alright, there you go!

1443
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:25,520
More!

1444
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:28,780
Oh my god, more!

1445
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:33,760
More!

1446
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:38,300
I will go fast for it.

1447
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:40,100
A level eight.

1448
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,220
Let's go.

1449
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,200
It never stops.

1450
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:57,300
Maybe I'll find the monkey now and how fast I'm going to speed.

1451
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:03,500
I feel like I'm just most likely I'll die from just accidentally hitting.

1452
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:04,860
Oh my god.

1453
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,660
Even more.

1454
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,620
Where am I?

1455
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:19,080
Guys, I think I'm going a little too, a little too fast.

1456
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:23,460
Okay, let's get the damage real quick.

1457
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:30,960
Sick airtime.

1458
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:36,600
Okay, projectile speed, let's just grab that.

1459
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,200
No such thing as too fast.

1460
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,900
Oh my god, look at this.

1461
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,400
I'm gonna start shredding.

1462
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:47,500
I'm shredding.

1463
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:53,620
I don't think the enemies can catch up to me anymore.

1464
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,400
Like, I'm actually just...

1465
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,860
I'm taking damage from, like, this guy's air attack.

1466
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:01,620
Oh shit, I spoke too soon!

1467
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,460
He landed right in front of me.

1468
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,660
Oh my god, oops.

1469
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,680
I almost died there.

1470
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,680
I actually almost...

1471
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:11,480
Oh, there's the boss.

1472
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:12,640
Nice.

1473
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:14,840
But where's the monkey?

1474
01:44:17,980 --> 01:44:20,980
I'm still trying to find the monkey.

1475
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,440
Oh, shit.

1476
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,040
Oh!

1477
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,760
I landed into the ground.

1478
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,840
I went too fast.

1479
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,980
I kept trying.

1480
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,860
I'm trying to find the monkey.

1481
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,680
I landed.

1482
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:38,500

Yes, you were.

1487
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:24,860
Alright.

1488
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,840
Oh, I'm so slow now.

1489
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:28,960
I'm not used to it.

1490
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,860
I'm not used to how slow I am.

1491
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,800
It's so wrong.

1492
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:38,280
I don't know how to...

1493
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:38,620
I don't...

1494
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,000
I don't know how to feel.

1495
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,160
Alright, increased luck, yeah.

1496
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,360
Guys.

1497
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,480
It's just so slow.

1498
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,320
It doesn't feel...

1499
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:52,080
I can't go back to living like this.

1500
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,560
Guys, ever since I started shredding.

1501
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,080
Oh, no.

1502
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,780
You can't put me back here.

1503
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:11,000
It's no longer cool.

1504
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,980
I'm addicted to speed.

1505
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:17,700
I have a problem.

1506
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,000
I have a need for speed.

1507
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:26,400
I feel like an ant now.

1508
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,980
I'm like a little...

1509
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:32,180
Oh, silver.

1510
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:35,300
I'll do fire stuff.

1511
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,360
I'll just have more project...

1512
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:38,620
Oh my god.

1513
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,860
Oh god, we can't go down from here.

1514
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,020
Let's go this way.

1515
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,580
It's just so wrong.

1516
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:45,680
I'm going through withdrawals.

1517
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:47,600
My speed draws.

1518
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:52,320
I was the king of the world.

1519
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,960
I had everything.

1520
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,420
I had so much.

1521
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,560
I was going a thousand miles per hour.

1522
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,020
We pick up range.

1523
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,400
We more convenient.

1524
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,820
Knockback, projectile.

1525
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:13,100
What do you projectile?

1526
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,180
I don't think we need knockback.

1527
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:19,540
Oh, I can...

1528
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:20,780
I almost forgot about sliding.

1529
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:23,240
Ooh.

1530
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,100
Now I'm actually straining.

1531
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,000
I'm so sad.

1532
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,480
I had the key, too.

1533
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:38,330
Oh, knockback will keep you alive when you're speed.

1534
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:39,910
Oh my god.

1535
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:40,310
Epic.

1536
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:42,670
We gotta get epic.

1537
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:44,350
I'll get more bones.

1538
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:48,310
Increase that calcium.

1539
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:51,690
Okay.

1540
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,770
Poison.

1541
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:53,890
That's good.

1542
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:58,210
All right.

1543
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:00,270
Don't take any damage for two minutes.

1544
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:01,110
Oh, that's good.

1545
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:04,010
I'm raging now.

1546
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:05,190
I'm going through a rage attack.

1547
01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:07,630
Oh, now there's the monkey.

1548
01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:08,470
Oh, wow.

1549
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:09,450
Okay, thanks.

1550
01:48:11,210 --> 01:48:13,610
Now the monkey just shows up.

1551
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,520
We get one, two, or three.

1552
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:32,920
I just went, the one time I needed it, it never showed up.

1553
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:37,240
One?

1554
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:38,880
All right, let's do greed a little bit.

1555
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,400
That's fine.

1556
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:40,540
It's just a little greed.

1557
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,860
Okay, there's the boss now.

1558
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,860
Okay, now it's a little easier to find all this.

1559
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,400
We're not going to activate the boss yet.

1560
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,900
Jump high.

1561
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:51,920
Okay, we're not...

1562
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,560
Actually, I don't know because we're shredding.

1563
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,360
I...

1564
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,980
I don't know.

1565
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,180
Shit.

1566
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,600
I don't know if like jumping would be good.

1567
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,120
But we do luck.

1568
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:03,720
You want to jump?

1569
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,620
How high can you jump?

1570
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:06,860
Woohoo!

1571
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:08,480
Ow.

1572
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,040
Whoops.

1573
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,080
Alright.

1574
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,420
Maybe a little too high.

1575
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:14,040
Oh, cooldown is good.

1576
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:16,700
Okay.

1577
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,600
Try 40% faster.

1578
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,700
God, I just need speed.

1579
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,800
I have everything but speed right now.

1580
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,080
I literally just need speed.

1581
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:30,860
More speed!

1582
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:32,400
Ow.

1583
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,140
God, where are the keys, though?

1584
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:41,800
All I need is double jump now, true.

1585
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:44,960
We are not, okay, we're not talking to without random bush, guys.

1586
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:46,780
Oh, nice, revolver.

1587
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:48,220
I get gunned now.

1588
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,040
Okay, where's...

1589
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,040
Oh, shit, chuck him.

1590
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,660
Oh my god, we were so close to unlocking this too.

1591
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,180
Come on.

1592
01:49:57,180 --> 01:49:58,060
Come on.

1593
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:58,600
Nice.

1594
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:00,620
Uh, shield.

1595
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,620
What is the power I'm up multiplied?

1596
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:05,580
Increase the power.

1597
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:06,020
Oh!

1598
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:07,920
Okay, let's do knockback.

1599
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:11,240
My Chocom's almost dead, though.

1600
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,100
We can get him.

1601
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,720
I don't want to deal with all of that bullshit.

1602
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:17,300
Alright.

1603
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,220
We got...

1604
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:19,620

1609
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:34,750
Alright.

1610
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:37,490
We got this now.

1611
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:43,490
Attack speed.

1612
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:45,710
So we can be extra fast.

1613
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:48,150
Bone town.

1614
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:50,050
Red.

1615
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,630
We like you when it's red.

1616
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:53,590
Alright.

1617
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:55,410
One, two, or three guys.

1618
01:51:59,410 --> 01:53:32,630
I can't get speed no I already fucked it up no I can't be fast no more I can't believe it I fucked up the speed field because I didn't take speed it was one it was only one instruction and I messed it up I the one instruction they gave me was to just take speed and yet somehow I forgot to take speed I can't believe it how could I mess this up okay maybe return it also spawn two extra charge stride for future wait jump high or free okay guys what if I can just okay I need oh man you're damage me me one step plan was just too complicated three you guys i don't know if i i should be guys what okay you're right you're right that's silly me i got an idiot i was like why the did you grab the jump because now because now that i can't go fast i i might as well Just jump high so I can do my sick-ass kickflip.

1619
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:39,310
At least I can do these sick-ass flips, though.

1620
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:41,290
Let's go.

1621
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:44,870
Fly away now.

1622
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:46,670
Fly away.

1623
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,350
Fly away.

1624
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:54,510
If I can't go fast, at least I can fly.

1625
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:57,750
So sick.

1626
01:53:57,930 --> 01:53:59,090
So true.

1627
01:54:00,150 --> 01:54:01,770
Where can I go?

1628
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,730
Where is just, like, climbing up here?

1629
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:06,890
That guy, what is the fuck is this?

1630
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:09,810
That's right, get nuked.

1631
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,530
Okay, I should have saved it, but whatever.

1632
01:54:12,450 --> 01:54:13,590
It is what it is.

1633
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:15,870
I could have saved that.

1634
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:18,530
Bone.

1635
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:22,470
Rare.

1636
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:23,370
What do I get?

1637
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:24,670
Back to it.

1638
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:25,230
And gain it.

1639
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:25,790
Oh, nice.

1640
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:26,530
I got reflect.

1641
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:28,990
That's cool.

1642
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:29,930
pretty sick.

1643
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:33,350
I don't have money for another shady man though.

1644
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:35,830
We need to find...

1645
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:39,390
We gotta find the key again.

1646
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:43,430
I don't know how I get to the key, but we gotta find it.

1647
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:45,130
Okay, wait.

1648
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:48,710
We can try to push, man, because I have a clock here.

1649
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:53,510
I'm not driving the difficulty.

1650
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:54,570
Oh, I have two clocks.

1651
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:55,750
All right.

1652
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:57,690
One, two, or three.

01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:02,210

01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:39,510
Yes, I know he's.

1658
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:45,310
Guys, I know he's in the bush, but guys, I'm surrounded by bushes.

1659
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,490
Which bush, though?

1660
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:50,530
Which bush could it be?

1661
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:54,590
New thorns.

1662
01:55:55,530 --> 01:55:56,590
Thorns might be nice.

1663
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:00,570
It could be anywhere.

It's always bone talent.

1667
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:12,560
Oh, wait.

1668
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:13,060

Oh, there's a shady guy.

1670
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:15,880
There's another shady guy.

1671
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,100
Okay, Ice Cube.

1672
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,260

1673
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:23,820
Okay, I just gotta save up money.

01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:26,620
Oh, my God.

1676
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:30,520
Where the fuck is he?

1677
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:34,540
Okay, we need 603.

1678
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,280
100 gold.

1679
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:37,960
Uh.

1680
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:40,720
Trying to cool down.

1681
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,860
I feel like we don't need more bone yet.

1682
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:46,720
I'm trying to find the shady.

1683
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,340
I'm trying to find a bushman.

1684
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:49,720
Wait, is that?

1685
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,040
That's green.

1686
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,420
That's green equals bone.

1687
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,400
That's green equals...

1688
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:54,680
No.

1689
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:55,500
Fuck.

1690
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:57,500
Where is he?

1691
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,120
Okay, these are all...

1692
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,040
Okay, it has to be marked with a green, right?

1693
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,600
Wait, I didn't talk to him yet.

1694
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:07,540
We're not jumping higher.

1695
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:09,240
Nice.

1696
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,920
Guys, we're not jumping higher.

1697
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,900
We jumped high enough.

1698
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,540
Guys, we don't need a jump higher.

1699
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:18,840
Nice.

1700
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:21,260
Oh, I got 700.

1701
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:21,740
Nice.

1702
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,000
Move my speed.

1703
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:23,820
Yes.

1704
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,420
Yes.

1705
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,200
Okay.

1706
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:29,980
I have ice cube now.

1707
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:32,080
Weepo.

1708
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:34,000
We could go higher, Joki.

1709
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:38,600
Guys, we don't need to go higher.

1710
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,960
I could kill him really fast.

1711
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:44,500
Okay.

1712
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:46,180
Nice.

1713
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:49,280
I guess we're not saving the monkey today.

1714
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:54,260
I guess we're not saving him today, guys.

1715
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,240
Unless I can find...

1716
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:58,260
Oh, wait, there's a nuke here.

1717
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:58,520
Okay.

1718
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,900
Wait, that's really good.

1719
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:02,100
Unless I can find him.

1720
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:04,340
I don't think we're saving him.

1721
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:36,360

Holy shit.

1723
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,420
Bone.

1724
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,760
I was not expecting that.

1725
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:46,420
I honestly, I thought I could just nuke him.

1726
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:48,180
Yes.

1727
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,160
It just felt right, but it's okay.

1728
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:51,520
I saved the clock for this.

1729
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,740
Guys, I think I'm winning.

1730
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:56,560
Oh, shit!

1731
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:58,340
It's a camp.

1732
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,480
It's a camp made it.

1733
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:01,820
Nice.

1734
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:02,980
Alright.

1735
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:07,800
I like how it gave me, like, a...

1736
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,340
A common.

1737
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:11,580
Even though I literally killed the boss.

1738
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:12,940
You know what?

1739
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,840
It's too fast, Steph, because I feel like we have...

1740
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:16,400
Oh, my God!

1741
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:17,660
Quality time!

1742
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:19,020
Alright.

1743
02:00:20,540 --> 02:00:22,060
Alright, before we do...

1744
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:23,760
I want... Oh, okay, let's take the portal.

1745
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:24,880
Goodbye, everybody.

1746
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:25,840
Goodbye.

1747
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:28,440
I'm not going through that.

1748
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,420
Where am I?

1749
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:31,480
Hello.

1750
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:34,540
The deep portal.

1751
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,120
The vibes are off.

1752
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,760
Oh, this is a new area.

1753
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,760
We can't save him.

1754
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,060
He'll be stuck caged for his crimes.

1755
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:48,680
We don't know if he's an evil monkey.

1756
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:52,340
Not everyone can be Harambe.

1757
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,240
All right, power up, drop chance.

1758
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:56,100
Two or three?

1759
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:03,030
But the monkey.

1760
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:06,090
Three, okay.

1761
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:09,210
Guys, not all gorillas are Harambe.

1762
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,670
It could be an evil gorilla.

1763
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:36,830

1764
02:01:40,750 --> 02:01:42,190
Double 30 has calcium.

1765
02:01:43,390 --> 02:01:43,790
Movement speed.

1766
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:46,910
This is the only time I can get movement speed.

1767
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,970
At least we can break.

1768
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:56,170
We gotta get this.

1769
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:59,710
I'm not increasing the difficulty.

1770
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:03,010
I think this is hard enough right now.

1771
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:05,890
Hello, brothers.

1772
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:07,190
That's right.

1773
02:02:07,650 --> 02:02:09,370
You didn't believe in me.

1774
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:11,950
must die.

1775
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:14,850
You didn't believe.

1776
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:16,230
Oh, wait.

1777
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,070
Pick up range.

1778
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:17,930
God damn it.

1779
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:19,210
Okay, we're going to do pickup.

1780
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:21,870
I know how much I would love to jump higher, guys.

1781
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:30,110
Two or one, two, or three.

1782
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:31,450
Jump!

1783
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:34,590
Damn it.

1784
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:40,410
My brothers didn't believe in my dream.

1785
02:02:43,050 --> 02:02:45,130
I had a dream, brothers.

1786
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:47,570
But you abandoned me.

1787
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:50,050
That's right.

1788
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:52,570
He was a skater boy.

1789
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:54,750
She said, see you later, boy.

1790
02:02:55,370 --> 02:02:58,790
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1791
02:02:58,790 --> 02:03:00,490
No, no, no, no, no.

1792
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:02,950
Next shit.

1793
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:03,850
Oh, movement speed.

1794
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:05,470
Oh, my God, we're doing it.

1795
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:07,990
We're bringing back the speed build.

1796
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:11,670
Oh my god.

1797
02:03:12,570 --> 02:03:14,270
It's just like old times.

1798
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:16,090
Okay, nice.

1799
02:03:16,170 --> 02:03:17,210
We found the boss here.

1800
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:20,810
Okay, now we just...

1801
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:22,790
Now we just need to find...

1802
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:25,310
We need to find Harambe.

1803
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:27,970
And it all would be good in this world.

1804
02:03:29,470 --> 02:03:30,610
It's just that easy.

1805
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:33,270
We gotta find Harambe, guys.

1806
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:34,570
Oh my god.

1807
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:35,050
It's okay.

1808
02:03:35,190 --> 02:03:35,550
It's okay.

1809
02:03:35,610 --> 02:03:36,530
We just gotta unlock this.

1810
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:39,610
One, two, or three.

1811
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:40,310
Chat build.

1812
02:03:40,410 --> 02:03:40,730
I'm so...

1813
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:41,130
fast.

1814
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:42,310
I'm speed again.

1815
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:48,100
Rambi the way.

1816
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:53,100
We gotta resurrect Rambi.

1817
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:56,520
Oh my god.

1818
02:03:57,580 --> 02:03:59,700
Oh wait, he's 53k HP?

1819
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:01,240
Oh my god.

1820
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:02,460
Okay, this is gonna take a while.

1821
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,920
I just realized he's 53k HP.

1822
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:07,940
This will take a while, guys.

1823
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:08,600
Oh my god.

1824
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:08,820
Okay.

1825
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:10,080
Alright.

1826
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,260
It's okay.

1827
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:15,900
We can jump so high until

1828
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:40,230
Attack speed I don't know what the boss curse does And I'm too scared to find out I'm way too scared to find out what he does We did all of that already Music time

1829
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:48,600
Okay Oh Oh Oh, Magnet.

1830
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:51,300
I did my kick jump.

1831
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,060
My kick flip.

1832
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:54,640
All right, the swarm is incoming, but it's okay.

1833
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,100
I can do this.

1834
02:04:56,620 --> 02:04:56,940
Whoa!

1835
02:04:57,820 --> 02:04:59,260
I can jump over.

1836
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:01,340
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1837
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:01,820
It's fine.

1838
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:03,960
I still jumped over them, technically.

1839
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:05,600
Let's go down.

1840
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:06,960
Let me feed.

1841
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:07,400
Oh!

1842
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:09,100
Oh!

1843
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,720
Oh, this is bad.

1844
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:11,740
Oh, my God.

1845
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:12,740
This is so bad.

1846
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:16,760
Guys, what?

1847
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:17,980
I invested.

1848
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:19,160
Oh my god, there's Harambe.

1849
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:20,580
Harambe, the wait.

1850
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:22,160
I'm coming for you.

1851
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,220
I'm bringing you back.

1852
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:26,780
Let's go!

1853
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,820
Find and release him.

1854
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:29,840
Let's go!

1855
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:33,380
Oh my god, he's doing it.

1856
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:36,320
He's doing the kickflips.

1857
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:39,220
Let's go, Harambe!

1858
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:46,370
He's kicked the feet.

1859
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,570
Do it up.

1860
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,820
He's back.

1861
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:56,420
And thus, we return Harambe.

1862
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,440
Oh, my god.

1863
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,080
Oh, my god.

1864
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:03,980
We did it.

1865
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,220
I don't know how.

1866
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,380
Just bone.

1867
02:06:11,780 --> 02:06:12,420
Just bone.

1868
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,300
Oh, shit.

1869
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,800
Why do I don't need a credit card?

1870
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,200
Please, I need something else.

1871
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:23,020
Oh, my god.

1872
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:23,620
We need to nuke.

1873
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:25,400
We actually need to nuke everything.

1874
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,140
It's too much.

1875
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:28,280

02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:04,860
What is that?

1880
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:05,680
Experience?

1881
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:07,900
Did I kill him for the XP?

1882
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,400
Come on, come on.

1883
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:10,640

1884
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:12,720
Oh, quantity.

1885
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:14,040
It's legendary.

1886
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,480
Oh my god, he's still here.

1887
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:20,160
I feel like I have to kill the big boss before I do anything.

1888
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,620
Oh my god, please.

1889
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:24,460
Where are the other shrines?

1890
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:26,620
I'm unstoppable now.

1891
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:28,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1892
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:29,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1893
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:30,580
Nice.

1894
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,280
Okay, regen.

1895
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:34,940
Regen is always good.

1896
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,800
Oh, there's the Easter Head.

1897
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:39,660
Max HP, yes.

1898
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,100
Oh, my God.

1899
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:45,860
All right, let's do a little more damage to the 50k golem.

1900
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,720
That's just a little...

1901
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:49,040
Whoa!

1902
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,060
That's okay.

1903
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,300
We did a little bit more damage at least.

1904
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:54,980
Thank God.

1905
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:56,920

02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:57,960
Oh, I got a little shield.

1907
02:07:58,680 --> 02:07:59,440
Oh my god.

1908
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:01,080
I know there's another magnet somewhere.

1909
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:06,180
I think if I get another magnet, it would actually be so good.

1910
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:08,560
He was a skater boy.

1911
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,440
She said, see you later boy.

1912
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:14,220

That's too much.

1916
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:23,940
It was too much.

1917
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:25,940
Too much skating.

1918
02:08:27,060 --> 02:08:28,180

1930
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:47,860
He has no stallion.

1931
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:49,660
This card has a fun...

1932
02:10:49,660 --> 02:10:50,580

Okay, but when will I ever have?

1936
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:56,600
Oh!

1937
02:10:56,980 --> 02:10:57,440

Wait, I climb.

1943
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:05,400
Monkey climb.

1944
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:08,980
Uh, what do we want?

1945
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,880
What would be good with monkey build?

1946
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:14,280
The last member of the DK crew.

1947
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:18,400
That's a lot of region, yeah.

1948
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:20,280
Banana?

1949
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:21,860
Or speed?

1950
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:24,180
Speed?

1951
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:24,980

1952
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:27,180

1953
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:30,660

1954
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:31,400
Rare!

1955
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:32,960
Increase damage.

1956
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:33,320
Okay.

1957
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:36,960
So I have one damage increase.

1958
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:38,780
That's enough.

1959
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:42,480
Monkey C, Monkey Dune.

1960
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:43,740
Monkey open chest.

1961
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:44,600
Monkey broke.

1962
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:45,780
Monkey poor.

1963
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:46,720
Monkey sad.

1964
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:51,960
Oh yeah, I can.

1965
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,900
Just enjoying the little campfire.

1966
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:02,320
White dead.

1967
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:03,760
Monkey sad.

1968
02:12:06,580 --> 02:12:07,820
Must find white.

1969
02:12:09,120 --> 02:12:10,420
Oh my god, we're so fast.

1970
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:14,140
Well, actually, speed might actually be a fucking Dutch build.

1971
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:19,700
Alright, increased damage.

1972
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:20,760
Regret.

1973
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:25,300
Alright, there is...

1974
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,160
Nice, alright.

1975
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:29,720
There's a lot of strides here, which is good.

1976
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:33,040
I don't really know exactly what build to do.

1977
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,220
Oh, projectile speed would be so good.

1978
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:37,320
No, that would be.

1979
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:39,200
We gotta grab him.

1980
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,340
We gotta kill him for XP.

1981
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:42,200
Alright.

1982
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,540
One, two, oh, lightning staff.

1983
02:12:44,820 --> 02:12:46,360
Oh my god, I got to smite people.

1984
02:12:46,540 --> 02:12:47,420
Monkey, god.

1985
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:50,820
Yo, is that a robbit?

1986
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:52,140
Love money.

1987
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:53,300
No more money.

1988
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:54,080
Regret.

1989
02:12:54,580 --> 02:12:54,900
Alright.

1990
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,660
Monkey, now god.

1991
02:12:58,300 --> 02:12:59,420
De-smite.

1992
02:13:04,360 --> 02:13:05,000
Alright.

1993
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:07,800
Projectalia.

1994
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:10,140
We can...

1995
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:10,520

More bananas.

1998
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:16,740
More bananas in my banana world.

1999
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:21,000
Do I climb this?

2000
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:21,860
Will I get...

2001
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:22,480
Ball damage?

2002
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:24,720
Oh my god, look at this.

2003
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:25,980

2004
02:13:31,490 --> 02:13:32,750

silver.

2019
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:35,670
I don't think we need silver.

2020
02:15:36,750 --> 02:15:38,130
Wait, attack speed for the banana?

2021
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:39,310
Or regen?

2022
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:40,490
Oh, that's so hard.

2023
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:40,850
Okay.

2024
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:43,890
I feel like attack speed would be so good for banana.

2025
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:47,050
Then regens are also really good, too.

2026
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:52,980
One?

2027
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:54,220
Alright.

2028
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:55,100
We'll do.

2029
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:58,520
I'm just, like, thinking.

2030
02:15:58,660 --> 02:15:59,160
Oh, man.

2031
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,400
I feel it.

2032
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:01,800
Regens also.

2033
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:02,640
Wait, I up on hit.

2034
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:03,380
Clapped her cheeks.

2035
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:03,760
Nice.

2036
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:06,580
Now we're better at clapping cheeks.

2037
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:08,080
Oh, okay.

2038
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:09,500
It's upgrade lightning.

2039
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:11,720
We don't have a lot of lightning upgrades anyway.

2040
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:16,100
Alright, I think now we can use this.

2041
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:20,000
Banana.

2042
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:21,880
Banana.

2043
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:24,040
Lightning.

2044
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:25,560
Because it's red.

2045
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:26,980
It's red good.

2046
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:29,360
Okay.

2047
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,100
Alright, now what?

2048
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:33,100
We do lightning because it's blue?

2049
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:35,920
I don't have money for the shady man.

2050
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:37,080
Okay.

2051
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:39,820
Increase the banana size!

2052
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:44,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Two

2053
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:53,540
Alright, let's see Where do we go?

2054
02:16:53,580 --> 02:17:41,880
Oh, there's something up top Monkey claw Oh, oh, oh Nice, another shady man Too bad I'm broke Swarm is coming Okay, I have my trusty banana around the cat oh fuck okay these are all really good upgrades uh one two or three they're all rare chat stop shaming bigger banana mean better more banana one one okay cool down think cool down means more banana time.

2055
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:49,560
One, two, or three.

2056
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:52,300
More attack.

2057
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:53,040
More monkey.

2058
02:17:59,580 --> 02:17:59,980
Three?

2059
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:02,200
Three.

2060
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:02,480
Okay.

2061
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:03,140
That ain't stuff.

2062
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:04,860
Oh shit.

2063
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:05,740
I don't even think I can...

2064
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:05,960
Oh!

2065
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:07,120
No way!

2066
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:07,920
Monkey climb!

2067
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:15,740
Not bad day for a monkey when monkey can climb.

2068
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:20,120
Oh, that is so strong.

2069
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:21,720
I did a great chance.

2070
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:24,460
That is so strong why I just stand there and heal.

2071
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:26,720
That's crazy.

2072
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:29,400
I just stood there.

2073
02:18:31,140 --> 02:18:32,080
Okay, I should...

2074
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:33,760
I have enough for the shady man now.

2075
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:36,220
I need to get to...

2076
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:37,800
Do this challenge too.

2077
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:42,260
Because I feel like the challenge isn't that bad.

2078
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:46,340
Okay, purple.

2079
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:50,220
Oh, that's hard.

2080
02:18:50,980 --> 02:18:52,180
Life steal is really good.

2081
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,580
He just stood there to mix more ins.

2082
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:56,320
Then I can have more projectile.

2083
02:18:56,960 --> 02:18:57,500
Life steal, right?

2084
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,840
Life steal or projectile?

2085
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:04,100
Life steal?

2086
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:06,480
Oh, wait.

2087
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:07,160
This guy's money.

2088
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:13,020
Oh, double life steal.

2089
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:16,180
Okay, we got to find the shady man now.

2090
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:18,600
Do we have enough money?

2091
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:21,700
Oh my god, that's so many I killed there.

2092
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,180
He's fine.

2093
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:25,680
Don't worry too much.

2094
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:26,980
I still...

2095
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:30,500
Only it's just I haven't found a boss yet, so I'm a little worried.

2096
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:37,000
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

2097
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:37,700
Thank you, thank you.

2098
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:41,140
He can't read, he can't spell, but you cross this con, he'll send you to hell.

2099
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:43,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2100
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:43,900
Alright.

2101
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:47,200
It's my time.

2102
02:19:49,080 --> 02:19:49,820
Oh, there you go.

2103
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:50,780
There's Shady Man.

2104
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:52,960
A little Shady Man.

2105
02:19:55,800 --> 02:19:58,720
Do I... I don't think I can... Do I open up chests for this?

2106
02:19:58,880 --> 02:19:59,640
I don't know.

2107
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:01,900
I feel like I don't, though.

2108
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:03,780
You say it's worth... I mean...

2109
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:07,680
Okay, I'll open more.

2110
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:08,860
There's a chest behind me.

2111
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:10,460
There's literally a chest behind me.

2112
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:15,040
Okay, nice.

2113
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:15,760
Clap time.

2114
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:19,420
I like how majority of my upgrades is literally...

2115
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:20,800
clapping cheeks.

2116
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:26,120
Oh my god, what is Harambe doing?

2117
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:27,160
Holy shit.

2118
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:28,640
Harambe.

2119
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:30,660
What are you doing, buddy?

2120
02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:35,920
Alright, that's a lot of money.

2121
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:37,540
That's really it.

2122
02:20:40,220 --> 02:20:42,200
Another one more movement speed.

2123
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:42,940
We like that.

2124
02:20:43,020 --> 02:20:43,880
We like that movement.

2125
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:47,340
And there's more shady guys here.

2126
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:50,280
movement speed.

2127
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:52,440
What is transfusion?

2128
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:53,520
Does anyone know?

2129
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:56,880
Is that life steal?

2130
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:01,540
It dicks up for a robbit.

2131
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:02,900
Do it, right?

2132
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:05,060
Okay.

2133
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:07,080
That sounds like life steal.

2134
02:21:08,220 --> 02:21:09,060
I'm not too sure.

2135
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:11,140
I have a lot of money now.

2136
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:13,180
Okay, nice projectile.

2137
02:21:13,420 --> 02:21:14,520
Oh, we need this actually.

2138
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:17,860
I feel like we've farmed a lot in general.

2139
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:20,140
We're having not gone.

2140
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:21,460
Maybe the right side?

2141
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:23,820
Yeah, the right side looks like I haven't walked over here yet.

2142
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:26,320
Oh yeah, I know there's a lot of stuff around here.

2143
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:28,440
Alright, beer.

2144
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:29,480
Beer-O-Cla.

2145
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:31,720
Oh my god, there's so many shrines here.

2146
02:21:31,940 --> 02:21:32,660
Alright, that's good.

2147
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:35,340
I'm staying in the middle here.

2148
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:38,800
Uh...

2149
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,200
Do we need armor?

2150
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:42,980
Armor or pickup range?

2151
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:44,240
Two or three?

2152
02:21:46,700 --> 02:21:47,320
Beer-O-Cla.

2153
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:50,000
Pick up?

2154
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:52,420
We're not doing one.

2155
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,420
I don't think that's useful.

2156
02:21:55,480 --> 02:21:56,240
Armor, okay.

2157
02:21:57,880 --> 02:21:59,040
Uh, oh, fuck.

2158
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:00,500
One or two.

2159
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:02,980
I am a, I am projectile.

2160
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,020
I have my banana rang.

2161
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:07,360
One or two.

2162
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:09,780
Crit damage or projectile.

2163
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:11,180
One, okay.

2164
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:15,260
I feel like I do have...

2165
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:17,320
This is a projectile build.

2166
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,160
Okay.

2167
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:21,140
All right, I'm standing in the middle.

2168
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:21,740
Look at that.

2169
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:23,240
I'm gaming now.

2170
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:25,120
But we still have yet to...

2171
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:26,920
The only issue is...

2172
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:32,840
The only issue right now is that we have yet to find the boss.

2173
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,740
Or more banana.

2174
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:36,740
Three?

2175
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:37,760
All right.

2176
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,240
Oh, crit damage.

2177
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:41,420
Crit damage is always good.

2178
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,560
We're doing so well, except we have yet to find the boss.

2179
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,640
Oh, I found it.

2180
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:47,120
Never mind.

2181
02:22:48,980 --> 02:23:11,420

2183
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:21,300
Okay, Harambe don't stand still.

2184
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:27,180
Harambe decided standing still might be bad at you.

2185
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:31,940
I am the one who claps.

2186
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:34,980
Holy shit.

2187
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:36,120
What the fuck?

2188
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:36,780
Airtime!

2189
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:40,300
Okay, luck.

2190
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:48,560
I might not be the skater boy anymore, but I'm still a skater boy at heart.

That's like...

2295
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:09,920
That's a little scary.

2296
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:11,640
It's magnet.

2297
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:12,520

Ghost.

2303
02:34:35,700 --> 02:34:37,720
I feel like the ghost is useless, though.

2304
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:40,260
Seems like such a useless ability.

2305
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:41,140
Wait, there's something here.

2306
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:41,800
Shady Mad.

Let's do that.

2308
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:48,960
I still don't know what that is, but let's do it.

2309
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:51,880
It seems funny.

2310
02:34:52,940 --> 02:34:53,680
His swarm incoming.

With that boss spawning, I could do this too.

2317
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:36,680
I must have killed a lot.

2318
02:35:39,540 --> 02:35:40,180

2357
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:02,750
Oh, where's that portal?

2358
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:03,510
Oh, there's no portal.

2359
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:04,350
Thank God.

2360
02:38:04,490 --> 02:38:04,970
There's no portal.

2361
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:10,650

2368
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:42,850
Jump our worries away.

2369
02:38:44,310 --> 02:38:46,410
The extra fast coaster coming.

2370
02:38:49,390 --> 02:38:50,930
Oh, I'm so scared.

2371
02:38:52,030 --> 02:38:53,410
You're so fast.

02:38:56,470 --> 02:38:57,430
I'll grab this.

2373
02:38:59,390 --> 02:38:59,650
Cool down.

2374
02:39:00,250 --> 02:39:02,330
I don't even know if I need the cool down.

I have it every time.

2377
02:39:36,630 --> 02:39:39,230
You can't catch me on the gingerbread mat.

2378
02:39:39,430 --> 02:39:41,510
Oh, they're catching me.

2379
02:39:41,550 --> 02:39:43,250
They're catching me.

2380
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:44,310
Yes!

2381
02:39:45,250 --> 02:39:46,130
Oh, I'm climbing.

2382
02:39:46,830 --> 02:39:47,610
I'm climbing.

2383
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:49,190
How is this normal?

2384
02:39:50,010 --> 02:39:51,070
Oh, my God.

2385
02:39:51,470 --> 02:39:52,170
Oh, my God.

2386
02:39:53,450 --> 02:39:53,930
No.

2387
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:59,430
Oh, oh, I'm flying.

2388
02:40:00,250 --> 02:40:01,210
I'm flying.

2389
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:03,750
It was so banana.

2390
02:40:03,790 --> 02:40:07,150
Trust in the banana, don't you?

2391
02:40:07,150 --> 02:40:08,470
I don't know!

2392
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:09,850
It is everywhere!

2393
02:40:14,730 --> 02:40:17,610
Don't stop, Charlie.

2394
02:40:18,130 --> 02:40:21,290
You touched the floor and you're dead.

2395
02:40:24,610 --> 02:40:28,270
We did two, two, almost two minutes.

2396
02:40:28,950 --> 02:40:32,210
You didn't believe in Harave enough.

2397
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:35,470
Yay, top 43.

2398
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:40,330
You know, I'm making really good progress for my first time playing.

2399
02:40:42,150 --> 02:40:45,930
Should have invested more in jump, Doki.

2400
02:40:48,370 --> 02:40:52,170
The key is to never touch the floor or you die.

2401
02:40:53,530 --> 02:40:54,450
All right, who do you want to play?

2402
02:40:55,570 --> 02:40:56,790
Do you want to try?

2403
02:40:57,390 --> 02:40:57,830
Clank?

2404
02:40:57,970 --> 02:41:02,850
Do we want to be a clanker or gender-bend Robin Hood?

2405
02:41:03,790 --> 02:41:04,930
Oh, Clank has a gun?

2406
02:41:05,170 --> 02:41:06,670
Wait, but Robin Hood has more experience.

2407
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:07,310
Okay, we'll try.

2408
02:41:09,050 --> 02:41:11,670
We'll try Clanker or Clank.

2409
02:41:15,390 --> 02:41:15,830
Orra.

2410
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:17,990
Wait, I want Orra, actually.

2411
02:41:18,490 --> 02:41:19,390
I'll grab Orra.

2412
02:41:19,730 --> 02:41:20,230
And now we're...

2413
02:41:20,230 --> 02:41:21,510
Wait, we can have more quests, though.

2414
02:41:22,830 --> 02:41:23,770
Where is it?

2415
02:41:24,190 --> 02:41:24,750
There we go.

2416
02:41:25,450 --> 02:41:25,890
Poison.

2417
02:41:26,530 --> 02:41:27,350
A couple of them.

2418
02:41:27,830 --> 02:41:28,570
I got a gun.

2419
02:41:28,690 --> 02:41:29,510
Now it's over.

2420
02:41:29,890 --> 02:41:30,550
It's over.

2421
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:33,770
This is the gun I used to kill.

2422
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:35,670
Arambe the White.

2423
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:37,990
Nice.

2424
02:41:38,910 --> 02:41:39,450
Alright.

2425
02:41:39,930 --> 02:41:40,790
Let's see.

2426
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:42,790
Oh, I got another one.

2427
02:41:43,050 --> 02:41:43,750
Mega Chad.

2428
02:41:44,090 --> 02:41:45,070
Oh, because I got aura.

2429
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:47,690
Wait, I want to unlock Mega Chad.

2430
02:41:47,810 --> 02:41:50,010
Alright, we'll do a clanker first.

2431
02:41:51,670 --> 02:41:52,210
Uh...

2432
02:41:54,110 --> 02:41:55,790
I'll create another weapon.

2433
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:57,330
Yeah, Turbo Skates.

2434
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:59,330
Ooh, that would have been good for...

2435
02:41:59,330 --> 02:42:02,650
That should have been good for calcium.

2436
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:03,210
Alright.

2437
02:42:03,790 --> 02:42:27,530

02:42:36,590 --> 02:42:38,190
Yeah, I really like the movement.

2440
02:42:39,810 --> 02:42:41,130
I didn't see it.

2441
02:42:41,330 --> 02:42:43,130
Yeah, the movement is so...

2442
02:42:43,130 --> 02:42:44,990
Alright, I'm ready for tier 3.

2443
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:50,060
Alright.

2444
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:52,840
And I haven't even locked everything in.

2445
02:42:52,960 --> 02:42:53,580
Pew, pew, pew.

2446
02:42:53,740 --> 02:42:54,440
That's right.

2447
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:56,440
I got a gun now.

2448
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:02,420
It's high news somewhere in this world.

2449
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,260
Wait, this guy's me!

2450
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:06,440

I don't even know what... And this is me not knowing any of... Okay, let's get the boss curse.

2454
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:15,340
I'm curious.

2455
02:43:15,500 --> 02:43:16,320
What does this do?

2456
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:19,780
What is he doing?

2457
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:22,000
What did it do?

2458
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:25,720
Wait, guys, what does the... I don't know what I did.

2459

02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:30,980
Wait, what did I do?

2461
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,580
Wait, why is it doomed?

2462
02:43:33,860 --> 02:43:34,260
Why...

2463
02:43:34,260 --> 02:43:35,180

One or two?

2467
02:44:15,460 --> 02:44:16,400

All right.

02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:22,840
Can I regen shield, though?

2471
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:25,420
I assume I- I hope I can.

2472
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:26,380
That would be- yeah, I can't.

2473
02:44:26,420 --> 02:44:27,020
All right, that's good.

2474
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:31,220
I just don't have a lot of HP, which is bad.

2475
02:44:34,140 --> 02:44:35,080
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

2476
02:44:35,140 --> 02:44:35,600
Oh, shit.

Alright, it's fine.

2480
02:45:14,620 --> 02:45:16,300
I just threw a little shimmy.

2481
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:18,920
Oh, life steal.

2482
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:20,240
Life steal with gun?

2483
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:21,760
That sounds strong.

2484
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:23,100
Alright.

2485
02:45:23,420 --> 02:45:23,900
Gun!

2486
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:28,100
Okay, love.

2487
02:45:29,300 --> 02:45:31,080
Okay, I don't know if I want to make this hard.

2488
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:32,320
I think I've already done enough.

2489
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:36,180
You need your last...

2490
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:39,800
That's right.

2491
02:45:40,060 --> 02:45:41,860
It's a clanker world up there.

2492
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:45,840
Alright.

2493
02:45:46,580 --> 02:45:48,280
I need to find a magnet fast.

2494
02:45:48,740 --> 02:45:49,820
I feel so slow.

2495
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,020
I was jumping everywhere.

2496
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:54,460
I feel so fucking slow.

2497
02:45:55,060 --> 02:45:55,960
Oh my god.

2498
02:45:56,380 --> 02:45:57,760
Oh my god.

2499
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:58,380
I don't...

2500
02:45:58,380 --> 02:45:59,320
Oh my god.

2501
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:00,520
Oh this is so bad.

2502
02:46:01,180 --> 02:46:02,240
Oh how bad is it?

2503
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,100
Okay it's not that bad.

2504
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:04,880
The fall damage is not that bad.

2505
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:05,600
Okay that's good.

2506
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:07,860

I still have bone.

2512
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:18,060
It's okay, it still works.

2513
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:21,360
All I have to do is just use bone.

2514
02:47:22,140 --> 02:47:23,840
Oh my god, oh my god.

2515
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:26,880
I'm trying to look behind me, but there's so many things in front of me too.

2516
02:47:29,340 --> 02:47:29,400
Okay.

2517
02:47:30,140 --> 02:47:31,900
There's a chest when I'm coming back.

2518
02:47:33,400 --> 02:47:34,740
This might be a little foolish.

2519
02:47:35,820 --> 02:47:37,080
But I gotta grab this.

2520
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:37,280
Nice.

2521
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:38,420
I got one of them.

2522
02:47:39,460 --> 02:47:39,840
Okay.

2523
02:47:40,740 --> 02:47:41,460
Oh my god, he's stuck.

2524
02:47:41,740 --> 02:47:42,940
Oh, he's not stuck anymore.

2525
02:47:43,180 --> 02:47:45,200
I spoke too soon.

2526
02:47:45,780 --> 02:47:46,740
It's not stuck.

2527
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:48,020
He's okay.

2528
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:49,280
He's a-okay, guys.

2529
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:51,760
Okay, nice.

2530
02:47:55,750 --> 02:47:56,950
I'll grab that because it's purple.

2531
02:48:00,530 --> 02:48:02,330
No, not- I won't use the magnet yet.

2532
02:48:02,390 --> 02:48:03,270
I'm gonna save it.

2533
02:48:04,590 --> 02:48:06,450
Okay, I'm a little faster, which is nice.

2534
02:48:07,570 --> 02:48:08,450
form is incoming.

2535
02:48:09,210 --> 02:48:10,090
But, like, I have gun.

2536
02:48:10,290 --> 02:48:11,870
What's the worst that could happen?

2537
02:48:12,530 --> 02:48:18,930
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Yeah, what's the worst that could happen, guys?

2538
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:20,530
I have gun.

2539
02:48:20,670 --> 02:48:20,910
Woo!

2540
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:23,190
I still have gun.

2541
02:48:25,910 --> 02:48:28,310
Oh my god, there's no, like, rare or legendaries.

2542
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:30,370
I feel like I'm not getting any.

2543
02:48:32,330 --> 02:48:33,950
Okay, there's a magnet here.

2544
02:48:34,730 --> 02:48:37,550
I'm gonna save that magnet for emergency.

2545
02:48:37,570 --> 02:48:39,890
Oh my god, this might be an emergency now.

2546
02:48:42,970 --> 02:48:45,880
Guys, I think we're at the emergency era now.

2547
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:47,650
Okay.

2548
02:48:48,650 --> 02:48:49,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2549
02:48:50,790 --> 02:48:51,230
Gun.

2550
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:55,090
Crit or a projectile count?

2551
02:48:55,810 --> 02:48:57,190
Because we are in a crit build.

2552
02:48:58,450 --> 02:49:00,070
Gun always wins.

2553
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:04,490
Two?

2554
02:49:05,210 --> 02:49:05,870
Three?

2555
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:11,660
Three.

2556
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:12,700
Okay, I see more threes.

2557
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:16,400
Okay, check it out.

2558
02:49:19,060 --> 02:49:21,380
God, I haven't found, like...

2559
02:49:21,380 --> 02:49:23,220
I haven't found the boss yet, which is bad.

2560
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:25,680
This is fine.

2561
02:49:26,480 --> 02:49:27,120
This is fine.

2562
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:28,820
This is still fine.

2563
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:33,700
Oh my god, how much stuff do I have to get?

2564
02:49:34,620 --> 02:49:36,280
Alright, we'll do the magnet now.

2565
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:39,240
Oh, bone.

2566
02:49:39,400 --> 02:49:40,900
Just because we haven't done any...

2567
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:41,740
Revolver.

2568
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:43,200
Quantity.

2569
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:44,720
Bone.

2570
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:48,480
Revolver.

2571
02:49:49,580 --> 02:49:51,460
Uh, now I don't know!

2572
02:49:51,940 --> 02:49:52,940
Now I know!

2573
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:56,860
Do we want quantity, agility, or gun?

2574
02:49:57,680 --> 02:49:58,060
One?

2575
02:50:02,190 --> 02:50:02,750
Okay.

2576
02:50:03,550 --> 02:50:04,330
Nice.

2577
02:50:07,510 --> 02:50:08,810
Alright, nice.

2578
02:50:09,170 --> 02:50:10,650
Okay, now we super fast.

2579
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:14,590
Now we can kill everything.

2580
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:15,990
Oh my god.

2581
02:50:16,090 --> 02:50:16,930
Wait, that's instant.

2582
02:50:17,290 --> 02:50:18,350
Wait, I'm so strong now.

2583
02:50:18,910 --> 02:50:21,030
I swear to God, it's all just magnets.

2584
02:50:22,090 --> 02:50:26,070
I haven't found, like, any useful equipment.

2585
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:30,630
Useful greens, except for magnets.

2586
02:50:33,690 --> 02:50:34,210
Okay, nice.

2587
02:50:34,330 --> 02:50:35,850
I gotta break more of the containers.

2588
02:50:38,570 --> 02:50:40,410
We never leave the bone zone.

2589
02:50:40,710 --> 02:50:43,250
Guys, we're here forever.

2590
02:50:43,290 --> 02:50:45,950
We're always boning in that zone.

2591
02:50:50,950 --> 02:50:53,050
You'll never leave.

2592
02:50:58,060 --> 02:50:58,880
One, two, or three?

2593
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:07,820
One?

2594
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:08,860
Two?

2595
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:10,680
One, okay.

2596
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:13,780
What is that?

2597
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:14,880
Can you see that?

2598
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:15,500
It's like...

2599
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:17,820
Oh, it's the greed thing.

2600
02:51:18,040 --> 02:51:18,820
Okay, we don't need the greed.

2601
02:51:20,580 --> 02:51:22,720
We can stay here for a little bit.

2602
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:28,740
I feel like HP regen would be good because I have so little HP.

2603
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:30,040
I'm going to do it.

2604
02:51:30,220 --> 02:51:31,520
I'm trusting my gut.

2605
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:34,040
Just because of how weak I am.

2606
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:42,640
Just because I feel like I don't have a lot of HP.

2607
02:51:42,920 --> 02:51:44,780
So the regen would, like, come in clutch.

2608
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:49,780
Okay, let's grab this chest.

2609
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:56,980
Alright, here we go.

2610
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:02,330
Andrew, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

2611
02:52:02,910 --> 02:52:04,310
Who's dingy bird?

2612
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:05,050
What?

2613
02:52:08,030 --> 02:52:09,470
Wait, who's that?

2614
02:52:10,470 --> 02:52:13,670
Andrew, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2615
02:52:14,390 --> 02:52:14,910

2616

What?

2617
02:52:18,210 --> 02:52:23,150
I don't know if you're serious or not, but thank you for the super chat.

2618
02:52:23,170 --> 02:52:24,590
Thank you, thank you.

No, my, oh, gee.

2621
02:52:34,830 --> 02:52:36,550
It is a real person?

2622
02:52:37,410 --> 02:52:38,290
Oh my god.

2623
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:43,980

We need this.

2656
02:55:18,310 --> 02:55:19,250
We need to outrun all.

2657
02:55:19,990 --> 02:55:22,010
We need to outrun this so badly.

2658
02:55:22,550 --> 02:55:23,750
Oh, I like shit.

Oh my god, there's the shady man.

2661
02:55:29,750 --> 02:55:31,150
There's the shady man.

2662
02:55:33,330 --> 02:55:33,970
Okay, revolver.

2663
02:55:37,050 --> 02:55:37,850
Maybe I can...

2664
02:55:37,850 --> 02:55:38,690
Maybe I can stand here.

2665
02:55:38,810 --> 02:55:39,350
Nope, I can't.

2666
02:55:40,290 --> 02:55:40,870
I can't.

2667
02:55:43,010 --> 02:55:43,730
It's okay.

2668
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:47,570
Uh...

2669
02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:48,930
Yo, 30...

2670
02:55:49,590 --> 02:55:50,970
Three more damage.

2671
02:55:51,410 --> 02:55:52,050
Yeah, we'll get that.

2672
02:55:52,230 --> 02:55:52,610
Fuck it.

2673
02:55:53,010 --> 02:55:53,970
We'll get that.

2674
02:55:54,170 --> 02:55:55,590
We'll get that too.

2675
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:58,350
Oh my god, jump higher.

2676
02:55:58,590 --> 02:55:59,510
That's what I needed.

2677
02:56:00,070 --> 02:56:02,410
Oh my god.

2678
02:56:03,670 --> 02:56:05,810
Oh my god, we have to kill these guys.

2679
02:56:06,450 --> 02:56:06,770
Please.

2680
02:56:08,470 --> 02:56:08,850
Please.

2681
02:56:10,690 --> 02:56:11,330
Please.

2682
02:56:13,530 --> 02:56:15,350
We have to kill them.

2683
02:56:16,110 --> 02:56:17,910
Oh my god, the ghosts are coming.

2684
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:20,530
The ghosts are coming.

2685
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:23,990
We need to kill them before it's too late.

2686
02:56:25,230 --> 02:56:26,470
Oh my god, where's the portal?

2687
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:27,470
Where's the portal?

2688
02:56:28,550 --> 02:56:30,050
We gotta go, we gotta go.

2689
02:56:30,490 --> 02:56:31,370
We gotta go.

2690
02:56:31,770 --> 02:56:32,610
We gotta go!

2691
02:56:35,610 --> 02:56:36,930
We gotta leave.

2692
02:56:39,330 --> 02:56:40,030
All right, nice.

2693
02:56:40,770 --> 02:56:41,250
Okay, I can.

2694
02:56:41,410 --> 02:56:43,170
I will do a little bit.

2695
02:56:43,850 --> 02:56:46,310
We'll farm a little bit before we go to hell.

2696
02:56:46,570 --> 02:56:48,110
Well, we'll farm just a little bit.

2697
02:56:50,190 --> 02:56:51,210
Oh my god.

2698
02:56:51,390 --> 02:56:52,250
I forgot about the boss loot.

2699
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:53,430
Oh my god.

2700
02:56:53,630 --> 02:56:53,770
Fuck.

2701
02:56:53,990 --> 02:56:54,310
Okay.

2702
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:58,470
I forgot all about the boss move.

2703
02:56:58,950 --> 02:57:00,330
I forgot all about it.

2704
02:57:01,110 --> 02:57:02,110
Can I still make it?

2705
02:57:02,570 --> 02:57:03,530
Oh my God, it's fine.

2706
02:57:03,690 --> 02:57:04,010
It's fine.

2707
02:57:04,450 --> 02:57:05,530
We can still make it.

2708
02:57:08,310 --> 02:57:09,870
Oh my God, that's so risky.

2709
02:57:11,190 --> 02:57:12,210
This was so risky.

2710
02:57:13,670 --> 02:57:15,610
Okay, okay, we go, we go, we go.

2711
02:57:15,730 --> 02:57:18,510
We run, we run, we run, we run, we run, we run.

2712
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:19,830
We run, we run, we run.

2713
02:57:20,970 --> 02:57:22,450
Oh my God, where is that point?

2714
02:57:22,570 --> 02:57:23,790
Oh my God, it's okay.

2715
02:57:23,990 --> 02:57:24,350
Run!

2716
02:57:31,770 --> 02:57:32,010
Okay.

2717
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:34,290
We made it.

2718
02:57:36,210 --> 02:57:37,010
Holy shit.

2719
02:57:40,090 --> 02:57:40,910
All right.

2720
02:57:41,330 --> 02:57:42,610
That knocked...

2721
02:57:42,610 --> 02:57:45,430
When I got the agility shit, I actually came in clutch.

2722
02:57:45,850 --> 02:57:46,970
I think I could have died.

2723
02:57:48,270 --> 02:57:49,910
Definitely almost died there.

2724
02:57:54,290 --> 02:57:56,070
I need projectile speed.

2725
02:57:56,170 --> 02:57:57,730
No, I definitely need projectile speed.

2726
02:58:00,010 --> 02:58:03,750
Uh, or I can get, or, okay, I do have two.

02:58:03,890 --> 02:58:06,730
I am, I, wait, are the bosses elites?

2728
02:58:07,550 --> 02:58:19,250
Because the thing is, I do need, I might need, I might need this because I have two bosses, or I could, guys, I could have four.

2729
02:58:23,990 --> 02:58:38,810

2732
02:58:59,690 --> 02:59:01,570
I know it would be so funny.

2733
02:59:06,730 --> 02:59:08,130
Pick up Ranger extra jumps.

2734
02:59:08,890 --> 02:59:09,530
Shit.

2735
02:59:11,750 --> 02:59:12,870

2736
02:59:15,730 --> 02:59:17,350

02:59:19,610 --> 02:59:21,410

02:59:21,990 --> 02:59:23,050
It has never failed me.

2740
02:59:23,070 --> 02:59:24,010

2745
03:00:29,490 --> 03:00:30,310
Oh, that sucks.

2746
03:00:30,470 --> 03:00:30,910
That is not good.

2747
03:00:31,110 --> 03:00:31,730
That is not good.

2748
03:00:32,110 --> 03:00:32,450
Oh, no.

2749
03:00:32,830 --> 03:00:34,530
Oh, oh, the thing resets us.

2750
03:00:34,590 --> 03:00:35,110
Oh, thank God.

2751
03:00:35,210 --> 03:00:35,650
Oh, thank God.

2752
03:00:35,810 --> 03:00:36,330
It resets us up.

2753
03:00:36,710 --> 03:00:37,410
Oh, thank God.

2754
03:00:37,550 --> 03:00:38,910
I didn't realize it resets us up.

2755
03:00:38,970 --> 03:00:39,310
Thank God.

2756
03:00:39,570 --> 03:00:40,350
Oh, I really need that.

2757
03:00:40,510 --> 03:00:41,630
I actually really need that.

2758
03:00:42,550 --> 03:00:43,970
That is actually so good for me.

2759
03:00:46,790 --> 03:00:48,010
I want to kill him.

2760
03:00:49,830 --> 03:00:52,570
God, it takes me 20 years to kill this cat.

2761
03:00:53,050 --> 03:00:54,090
It takes so long.

2762
03:00:55,730 --> 03:00:57,410
It's so laggy, so tanky.

2763
03:00:58,210 --> 03:00:59,470
I might need more damage.

2764
03:00:59,750 --> 03:01:01,070
I may or may not need more damage.

2765
03:01:02,230 --> 03:01:02,510
Maybe.

2766
03:01:04,370 --> 03:01:04,730
Alright.

2767
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:06,930
Bigger bone and bigger bullets.

2768
03:01:08,750 --> 03:01:09,210
Oh my gosh.

2769
03:01:10,170 --> 03:01:11,270
I'm so weak.

2770
03:01:11,930 --> 03:01:12,690
I'm so weak.

2771
03:01:15,870 --> 03:01:16,710
Knock back.

2772
03:01:17,970 --> 03:01:20,010
At least the knockback will give me a bit more time.

2773
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:23,510
Where is he?

2774
03:01:24,130 --> 03:01:25,490
He's like below me, isn't he?

2775
03:01:25,730 --> 03:01:26,570
Oh, there he is.

2776
03:01:27,510 --> 03:01:29,510
I think this is a good time for the magnet now.

2777
03:01:31,850 --> 03:01:32,310
Wee!

2778
03:01:36,020 --> 03:01:37,000
Alright, gun.

2779
03:01:40,590 --> 03:01:41,310
Oh my god, that's good.

2780
03:01:41,430 --> 03:01:41,610
That's good.

2781
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:42,890
I just got...

2782
03:01:42,890 --> 03:01:43,230
Gun!

2783
03:01:45,370 --> 03:01:47,070
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2784
03:01:47,230 --> 03:01:48,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2785
03:01:48,730 --> 03:01:49,510
We leave.

2786
03:01:50,290 --> 03:01:51,030
We leave.

2787
03:01:51,510 --> 03:01:51,690
We leave.

2788
03:01:52,130 --> 03:01:53,050
We leave.

2789
03:01:54,370 --> 03:01:56,150
Oh my god, we leave so fast.

2790
03:01:56,890 --> 03:01:58,130
We leave so fast.

2791
03:01:58,850 --> 03:02:01,090
Oh my god, I am so fucking vulnerable.

2792
03:02:02,210 --> 03:02:04,410
Run, don't you run?

2793
03:02:05,110 --> 03:02:06,570
I am so weak.

2794
03:02:07,970 --> 03:02:09,450
This robot is so weak.

2795
03:02:09,630 --> 03:02:12,350
He doesn't even have the DPS to fucking make up for it.

2796
03:02:12,630 --> 03:02:13,670
For this weak ass.

2797
03:02:18,330 --> 03:02:19,110
That's fine.

2798
03:02:19,330 --> 03:02:20,190
Everything is fine.

2799
03:02:23,130 --> 03:02:24,550
Fly, you fool.

2800
03:02:25,630 --> 03:02:25,830
Fly.

2801
03:02:29,090 --> 03:02:31,150
I swear to God, it does not.

2802
03:02:31,170 --> 03:02:50,850

03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:08,320
Oh, is it worth it, though?

2805
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:10,260
Is it worth it?

2806
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:14,720
It might be worth it.

2807
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:15,360
Oh, okay.

2808
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:16,140
Ray.

2809
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:18,480
Oh, my God.

2810
03:03:18,740 --> 03:03:20,020
I really want to grab that nuke.

2811
03:03:22,300 --> 03:03:24,460
Imagine all the money I could grab down here.

2812
03:03:25,640 --> 03:03:26,140
Here it is.

2813
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:26,480
There it is.

2814
03:03:26,620 --> 03:03:26,960
There it is.

2815
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:28,000
Oh, my God.

2816
03:03:28,060 --> 03:03:28,840
No, no, no, no, no.

2817
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:30,560
Oh, shit.

2818
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:32,260
No.

2819
03:03:38,460 --> 03:03:41,580
I swear to God, he's made of fucking plastic.

2820
03:03:41,960 --> 03:03:42,780
He's so...

2821
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:43,440
I don't like...

2822
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:44,260
I don't like him.

2823
03:03:45,140 --> 03:03:45,960
He's so...

2824
03:03:45,960 --> 03:03:47,380
He's so fragile.

2825
03:03:48,760 --> 03:03:51,460
He's like a glass build or some shit.

2826
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:52,380
Yeah, the greed.

2827
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:53,460
I don't like it.

2828
03:03:53,720 --> 03:03:54,160
His build...

2829
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:56,240
He's so fucking weak as hell.

2830
03:03:56,300 --> 03:03:57,080
We'll try Robin.

2831
03:03:59,020 --> 03:04:01,080
Let's grab some items.

2832
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:03,100

2835
03:05:11,420 --> 03:05:12,560
Stops damage and...

2836
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:13,060
Alright, you know what?

2837
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:13,660

03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:17,120
Let's do tier...

2841
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:18,000
We'll do tier 3.

2842
03:05:18,600 --> 03:05:19,920
Oh wait, there's a new map.

2843
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:20,700
Wait, I wanna...

2844
03:05:22,760 --> 03:05:23,560

Restart.

03:05:26,300 --> 03:05:27,240
Oh wait, not here.

2847
03:05:27,640 --> 03:05:28,680
I clicked the wrong one.

2848
03:05:28,840 --> 03:05:30,700
Okay, I just... I just want to see him.

2849
03:05:30,880 --> 03:05:32,440
Like, I just wanted to see him.

2850
03:05:33,500 --> 03:05:35,260
in because it was such a Chad mood.

2851
03:05:36,440 --> 03:05:37,660
A hot... Yeah, I want to try this.

2852
03:05:38,180 --> 03:05:38,520
Oh!

2853
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:39,240
Wait, okay.

2854
03:05:39,560 --> 03:05:41,100
Let's beat tier 3.

2855
03:05:41,200 --> 03:05:42,840
I'd rather beat tier 3 than try the new map.

2856
03:05:47,710 --> 03:05:48,150
Bump.

2857
03:05:48,390 --> 03:05:48,550
Oh.

2858
03:05:52,690 --> 03:05:53,710
Look at me.

2859
03:05:54,430 --> 03:05:55,530
Oh my god.

2860
03:05:55,630 --> 03:05:56,730
Wait, I think it's the garlic.

2861
03:05:56,870 --> 03:05:57,570
Yeah, it is.

2862
03:06:00,490 --> 03:06:01,370
That's right.

2863
03:06:03,270 --> 03:06:03,710
Bump.

2864
03:06:03,910 --> 03:06:04,070
Bump.

2865
03:06:05,450 --> 03:06:06,770
Oh my god.

2866
03:06:06,870 --> 03:06:10,170
Look at this Alright, let's...

2867
03:06:10,170 --> 03:06:11,590
What do we get?

2868
03:06:12,310 --> 03:06:13,770
I don't...

2869
03:06:14,370 --> 03:06:16,510
Do we want any of these tomes?

2870
03:06:16,650 --> 03:06:17,970
Or should we... What build do we...

2871
03:06:17,970 --> 03:06:20,210
Yeah, he's literally aura farming.

2872
03:06:22,290 --> 03:06:23,890
Is that size build?

2873
03:06:24,070 --> 03:06:25,210
Do we do a size build?

2874
03:06:26,190 --> 03:06:27,850
Aura farming is real.

2875
03:06:31,110 --> 03:06:31,730
Damn.

2876
03:06:32,270 --> 03:06:33,070
That's right.

2877
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:40,080
Gotta keep it up.

2880
03:07:12,990 --> 03:07:14,470
Let's just keep focusing on aura.

2881
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:18,470
Alright.

2882
03:07:19,750 --> 03:07:21,630
No weapons only aura.

2883
03:07:23,930 --> 03:07:25,670
The aura must grow.

2884
03:07:28,990 --> 03:07:30,270
Oh my god, size.

2885
03:07:30,670 --> 03:07:32,030
Wait, does size increase the aura?

2886
03:07:32,290 --> 03:07:32,810
I can't tell.

2887
03:07:33,210 --> 03:07:33,830
Is it increased?

2888
03:07:34,390 --> 03:07:35,870
Did it get, did my aura get bigger?

2889
03:07:38,590 --> 03:07:41,170
You think my aura grew bigger, guys?

2890
03:07:41,950 --> 03:07:43,770
That's right, they wish they were me.

2891
03:07:43,990 --> 03:07:46,510
Oh my god, I flexed!

2892
03:07:46,670 --> 03:07:48,490
I actually started...

2893
03:07:48,490 --> 03:07:49,470
I don't know if crit...

2894
03:07:49,470 --> 03:07:50,310
Does this do crit?

2895
03:07:50,490 --> 03:07:51,350
I can't tell.

2896
03:07:52,750 --> 03:07:54,510
Size matters now.

2897
03:07:56,330 --> 03:07:56,930
Do I want...

2898
03:07:56,930 --> 03:07:58,030
Wait, does it...

2899
03:07:58,030 --> 03:07:59,090
Does aura give crit?

2900
03:08:02,810 --> 03:08:03,290
Aura?

2901
03:08:03,490 --> 03:08:04,590
Okay, we just keep going.

2902
03:08:06,570 --> 03:08:07,530
Never stop.

2903
03:08:07,710 --> 03:08:08,610
Aura farming.

2904
03:08:11,410 --> 03:08:13,230
I don't even know what would go well with aura.

2905
03:08:13,610 --> 03:08:14,250
What?

2906
03:08:15,170 --> 03:08:16,330
Oh, the aura.

2907
03:08:16,990 --> 03:08:18,730
That's right, can't touch me.

2908
03:08:19,590 --> 03:08:21,610
You have to have a specific type of aura.

2909
03:08:26,130 --> 03:08:27,710
The fucking flex.

2910
03:08:31,640 --> 03:08:32,860
That's fucking right.

2911
03:08:33,860 --> 03:08:34,960
Get over here, skeleton.

2912
03:08:39,670 --> 03:08:42,410
Max 40% the faster I move.

2913
03:08:43,090 --> 03:08:43,370
Aura.

2914
03:08:44,950 --> 03:08:46,150
Oh wait, I should have got the damage.

2915
03:08:47,370 --> 03:08:48,210
Oh well, it's too late.

2916
03:08:48,430 --> 03:08:49,070
This is more important.

2917
03:08:49,150 --> 03:08:52,470
I can just stand there and you can't touch me.

2918
03:08:58,450 --> 03:09:00,230
I feel like knockback would be good, right?

2919
03:09:00,730 --> 03:09:01,070
Yeah.

2920
03:09:02,090 --> 03:09:04,130
There's no way knockback is included with this.

2921
03:09:05,130 --> 03:09:06,310
Does this give knockback?

2922
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:13,360
I don't think it does.

2923
03:09:13,540 --> 03:09:14,200
Oh, it doesn't.

2924
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:15,860
Okay, I wasted it.

2925
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:18,380
I don't know if it does.

2926
03:09:19,420 --> 03:09:19,880
Pickup range.

2927
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:22,680
I feel like pickup range so when the more aura I have.

2928
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:25,400
Uh...

2929
03:09:27,200 --> 03:09:30,480
Like, if I have, like, a lot of aura, at least I can pick everything up.

2930
03:09:31,620 --> 03:09:32,460
Oh my god, this is it.

2931
03:09:32,500 --> 03:09:33,360
This is a...

2932
03:09:33,360 --> 03:09:34,660
I'm doing it.

2933
03:09:37,320 --> 03:09:38,680
I'm theory crafting.

2934
03:09:40,800 --> 03:09:42,480
Am I just standing still?

2935
03:09:43,160 --> 03:09:43,820
Oh, it does knock.

2936
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:44,780
It's so hard to tell.

2937
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:47,820
But...

2938
03:09:47,820 --> 03:09:49,720
I'm not going to be greedy here.

2939
03:09:51,180 --> 03:09:51,820
That's right.

2940
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:53,880
Oh, that is not good.

2941
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:56,280
Size, tome, or death?

2942
03:09:56,300 --> 03:09:59,640
Oh, maybe damage tome or aura.

2943
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:03,520
Damage or damage tome or aura.

2944
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:06,000
Let the aura work for me.

2945
03:10:10,480 --> 03:10:10,820
What?

2946
03:10:11,260 --> 03:10:11,840
Oh my god.

2947
03:10:12,200 --> 03:10:12,940
Oh my god, guys.

2948
03:10:13,360 --> 03:10:15,240
I might need to be a little faster, though.

2949
03:10:15,440 --> 03:10:18,740
I didn't have to do more damage or be just a little bit.

2950
03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:19,560
I need life steal.

2951
03:10:21,500 --> 03:10:23,440
I think life steal would be so good for this.

2952
03:10:26,520 --> 03:10:29,100
Yeah, I need lifesteal really badly.

2953
03:10:33,020 --> 03:10:35,180
Yeah, to make this work, we need lifesteal.

2954
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:38,320
Oh my god, speaking of lifesteal.

2955
03:10:40,820 --> 03:10:43,220
Ask and ye shall receive.

2956
03:10:44,160 --> 03:10:45,100
Let's go.

2957
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:48,820
Nice.

2958
03:10:50,380 --> 03:10:51,920
We actually needed that.

2959
03:10:54,220 --> 03:10:55,600
Alright, that's right.

2960
03:10:56,180 --> 03:10:57,620
Stand near me.

2961
03:10:57,860 --> 03:10:59,960
You wish you could be as cool as me.

2962
03:11:01,460 --> 03:11:02,140
Oh, wait.

2963
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:04,980
Flame Walker might be good, too.

2964
03:11:08,940 --> 03:11:11,360
Because, like, Or, Aura.

2965
03:11:12,340 --> 03:11:14,220
Barely outspeeding the...

2966
03:11:14,220 --> 03:11:14,480
Okay.

2967
03:11:15,160 --> 03:11:15,640
You're right.

2968
03:11:15,880 --> 03:11:17,460
Why would I ever doubt Aura?

2969
03:11:20,420 --> 03:11:22,220
I feel like I need speed.

2970
03:11:22,480 --> 03:11:24,260
I might be a little too slow.

2971
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:28,060
Shield.

2972
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:30,780
Projectile.

2973
03:11:31,220 --> 03:11:31,700
I'll refresh.

2974
03:11:36,170 --> 03:11:37,030
Oh, wait.

2975
03:11:37,490 --> 03:11:39,090
Wouldn't chunkers be good with my build?

2976
03:11:50,310 --> 03:11:50,710
Right?

2977
03:11:51,190 --> 03:11:52,670
Because it's rock and aura.

2978
03:11:55,410 --> 03:11:55,870
Alright.

2979
03:11:57,050 --> 03:11:58,730
I just need to speed tome.

2980
03:11:58,990 --> 03:12:02,170
I think if I have a speed tome, it'll be really good.

2981
03:12:06,850 --> 03:12:10,030
So I like those who are like maybe too strong like these guys.

2982
03:12:10,290 --> 03:12:11,690
Like these guys.

2983
03:12:13,750 --> 03:12:14,270
Yeah.

2984
03:12:16,230 --> 03:12:17,990
I'm gonna try to find a speed tome.

2985
03:12:18,970 --> 03:12:20,430
And a size tome too.

2986
03:12:20,630 --> 03:12:21,650
Yeah, speed and size.

2987
03:12:27,090 --> 03:12:28,050
All right, more raw.

2988
03:12:30,390 --> 03:12:32,610
Okay, this should be fine because...

2989
03:12:35,270 --> 03:12:35,830
Oh, size!

2990
03:12:36,030 --> 03:12:36,270
Size!

2991
03:12:36,490 --> 03:12:36,630
Size tome!

2992
03:12:37,030 --> 03:12:38,370
All right, size tome, right?

2993
03:12:46,650 --> 03:12:47,090
Yeah.

2994
03:12:50,730 --> 03:12:51,250
Okay.

2995
03:12:51,950 --> 03:12:53,110
Let's make it bigger.

2996
03:12:54,330 --> 03:13:28,010
um hp uh chunky chunky rock okay we gotta go grab our oh my god look at this too much aura oh my god there we go too much aura can't get near me now they can't handle it oh shit does so much Okay, I want to see if the shady guy is selling anything good.

2997
03:13:29,430 --> 03:13:30,930
I need speed, though.

2998
03:13:32,390 --> 03:13:32,570
Damage.

2999
03:13:32,730 --> 03:13:33,730
Oh, fuck.

3000
03:13:33,910 --> 03:13:34,110
Okay.

3001
03:13:36,750 --> 03:13:39,330
I could skip and try and find.

3002
03:13:40,070 --> 03:13:44,650
Guys, should I skip or try and find speed?

3003
03:13:46,130 --> 03:13:47,450
Or take the damage to him.

3004
03:13:48,390 --> 03:13:49,470
Would be worth it.

3005
03:13:58,150 --> 03:13:59,330
Okay, skip for speed.

3006
03:13:59,630 --> 03:13:59,850
Alright.

3007
03:14:02,710 --> 03:14:04,590
I wonder if that gives me more rock.

3008
03:14:07,450 --> 03:14:08,550
Or do I do...

3009
03:14:09,290 --> 03:14:12,870
I wonder if this gives me another extra rock.

3010
03:14:16,910 --> 03:14:17,230
Yeah?

3011
03:14:17,590 --> 03:14:18,450
Alright, we'll get more.

3012
03:14:18,830 --> 03:14:19,290
Oh, it does.

3013
03:14:19,430 --> 03:14:19,670
Nice.

3014
03:14:21,110 --> 03:14:21,890
Oh, my God.

3015
03:14:22,250 --> 03:14:23,310
Oh, my God.

3016
03:14:24,830 --> 03:14:26,350
A lot of them.

3017
03:14:27,830 --> 03:14:28,770
Okay, we're gonna go here.

3018
03:14:30,770 --> 03:14:32,910
The only issue is how slow I am.

3019
03:14:32,910 --> 03:14:36,290
That's like my only... only great right now.

3020
03:14:36,490 --> 03:14:37,230
I'm so slow.

3021
03:14:38,230 --> 03:14:40,990
Do check

3022
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:45,660
out more rock.

3023
03:14:47,080 --> 03:14:48,820
I just walked so slow.

3024
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:56,160
Yeah, we gotta find... gotta find the boss.

3025
03:14:59,160 --> 03:14:59,980
More rock.

3026
03:15:02,820 --> 03:15:04,520
There must be something over here.

3027
03:15:06,920 --> 03:15:09,040
I'm flexing them away.

3028
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:13,060
I'm walking over here.

3029
03:15:13,160 --> 03:15:14,220
He's gotta have something.

3030
03:15:16,320 --> 03:15:17,720
Okay, we night- Oh, that's good.

3031
03:15:18,140 --> 03:15:19,520
That's actually so good.

3032
03:15:21,180 --> 03:15:22,140
Is there anything else here?

3033
03:15:24,700 --> 03:15:25,700
What's up there?

3034
03:15:26,040 --> 03:15:27,000
Oh, it's a challenge.

3035
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:27,400
Okay.

3036
03:15:30,200 --> 03:15:31,340
Get out of here.

3037
03:15:32,240 --> 03:15:33,020
Be gone!

3038
03:15:34,140 --> 03:15:35,220
Let me flex!

3039
03:15:37,900 --> 03:15:38,860
Evasion tome.

3040
03:15:40,240 --> 03:15:40,820
Okay, size.

3041
03:15:41,340 --> 03:15:42,060
Grab the size.

3042
03:15:42,220 --> 03:15:47,320
And then next one, if we can't find the speed, we'll grab the, uh, we'll grab the aura.

3043
03:15:50,200 --> 03:15:50,940
Holy shit.

3044
03:15:52,980 --> 03:15:54,540
This, this is bad.

3045
03:15:54,600 --> 03:16:02,100
I've yet to find, I've yet to find a single, uh, a mag, I have not found a magnet or a speed tome.

3046
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:04,920
And that's like what we need right now.

3047
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:05,940
That's right.

3048
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:10,240
Be gone.

3049
03:16:11,580 --> 03:16:14,920
You have no, you don't have enough aura to be near me.

3050
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:17,500
That's fucking right.

3051
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:24,620
Bigger.

3052
03:16:28,720 --> 03:16:30,880
Oh my god, I flexed fall damage too.

3053
03:16:32,480 --> 03:16:33,040
That's right.

3054
03:16:33,100 --> 03:16:33,540
Oh, there you go.

3055
03:16:33,680 --> 03:16:34,320
I found the boss.

3056
03:16:35,720 --> 03:16:36,900
That's fucking right.

3057
03:16:37,580 --> 03:16:39,880
Fall damage has nothing on me.

3058
03:16:40,740 --> 03:16:42,740
Flex the fall damage.

3059
03:16:45,260 --> 03:16:47,490
That's how good I am.

3060
03:16:53,170 --> 03:16:53,610
Okay.

3061
03:16:54,190 --> 03:16:54,710
Or HP.

3062
03:16:55,650 --> 03:16:56,570
That's always good.

3063
03:16:59,810 --> 03:17:01,830
Wow, I slowly head upstairs.

3064
03:17:03,550 --> 03:17:04,850
Very slowly.

3065
03:17:05,430 --> 03:17:09,630
We're slowly just walking over there.

3066
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:13,970
Just very slowly.

3067
03:17:14,030 --> 03:17:16,190
Heading over to the boss.

3068
03:17:18,530 --> 03:17:20,570
We're gonna make it.

3069
03:17:20,630 --> 03:17:23,110
We're gonna find Spotted or.

3070
03:17:23,690 --> 03:17:25,870

3071
03:17:25,910 --> 03:17:26,470
Guys.

3072
03:17:29,630 --> 03:17:30,610

03:17:35,730 --> 03:17:37,150
Do we get armor or quantity?

3077
03:17:37,710 --> 03:17:38,350

3078
03:17:38,590 --> 03:17:39,970
Yeah, we couldn't get the speed.

3079
03:17:40,230 --> 03:17:41,010

3085
03:17:51,230 --> 03:17:53,250
We're truly aura farming now.

3086
03:17:57,290 --> 03:17:58,410
Try to figure out how to get up there.

3087
03:17:58,710 --> 03:18:00,210
Holy shit, it's so far up.

3088

It's... Guys, you don't understand.

3103
03:19:32,850 --> 03:19:35,670
It takes so long to walk over there.

3104
03:19:35,730 --> 03:19:36,170
You know?

3105
03:19:37,630 --> 03:19:38,510
It's just...

3106
03:19:38,510 --> 03:19:41,190
It takes you... It's on high, high ground.

3107
03:19:45,470 --> 03:19:47,410
My guy don't have enough money, too.

3109
03:19:49,930 --> 03:19:50,930
You don't understand.

3110
03:19:51,410 --> 03:19:51,690
I've been trying.

3111
03:19:52,030 --> 03:19:56,110
I've been trying to walk over to the boss for so long.

3112
03:19:59,350 --> 03:20:01,150
He's all the way up here.

3113
03:20:01,970 --> 03:20:03,370
I gotta grab this though.

3114
03:20:07,830 --> 03:20:08,170
Oh my god.

3115
03:20:08,290 --> 03:20:08,670

I have to find this from here.

3118
03:20:12,850 --> 03:20:13,270
I don't know.

3119
03:20:13,310 --> 03:20:13,770
I'm scared.

3120
03:20:13,850 --> 03:20:15,430
I'm actually really scared about this one.

3121
03:20:15,810 --> 03:20:16,450
This is close.

3122
03:20:16,730 --> 03:20:17,630
Oh my god.

3123
03:20:17,750 --> 03:20:18,290
Thank god.

3124
03:20:18,770 --> 03:20:19,910
There's a magnet here.

3125
03:20:20,050 --> 03:20:22,310
That's so good for us.

3126
03:20:27,090 --> 03:20:27,590
Grab this.

3127
03:20:28,450 --> 03:20:28,650

I think I should have invested more in damage guys I might have messed up by not investing in damage Just maybe.

3147
03:22:00,580 --> 03:22:03,780
I have so much, but it's taking forever.

No!

3157
03:22:25,630 --> 03:22:28,850
It should have taken the damage.

3158
03:22:30,610 --> 03:22:31,970
It's too bad.

3159
03:22:31,970 --> 03:22:32,310
Good.

3160
03:22:32,390 --> 03:22:33,110

I need to do tier three.

3168
03:22:48,650 --> 03:22:48,810
Alright.

3169
03:22:50,590 --> 03:22:52,110

3170
03:22:52,210 --> 03:22:53,470
Oh my god, I had campfire.

3171
03:22:53,910 --> 03:22:55,790
I forgot about campfire.

3172

Alright.

3173
03:22:57,590 --> 03:22:59,170

3175
03:23:03,470 --> 03:23:04,810

3176
03:23:04,830 --> 03:23:05,910
the beef, guys.

3177
03:23:06,950 --> 03:23:10,870
I was through my attack speed because I'm an archer, right?

3178
03:23:13,570 --> 03:23:16,190
What build should I do for Robinette?

3179
03:23:18,110 --> 03:23:19,890
I got baited by the burger.

3180
03:23:23,250 --> 03:23:24,310
Maybe damage?

3181
03:23:25,230 --> 03:23:25,650
Hmm.

3182
03:23:31,650 --> 03:23:33,610
Projectile count and attack speed.

3183
03:23:33,870 --> 03:23:34,170
Okay.

3184
03:23:37,850 --> 03:23:38,190

Oh my god, why there's so many shady guys now?

3188
03:24:17,830 --> 03:24:18,190
Greed.

3189
03:24:19,010 --> 03:24:20,390
More greed, more money.

3190
03:24:21,790 --> 03:24:23,750
More money, less problems, right?

3191
03:24:23,810 --> 03:24:24,770
That's how it goes, right?

3192
03:24:27,850 --> 03:24:28,590
I missed a shot.

3193
03:24:28,690 --> 03:24:29,190
I'll come back.

3194
03:24:29,550 --> 03:24:30,630

Oh, I'm so fast.

3197
03:24:34,850 --> 03:24:35,310

03:24:49,630 --> 03:24:51,230
No, I bring a gun.

3202
03:24:51,870 --> 03:24:52,210
Do it?

3203
03:24:52,330 --> 03:24:52,650
All right.

3204
03:24:53,430 --> 03:24:54,270
We'll start shooting.

3205
03:24:56,790 --> 03:24:58,830
We'll bring a gun to a bow fight too.

3206
03:25:01,330 --> 03:25:01,870
There you go.

3207
03:25:05,670 --> 03:25:07,410
All right, I want to grab the upgrade here.

3208
03:25:08,570 --> 03:25:10,650
Okay, I need to focus on just getting money.

3209
03:25:12,050 --> 03:25:12,290
Wee!

3210
03:25:13,430 --> 03:25:14,110
Double jump.

3211
03:25:16,490 --> 03:25:31,230
Oh my god, I want to grab that skeleton, but I feel like Oh, no, I was so close Cool down or damn What do I want again?

3212

Attack speed.

3216
03:25:50,930 --> 03:25:51,330
Nice.

3217
03:25:52,130 --> 03:25:52,670
Come on.

3218
03:25:54,630 --> 03:25:55,250
Nice.

3219
03:25:56,390 --> 03:25:57,450
Oh my god.

3220
03:25:57,570 --> 03:25:57,890
That's what we need.

3221
03:25:58,030 --> 03:25:59,310
It's getting projectile speed.

3222
03:26:00,250 --> 03:26:01,210
Oh, we got so much.

3223
03:26:01,850 --> 03:26:02,450
It's good.

3224
03:26:04,090 --> 03:26:04,710
Jeez.

3225
03:26:06,510 --> 03:26:06,830
Nice.

3226
03:26:07,990 --> 03:26:08,370
Alright.

3227
03:26:08,770 --> 03:26:10,150
We just gotta keep hoarding money.

3228
03:26:13,570 --> 03:26:14,250
Go, go, go, go.

3229
03:26:15,150 --> 03:26:15,490
Go, go.

3230
03:26:16,090 --> 03:26:19,690
Okay, attack and projectile.

3231
03:26:21,530 --> 03:26:22,750
Let's just keep shooting.

3232
03:26:23,870 --> 03:26:25,070
Don't open any chests.

3233
03:26:25,350 --> 03:26:26,530
Oh, it's so tempting, though.

3234
03:26:27,470 --> 03:26:27,830
Whoa.

3235
03:26:30,390 --> 03:26:31,530
That's so tempting.

3236
03:26:32,310 --> 03:26:34,310
It's like begging me to open them.

3237
03:26:35,250 --> 03:26:38,070
Oh, but then I realized I can't get, like, life skills and stuff, too.

3238
03:26:38,710 --> 03:26:42,350
I mean, I can from these, but it's going to be, like, very risky.

3239
03:26:48,320 --> 03:26:48,560
eat.

3240
03:26:49,240 --> 03:26:49,760
That's always good.

3241
03:26:49,940 --> 03:26:51,040
Oh my god, I'm so weak.

3242
03:26:51,860 --> 03:26:53,020
Please, does anyone have a burger?

3243
03:26:53,820 --> 03:26:55,900
Does anyone have a burger for little ome?

3244
03:27:00,950 --> 03:27:02,530
I just need a burger.

3245
03:27:04,370 --> 03:27:04,850
Pacor.

3246
03:27:09,160 --> 03:27:09,660
Bo.

3247
03:27:10,620 --> 03:27:11,040
All right.

3248
03:27:13,440 --> 03:27:14,180
Oh my god.

3249
03:27:14,500 --> 03:27:16,020
Oh my god, that's not fair.

3250
03:27:16,860 --> 03:27:21,120
Oh, okay.

3251
03:27:21,440 --> 03:27:22,860
I don't like it.

3252
03:27:22,880 --> 03:27:27,980
I think, guys, she is very hard.

3253
03:27:33,130 --> 03:27:35,190
I can already tell.

3254
03:27:36,310 --> 03:27:37,330
I can already tell.

3255
03:27:37,450 --> 03:27:39,230
You know who was the best one?

3256
03:27:40,110 --> 03:27:40,650
Monkey.

3257
03:27:44,370 --> 03:27:47,390
I think we gotta get tier three.

3258
03:27:47,610 --> 03:27:49,470
I have to get tier three.

3259
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:53,570
I think Monkey has never failed me.

3260
03:27:55,150 --> 03:27:56,830
He is truly...

3261
03:27:58,750 --> 03:27:59,750
It's time.

3262
03:28:00,210 --> 03:28:01,450
We had the best build.

3263
03:28:01,830 --> 03:28:02,830
It's time to clap.

3264
03:28:06,870 --> 03:28:09,250
Monkey will never disappoint.

3265
03:28:11,850 --> 03:28:12,530
Okay, wait.

3266
03:28:12,730 --> 03:28:15,130
Alright, let's grab...

3267
03:28:15,130 --> 03:28:16,690
Nice thunder god monkey.

3268
03:28:19,210 --> 03:28:20,450
Definitely projectile.

3269
03:28:21,150 --> 03:28:21,530
Definitely.

3270
03:28:21,930 --> 03:28:22,850
No, I...

3271
03:28:22,850 --> 03:28:23,470
For sure.

3272
03:28:25,590 --> 03:28:26,770
Can't afford it yet.

3273
03:28:27,350 --> 03:28:27,350
Almost.

3274
03:28:28,030 --> 03:28:28,550
There we go.

3275
03:28:30,050 --> 03:28:30,430
Oh, nice.

3276
03:28:30,610 --> 03:28:31,730
Okay, movement speed.

3277
03:28:33,030 --> 03:28:33,670
Banana stonks.

3278
03:28:36,550 --> 03:28:37,470
Alright, nice.

3279
03:28:38,690 --> 03:28:39,430
I think the...

3280
03:28:39,430 --> 03:28:41,610
I think projectile quantity...

3281
03:28:41,610 --> 03:28:42,330
I don't know what else.

3282
03:28:42,530 --> 03:28:42,810
What do we...

3283
03:28:42,810 --> 03:28:44,830
What tone should we do with the...

3284
03:28:45,730 --> 03:28:46,550
With it?

3285
03:28:48,070 --> 03:28:48,590
Uh...

3286
03:28:48,590 --> 03:28:49,230
Size.

3287
03:28:49,730 --> 03:28:50,130
Bigger.

3288
03:28:50,930 --> 03:28:51,930
Bigger banana.

3289
03:28:53,290 --> 03:28:53,810
Bigger banana.

3290
03:28:54,830 --> 03:28:56,130
They'll grab difficulty.

3291
03:28:59,290 --> 03:29:02,910
Bigger banana means stronger monkey.

3292
03:29:05,610 --> 03:29:07,210
Projectile speed damage or crit?

3293
03:29:08,310 --> 03:29:09,030
One, two, or three?

3294
03:29:09,750 --> 03:29:10,810
We gotta make it to tier three.

3295
03:29:11,050 --> 03:29:12,050
I wanna be in tier three.

3296
03:29:16,420 --> 03:29:16,900
Damage?

3297
03:29:17,680 --> 03:29:18,640
Okay, damage.

3298
03:29:20,960 --> 03:29:21,560
All right, nice.

3299
03:29:21,660 --> 03:29:22,580
There's another one too.

3300
03:29:23,960 --> 03:29:24,620
Grab this.

3301
03:29:25,200 --> 03:29:25,940
There's a chest.

3302
03:29:26,960 --> 03:29:27,520
It's fine.

3303
03:29:27,840 --> 03:29:29,340
I'm slowly throwing my banana over.

3304
03:29:29,640 --> 03:29:30,360
Oh, crit chance.

3305
03:29:30,820 --> 03:29:30,820
Nice.

3306
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:34,420
Okay, I'm getting a little greedy now.

3307
03:29:35,460 --> 03:29:36,300
I'm getting impatient.

3308
03:29:40,020 --> 03:29:41,000
I would say...

3309
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,400
Okay, we could refresh it.

3310
03:29:45,280 --> 03:29:45,840
Or...

3311
03:29:45,840 --> 03:29:46,620
Get the damage.

3312
03:29:47,480 --> 03:29:49,100
Because what else do we need other than quantity?

3313
03:29:50,120 --> 03:29:51,220
Do you think damage is enough?

3314
03:29:57,950 --> 03:29:58,510
Knockback.

3315
03:29:58,810 --> 03:29:59,130
Really?

3316
03:30:00,430 --> 03:30:00,990
Okay.

3317
03:30:01,490 --> 03:30:04,210
I don't know what else do we need other than quantity.

3318
03:30:05,770 --> 03:30:06,910
Maybe projectile speed?

3319
03:30:08,810 --> 03:30:09,510
Cool down.

3320
03:30:09,850 --> 03:30:10,350
Oh, nice.

3321
03:30:10,510 --> 03:30:11,190
We got cool down.

3322
03:30:12,230 --> 03:30:13,090
That's actually what we needed.

3323
03:30:14,250 --> 03:30:14,850
Okay, we got it.

3324
03:30:14,950 --> 03:30:16,230
We got the banana build.

3325
03:30:18,930 --> 03:30:19,610
Back to the...

3326
03:30:19,610 --> 03:30:20,210
Okay, nice.

3327
03:30:20,790 --> 03:30:21,570
Got this.

3328
03:30:22,790 --> 03:30:24,070
That was a good refresh.

3329
03:30:24,350 --> 03:30:25,670
That was actually so good for us.

3330
03:30:28,030 --> 03:30:29,410
Monkey jump now.

3331
03:30:30,070 --> 03:30:30,090

3332
03:30:30,790 --> 03:30:31,170

We're fine.

3343
03:31:44,110 --> 03:31:44,830
We're so healthy.

3344
03:31:45,370 --> 03:31:46,370
We're so healthy.

3345
03:31:49,310 --> 03:31:49,810
Go down.

3346
03:31:51,250 --> 03:31:51,770
Quantity.

3347
03:31:52,210 --> 03:31:53,410
And then we'll do banana next.

3348
03:31:57,090 --> 03:31:58,070
We actually need more banana.

3349
03:31:58,310 --> 03:32:00,290
There's more... Okay, there's a magnet over here.

3350
03:32:00,330 --> 03:32:00,750
That's good.

3351
03:32:03,330 --> 03:32:05,290
Oh my god, there's so many magnets actually.

You need that.

03:32:17,410 --> 03:32:18,590
Okay, we're so strong now.

Okay, that's karma.

3365
03:32:27,150 --> 03:32:29,130
I didn't think he clapped back.

3366
03:32:29,190 --> 03:32:29,870
He died.

3367
03:32:31,230 --> 03:32:56,080

Yay!

3373
03:33:15,700 --> 03:33:16,940
Streamer privilege!

3374
03:33:19,740 --> 03:33:21,260
Let's go!

3375
03:33:27,200 --> 03:33:28,680
Another one?

3376
03:33:30,100 --> 03:33:31,560
Does it do like times two damage?

3377
03:33:32,320 --> 03:33:33,440
Like, what the fuck?

3378
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:36,440
Oh no, this is where it, man.

3379
03:33:36,920 --> 03:33:37,680
Should be fine, right?

3380
03:33:38,920 --> 03:33:39,960
Right, right, guys?

3381
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:41,120
I should be fine.

3382
03:33:42,240 --> 03:33:43,580
Why are you sick?

3383
03:33:46,280 --> 03:33:47,340
Yeah, we're doing it.

3384
03:33:48,580 --> 03:33:50,720
Wait, how about I haven't found the boss yet, I just realized.

3385
03:33:51,740 --> 03:33:52,920
I guess I haven't found the boss yet.

3386
03:33:53,120 --> 03:33:54,200
That's fine, it's fine.

3387
03:33:54,420 --> 03:33:55,920
I gotta find it.

3388
03:33:57,140 --> 03:33:58,480
Let me grab this real quick.

3389
03:34:01,200 --> 03:34:01,640
Okay.

3390
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:07,940
Do I want thorns or pick up range?

3391
03:34:08,880 --> 03:34:10,520
I'm so happy for you.

3392
03:34:13,960 --> 03:34:15,080
Pick up?

3393
03:34:17,540 --> 03:34:18,000
All right.

3394
03:34:23,540 --> 03:34:25,660
Banana will never disappoint me.

3395
03:34:26,720 --> 03:34:32,120
I remember the reason why my monkey was so strong too last time was because I had the credit card.

3396
03:34:33,820 --> 03:34:34,420
Oh, fuck.

3397
03:34:34,560 --> 03:34:34,820
Okay.

3398
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:37,020
I don't know what to pick here.

3399
03:34:43,230 --> 03:34:47,150
Because I was opening so many chests and I kept having, like, damage?

3400
03:34:47,950 --> 03:34:48,190
Alright.

3401
03:34:49,950 --> 03:34:53,830
But I haven't found, I haven't found, like, the credit card in a while.

3402
03:34:58,390 --> 03:34:59,490
And movement speed.

3403
03:35:00,430 --> 03:35:01,110
Oh, grab this.

3404
03:35:01,230 --> 03:35:02,170
Just, just cause.

3405
03:35:02,950 --> 03:35:04,550
I feel like it's fine to grab it.

3406
03:35:04,630 --> 03:35:05,470
Oh, did I not grab it?

3407
03:35:05,610 --> 03:35:06,510
Oh, fuck, I didn't.

3408
03:35:08,090 --> 03:35:09,750
It's because I feel like I killed a lot already.

3409
03:35:10,470 --> 03:35:10,890
Okay.

3410
03:35:10,910 --> 03:35:12,450
Oh, shit.

3411
03:35:12,670 --> 03:35:13,490
Okay, lightning staff.

3412
03:35:17,050 --> 03:35:17,050
Nice.

3413
03:35:17,890 --> 03:35:17,890
Banana.

3414
03:35:19,870 --> 03:35:20,890
We'll do cooldowns.

3415
03:35:23,170 --> 03:35:23,430
Banana.

3416
03:35:26,810 --> 03:35:27,570
Cooled out.

3417
03:35:28,570 --> 03:35:28,570
Lightning.

3418
03:35:29,230 --> 03:35:29,750
Quantity.

3419
03:35:31,130 --> 03:35:31,670
Quantity.

3420
03:35:32,530 --> 03:35:33,230
I see purple.

3421
03:35:33,330 --> 03:35:34,250
I think it's good.

3422
03:35:35,870 --> 03:35:36,470
Oh, shit.

3423
03:35:36,790 --> 03:35:37,750
Life's still a crit.

3424
03:35:39,230 --> 03:35:40,210
I feel crit.

3425
03:35:40,390 --> 03:35:40,750
It's blue.

3426
03:35:40,910 --> 03:35:42,910
Blue means more.

3427
03:35:45,350 --> 03:35:45,370
Words.

3428
03:35:48,910 --> 03:35:50,810
I'll just sit here.

3429
03:35:51,930 --> 03:35:52,610
Yay, campfire!

3430
03:35:55,990 --> 03:35:57,010
Oh, we'll do damage.

3431
03:35:57,270 --> 03:35:58,330
Damage is always nice.

3432
03:35:59,910 --> 03:36:00,710
Oh wait, I'm poor.

3433
03:36:01,950 --> 03:36:02,630
How did that happen?

3434
03:36:05,970 --> 03:36:06,650
No!

3435
03:36:08,030 --> 03:36:09,610
How did I become poor?

3436
03:36:11,090 --> 03:36:12,370
Did I...

3437
03:36:12,370 --> 03:36:13,490
Did I spend it all?

3438
03:36:13,570 --> 03:36:13,890
No.

3439
03:36:14,470 --> 03:36:15,810
It's because I spent it all on bananas?

3440
03:36:15,990 --> 03:36:17,130
No, that can't be it.

3441
03:36:17,690 --> 03:36:17,990
No.

3442
03:36:20,430 --> 03:36:21,770
There's no way.

3443
03:36:23,190 --> 03:36:24,950
Monkey don't need money.

3444
03:36:25,670 --> 03:36:27,270
Monkey only needs banana.

3445
03:36:31,510 --> 03:36:32,670
More damage.

3446
03:36:34,690 --> 03:36:36,190
Banana is life.

3447
03:36:38,010 --> 03:36:39,010
Was that the cursing?

3448
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:40,890
Okay, it is.

3449
03:36:41,170 --> 03:36:41,730
That's fine.

3450
03:36:42,350 --> 03:36:42,790
Monkey died.

3451
03:36:42,950 --> 03:37:05,810

3452
03:37:11,350 --> 03:37:17,370
banana there you go It's a stupid boss fight.

3453
03:37:17,470 --> 03:37:17,950
I'll climb.

3454
03:37:19,550 --> 03:37:20,710
I'll find it eventually.

3455
03:37:28,140 --> 03:37:28,900
Oh, projectile count.

3456
03:37:29,080 --> 03:37:29,760
More projectile.

3457
03:37:30,680 --> 03:37:32,820
More projectile is always good.

3458
03:37:35,620 --> 03:37:36,540
Uh, blue.

3459
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:38,580
Oh, this is bad.

3460
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:40,580
I still haven't found the...

3461
03:37:41,260 --> 03:37:42,880
Where the fuck is it?

3462
03:37:43,040 --> 03:37:43,260
Oh!

3463
03:37:43,940 --> 03:37:44,400
Please, please.

3464
03:37:44,600 --> 03:37:45,360
Oh my god, it's fine.

3465
03:37:45,460 --> 03:37:45,760
It's okay.

3466
03:37:45,900 --> 03:37:46,240
It's okay.

3467
03:37:47,920 --> 03:37:48,660
There's 23.

3468
03:37:49,700 --> 03:37:50,560
There was 23 there.

3469
03:37:50,580 --> 03:37:50,880
damage.

3470
03:37:52,100 --> 03:37:52,820
That's okay.

3471
03:37:54,600 --> 03:37:55,580
I'll go this way.

3472
03:37:55,960 --> 03:37:56,760
Maybe I'll find it here.

3473
03:38:02,330 --> 03:38:04,090
Charging a charge will turn into a healing zone.

3474
03:38:04,250 --> 03:38:05,470
Also spawn plus two.

3475
03:38:05,850 --> 03:38:06,410
We'll do that.

3476
03:38:07,770 --> 03:38:09,730
We're always doing stuff like that.

3477
03:38:10,490 --> 03:38:11,270
Go down.

3478
03:38:15,270 --> 03:38:15,770
More.

3479
03:38:18,430 --> 03:38:19,390
God, I hate the ghost.

3480
03:38:19,410 --> 03:38:21,590
The ghost is so, like, what is it?

3481
03:38:21,850 --> 03:38:22,630
It's so useless.

3482
03:38:23,750 --> 03:38:26,090
I find a ghost one to really use this.

3483
03:38:28,030 --> 03:38:28,690
Where the fuck?

3484
03:38:30,590 --> 03:38:32,090
Holy shit, there's so many people here.

3485
03:38:32,430 --> 03:38:32,690
You know what?

3486
03:38:32,870 --> 03:38:33,910
We'll be better if we add more.

3487
03:38:36,170 --> 03:38:38,010
Oh my god, there's so many people.

3488
03:38:38,170 --> 03:38:38,810
Let's add more.

3489
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:45,230
Where the fuck is the fucking boss room?

3490
03:38:47,750 --> 03:38:48,710
Oh no.

3491
03:38:50,210 --> 03:38:51,930
I feel like I've been everywhere.

3492
03:38:58,820 --> 03:39:00,720
I don't want to fight the ghost.

3493
03:39:01,640 --> 03:39:02,100
What's this?

3494
03:39:02,680 --> 03:39:03,280
Why is money?

3495
03:39:04,600 --> 03:39:05,180
Money time.

3496
03:39:05,460 --> 03:39:06,360
Money, money, money.

3497
03:39:07,120 --> 03:39:08,160
Money, money.

3498
03:39:08,900 --> 03:39:09,680
Money, money.

3499
03:39:10,360 --> 03:39:12,820
Money, money, money.

3500
03:39:13,300 --> 03:39:14,380
Oh shit, it's Chuckles.

3501
03:39:15,300 --> 03:39:16,320
It's Chuckles the rat.

3502
03:39:16,740 --> 03:39:17,900
Oh, goodbye, Chuckles the rat.

3503
03:39:20,340 --> 03:39:21,300
I want...

3504
03:39:21,300 --> 03:39:23,040
I found everything but the boss.

3505
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:25,500
Oh, there it is.

3506
03:39:25,580 --> 03:39:26,000
I found it.

3507
03:39:28,080 --> 03:39:29,540
I did it.

3508
03:39:29,600 --> 03:39:29,760
Yay.

3509
03:39:31,180 --> 03:39:31,880
There's something.

3510
03:39:32,020 --> 03:39:32,920
Oh, there's experience.

3511
03:39:34,320 --> 03:39:35,380
This is minus 20.

3512
03:39:36,180 --> 03:39:37,400
I just boomed, but stopped them.

3513
03:39:37,980 --> 03:39:38,440
Let's go.

3514
03:39:38,660 --> 03:39:39,380
I'm gaming.

3515
03:39:42,300 --> 03:39:43,400
Alright, I think I can fight him now.

3516
03:39:43,640 --> 03:39:44,280
I'll fight him now.

3517
03:39:45,020 --> 03:39:45,280
Fuck it.

3518
03:39:46,120 --> 03:39:48,160
I'm not as strong as last time.

3519
03:39:48,880 --> 03:39:50,600
But, like, I think I'm pretty strong.

3520
03:39:55,010 --> 03:39:55,650
Alright, nice.

3521
03:39:58,290 --> 03:39:59,050
Come play.

3522
03:39:59,770 --> 03:40:00,390
a couple.

3523
03:40:01,390 --> 03:40:01,830
Watch this.

3524
03:40:03,830 --> 03:40:04,550
Come on, Tom.

3525
03:40:05,370 --> 03:40:05,630
Come on!

3526
03:40:07,050 --> 03:40:11,390
I didn't think you would summon it right in front of me.

3527
03:40:13,150 --> 03:40:14,470
Oh my God.

3528
03:40:14,690 --> 03:40:15,610
Okay, not gonna lie.

3529
03:40:15,670 --> 03:40:19,430
This is so much stronger than than aura farming.

3530
03:40:19,970 --> 03:40:22,990
Like, you can't deny this is not stronger.

3531
03:40:27,530 --> 03:40:29,090
Oh, oh my God.

3532
03:40:29,150 --> 03:41:00,070
Now I okay that's fine now at least i have the credit card now banana i think i can oh my god magnet too we'll get banana ram projectile or farm a little bit because we're here let's farm a little bit here since i can let's find a little bit of that money hurt.

3533
03:41:00,730 --> 03:41:01,430
It won't hurt.

3534
03:41:01,790 --> 03:41:02,590
Just a little bit.

3535
03:41:04,150 --> 03:41:05,030
Just a little bit.

3536
03:41:06,110 --> 03:41:06,330
There you go.

3537
03:41:06,730 --> 03:41:06,910
120.

3538
03:41:07,630 --> 03:41:11,050
I'm like right next to it so there's no way it can just kill me.

3539
03:41:11,450 --> 03:41:11,450
Right?

3540
03:41:12,050 --> 03:41:13,290
There's no way.

3541
03:41:14,030 --> 03:41:15,370
Surely it won't, right?

3542
03:41:17,190 --> 03:41:19,550
Just I'm literally right next to it.

3543
03:41:19,670 --> 03:41:23,370
So like if things go very, very wrong, don't worry.

3544
03:41:25,330 --> 03:41:26,750
Do not worry.

3545
03:41:26,950 --> 03:41:29,190
If things go very wrong.

3546
03:41:30,170 --> 03:42:01,350
okay nice banana ram surely right I saw a farm this here though oh my god I'm going in I'm going I saw like a giant crowd forming around me and I knew I knew it was my time to go I can do I was playing with fate okay more shroud not doing the green I I think when you're on the second map,

3547
03:42:01,530 --> 03:42:02,430
I can't do the green.

3548
03:42:04,030 --> 03:42:06,570
Okay, we gotta find as many upgrades as possible.

3549
03:42:07,950 --> 03:42:10,330
Okay, this gives me two more charge stations.

3550
03:42:15,650 --> 03:42:16,730
I think crit damage.

3551
03:42:20,420 --> 03:42:21,380
Okay, we got five more.

3552
03:42:22,860 --> 03:42:24,060
Oh, but first, a chest.

3553
03:42:25,080 --> 03:42:26,440
Oh, fuck, I'm poor.

3554
03:42:27,680 --> 03:42:28,540
Never mind.

3555
03:42:29,100 --> 03:42:29,740
No chest.

3556
03:42:33,580 --> 03:42:33,860
Okay.

3557
03:42:35,700 --> 03:42:36,060
man.

3558
03:42:38,580 --> 03:42:39,400
Wait, there's gold.

3559
03:42:39,660 --> 03:42:40,980
Wait, I've never seen the gold one before.

3560
03:42:42,480 --> 03:42:44,960
I don't know if I have high... Wait, what does this give me?

3561
03:42:45,740 --> 03:42:46,780
That has to be OP.

3562
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:50,460
We'll light up some smores.

3563
03:42:51,960 --> 03:42:54,260
Oh my God.

3564
03:42:54,500 --> 03:42:56,980
Okay, we have... Oh, fuck.

3565
03:42:57,320 --> 03:42:58,500
I don't think gold is that important.

3566
03:42:58,960 --> 03:43:00,320
Ah, okay, the thing is?

3567
03:43:02,080 --> 03:43:02,760
Oh, this is hard.

3568
03:43:03,080 --> 03:43:06,340
Because, like, um, more gold, I can open more chests.

3569
03:43:07,320 --> 03:43:10,300
I can open more chests, and then I can get more damage upgrades.

3570
03:43:10,640 --> 03:43:12,520
But then I also, there's also HP regen.

3571
03:43:13,380 --> 03:43:14,420
Uh, I'll go with regen.

3572
03:43:14,680 --> 03:43:15,120
I'll go with regen.

3573
03:43:16,160 --> 03:43:16,960
I didn't want to go with regen.

3574
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:24,040
Oh, I'll go with regen, just in case.

3575
03:43:26,940 --> 03:43:29,300
I can maybe farm, maybe I can farm the gold.

3576
03:43:30,400 --> 03:43:30,720
Maybe.

3577
03:43:30,860 --> 03:43:32,280
Maybe I'll find another one that does gold.

3578
03:43:33,680 --> 03:43:36,400
Oh, I don't know if I made a bad choice there.

3579
03:43:36,740 --> 03:43:41,180
I'm just thinking like, I'm thinking like, I can open more chests so that...

3580
03:43:41,180 --> 03:43:41,620
Wait, what?

3581
03:43:43,520 --> 03:43:45,200
Wait, okay, we gotta get that.

3582
03:43:45,400 --> 03:43:46,260
Wait, how much was that?

3583
03:43:48,200 --> 03:43:49,560
Thousand, okay, that's fine.

3584
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:50,160
Go save that.

3585
03:43:51,140 --> 03:43:52,140
That's a lot of damage.

3586
03:43:52,700 --> 03:43:53,500
That's a lot of damage.

3587
03:43:56,360 --> 03:43:57,740
Okay, I gotta grab this.

3588
03:43:58,960 --> 03:44:00,400
That's so much damage, too.

3589
03:44:02,420 --> 03:44:02,820
Okay.

3590
03:44:04,160 --> 03:44:04,760
Uh...

3591
03:44:05,720 --> 03:44:07,880
I don't care about silver enough.

3592
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:10,800
I don't think it's worth it for me.

3593
03:44:11,760 --> 03:44:12,980
Compared to everything else.

3594
03:44:14,040 --> 03:44:16,200
I'd rather focus on the now, you know?

3595
03:44:17,940 --> 03:44:22,860
I'll focus on the now rather than like...

3596
03:44:22,860 --> 03:44:23,300
Lightning.

3597
03:44:26,300 --> 03:44:26,900
Uh...

3598
03:44:27,480 --> 03:44:28,700
Okay, nice more XP.

3599
03:44:29,460 --> 03:44:30,460
More XP is always good.

3600
03:44:31,220 --> 03:44:32,900
you're so close

3601
03:44:37,470 --> 03:45:09,530

Oh, my God.

3618
03:46:08,150 --> 03:46:09,930

03:46:30,530 --> 03:46:30,950
I don't know.

3627
03:46:31,030 --> 03:46:32,150
I don't know if speed is good.

3628
03:46:33,370 --> 03:46:33,850
Three?

3629
03:46:34,330 --> 03:46:34,670

03:46:35,710 --> 03:46:36,530

03:46:36,850 --> 03:46:37,450
That's the thing.

3632
03:46:39,190 --> 03:46:41,490
I can't tell if speed would be a good investment.

3633
03:46:42,190 --> 03:46:42,990
Oh my god, we have enough.

3634
03:46:43,770 --> 03:46:44,950

03:46:48,770 --> 03:46:50,010

3643
03:47:09,370 --> 03:47:11,970
He was near some cliffs.

3644
03:47:12,070 --> 03:47:13,210
Oh, that's so tough.

3645
03:47:17,730 --> 03:47:19,370

3716
03:53:53,880 --> 03:53:54,220

03:54:08,920 --> 03:54:11,520
I needed more damage.

3719
03:54:14,500 --> 03:54:16,680
Make them skill-ish.

3720
03:54:17,860 --> 03:54:20,080
I wanna get the tier three!

3721
03:54:22,020 --> 03:54:22,440
Oh!

03:54:23,320 --> 03:54:25,140
I need to upgrade banana more.

3723
03:54:25,220 --> 03:54:28,300
Okay, is I... Do I focus on banana upgrades?

3724
03:54:31,320 --> 03:54:33,040
Okay, there's fire blades.

3725
03:54:35,740 --> 03:54:36,380
Poor monkey.

3726
03:54:36,680 --> 03:54:38,820
I'm a very poor monkey now.

3727
03:54:41,040 --> 03:54:43,460
All right, we focus on banana.

3728
03:54:44,780 --> 03:54:45,960
I need damage.

3729
03:54:46,080 --> 03:54:46,300
Okay.

3730
03:54:48,160 --> 03:54:49,620
All right, we got this.

3731
03:54:49,780 --> 03:54:50,540
Back to monkey.

3732
03:54:53,180 --> 03:54:54,380
I believe...

3733
03:54:54,380 --> 03:54:55,200
Guys, I don't think...

3734
03:54:55,220 --> 03:54:56,720
aura would clutch this.

3735
03:55:01,260 --> 03:55:01,420
Okay.

3736
03:55:02,440 --> 03:55:03,560
We focus on banana.

3737
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:05,560
Banana's the key.

3738
03:55:06,660 --> 03:55:07,600
I'll do glee here.

3739
03:55:12,790 --> 03:55:14,210
Can't embrace it.

3740
03:55:18,750 --> 03:55:21,730
Aura would absolutely not clutch it and you know it.

3741
03:55:22,290 --> 03:55:22,650
Alright.

3742
03:55:23,630 --> 03:55:23,870
Alright.

3743
03:55:24,110 --> 03:55:24,610
Speed.

3744
03:55:25,230 --> 03:55:26,370
Projectile speed.

3745
03:55:26,850 --> 03:55:26,850
Banana.

3746
03:55:27,150 --> 03:55:30,830
Projectile speed and What else?

3747
03:55:31,130 --> 03:55:32,110
What tome do we do again?

3748
03:55:32,450 --> 03:55:32,710
Damage?

3749
03:55:38,770 --> 03:55:39,870
Where did the monster?

3750
03:55:40,050 --> 03:55:40,790
Oh, there he is.

3751
03:55:41,770 --> 03:55:42,090
And damage.

3752
03:55:42,250 --> 03:55:44,770
Do we do projectile speed and damage tome then?

3753
03:55:49,310 --> 03:55:49,570
Okay.

3754
03:55:52,410 --> 03:55:53,570
Damage tome might help.

3755
03:55:53,910 --> 03:55:53,910
Okay.

3756
03:55:55,570 --> 03:55:56,890
Oh, bloody tome!

3757
03:55:58,850 --> 03:55:59,930
I don't know.

3758
03:56:02,910 --> 03:56:04,210
Nah, it's not worth it, right?

3759
03:56:04,630 --> 03:56:05,770
Yeah, we'll do boomerang.

3760
03:56:08,130 --> 03:56:09,530
Let's just focus on banana.

3761
03:56:11,550 --> 03:56:12,110
Banana strong.

3762
03:56:15,490 --> 03:56:16,410
Banana strong.

3763
03:56:19,990 --> 03:56:21,190
Silver Tome.

3764
03:56:21,770 --> 03:56:22,150
Firestaff.

3765
03:56:22,430 --> 03:56:23,410
Refresher now.

3766
03:56:33,510 --> 03:56:35,430
Is Firestaff good or should we just refresh it?

3767
03:56:40,370 --> 03:56:40,750
Refresh.

3768
03:56:40,890 --> 03:56:41,050
Alright.

3769
03:56:41,870 --> 03:56:43,210
Oh, projectile speed.

3770
03:56:43,950 --> 03:56:44,710
That's good, right?

3771
03:56:45,070 --> 03:56:45,810
Or do we skip?

3772
03:56:50,160 --> 03:56:52,020
Uh, or banish.

3773
03:56:52,080 --> 03:56:54,080
We could banish, we'll banish Flamewalker.

3774
03:56:55,960 --> 03:56:56,400
Projectile speed?

3775
03:56:56,820 --> 03:56:57,640
Is it worth it?

3776
03:56:58,720 --> 03:56:59,020
Alright.

3777
03:57:01,240 --> 03:57:03,440
Okay, it's either we get...

3778
03:57:03,440 --> 03:57:08,460
Okay, since we have projectile speed, we have to either get cooldown, which is worth more.

3779
03:57:08,680 --> 03:57:10,280
Quill down or damage, chat.

3780
03:57:10,780 --> 03:57:12,180
What do you think was worth more?

3781
03:57:19,830 --> 03:57:24,410
I don't know if I should do damage tome or, uh, cool.

3782
03:57:24,430 --> 03:57:57,450

3783
03:57:57,830 --> 03:57:59,310
we'll do this.

3784
03:58:02,350 --> 03:58:03,070
Or...

3785
03:58:03,070 --> 03:58:04,350
No, it's not.

3786
03:58:04,610 --> 03:58:06,650
Guys, it's not the plan.

3787
03:58:07,530 --> 03:58:09,390
Banana has given...

3788
03:58:09,390 --> 03:58:11,630
Has clutched me so far.

3789
03:58:13,790 --> 03:58:14,270
Alright.

3790
03:58:15,430 --> 03:58:15,730
Oh, wait.

3791
03:58:15,790 --> 03:58:16,690
This is a good area.

3792
03:58:19,590 --> 03:58:20,490
Wait, this is...

3793
03:58:20,490 --> 03:58:22,910
Wait, I'm literally surrounded by upgrades.

3794
03:58:23,010 --> 03:58:23,830
Wait, what the fuck?

3795
03:58:24,230 --> 03:58:25,510
That's crazy.

3796
03:58:26,810 --> 03:58:29,290
I'm gonna mess up this RNG or not.

3797
03:58:32,380 --> 03:58:33,720
Oh, 100%.

3798
03:58:33,720 --> 03:58:34,960
I'm gonna fuck it up.

3799
03:58:40,970 --> 03:58:41,830
Knock back.

3800
03:58:42,730 --> 03:58:43,390
Grab this.

3801
03:58:43,510 --> 03:58:44,910
And we have the boss area, too.

3802
03:58:45,570 --> 03:58:46,310
Thank God.

3803
03:58:47,310 --> 03:58:47,570
Banana.

3804
03:58:51,310 --> 03:58:52,030
Uh...

3805
03:58:52,030 --> 03:58:53,150
Movement speed or...

3806
03:58:53,150 --> 03:58:54,270
Uh, one or three?

3807
03:58:54,890 --> 03:58:57,230
Should I be faster or more projectile?

3808
03:59:00,840 --> 03:59:01,560
Three?

3809
03:59:02,240 --> 03:59:02,700
Okay.

3810
03:59:06,000 --> 03:59:16,000
Oh my god, we're actually surrounded by upgrades right now I'll come back to you later because I don't have money And then

3811
03:59:24,150 --> 03:59:41,290
Regen Reflect Kakumba stomped Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Cool down You need that

3812
03:59:45,690 --> 03:59:48,690
I think jumping actually has helped us a bit more.

3813
03:59:49,470 --> 03:59:49,910
Okay, beer.

3814
03:59:50,350 --> 03:59:50,650
Nice.

3815
03:59:51,110 --> 03:59:51,330
B.O.

3816
03:59:51,610 --> 03:59:52,170
Claw.

3817
03:59:54,590 --> 03:59:55,110
I don't mean that.

3818
03:59:57,390 --> 03:59:59,570
I'm trying so hard not to be greedy.

3819
04:00:00,790 --> 04:00:01,050
Alright.

3820
04:00:04,290 --> 04:00:05,570
We have cooldown.

3821
04:00:08,150 --> 04:00:11,350
We get damage tome or refresh and try to get...

3822
04:00:11,370 --> 04:00:12,710
get projectiles home.

3823
04:00:14,510 --> 04:00:14,770
Damage?

3824
04:00:15,230 --> 04:00:16,730
Alright, we'll go damage then.

3825
04:00:19,250 --> 04:00:20,990
God, I stupid fucking hate the ghost.

3826
04:00:21,490 --> 04:00:24,330
The ghost does, like, absolutely nothing for me.

3827
04:00:27,490 --> 04:00:31,330
I feel like if we get the credit card, it'll be so good for us.

3828
04:00:32,330 --> 04:00:33,470
Grab the extra jump.

3829
04:00:36,410 --> 04:00:37,330
Forbidden, Jews.

3830
04:00:37,550 --> 04:00:37,910
Nice.

3831
04:00:39,350 --> 04:00:40,510
It's extra forbidden.

3832
04:00:44,590 --> 04:00:52,430
okay what's that currency time i'm gonna save that i'm gonna save that for this war so i can be rich

3833
04:00:56,820 --> 04:00:57,940

I gotta remember the magnet.

3836
04:02:00,650 --> 04:02:01,070
Banana.

3837
04:02:02,330 --> 04:02:03,030
You know what?

3838
04:02:03,430 --> 04:02:03,850
No.

3839
04:02:05,990 --> 04:02:08,850
I thought about it and the risk is too high.

3840
04:02:10,290 --> 04:02:14,350
But I thought about it and I remember it was not a good time.

3841
04:02:15,190 --> 04:02:16,650
I was like, how bad could it be?

3842
04:02:16,710 --> 04:02:17,810
And I was like, no, it was so bad.

3843
04:02:17,930 --> 04:02:18,570
It was so bad.

3844
04:02:20,650 --> 04:02:24,110
It was like, no, actually it was very bad.

3845
04:02:35,260 --> 04:02:35,340
Yeah.

3846
04:02:37,220 --> 04:02:39,200
I mean, more stuff.

3847
04:02:43,180 --> 04:02:43,940
Bone, banana.

3848
04:02:44,120 --> 04:02:44,800
One, two, or three.

3849
04:02:44,900 --> 04:02:45,860
Do we just... One?

3850
04:02:46,840 --> 04:02:48,400
Oh, you mean the last one?

3851
04:02:49,280 --> 04:02:49,980
We go with cooldown?

3852
04:02:50,800 --> 04:02:53,280
But what if it... No, it was not a good... I remember.

3853
04:02:53,720 --> 04:02:55,600
I thought he had a gun, guys.

3854
04:02:55,960 --> 04:02:56,880
You know what I have?

3855
04:02:56,960 --> 04:02:58,300
I just have bananas.

3856
04:03:01,000 --> 04:03:04,980
He had a fucking gun, and all I had was a banana.

3857
04:03:11,670 --> 04:03:14,490
I feel like Boss Buster would be really good.

3858
04:03:18,010 --> 04:03:22,530
Boss Buster would be really good against the big ones.

3859
04:03:24,090 --> 04:03:24,190
Yeah.

3860
04:03:25,230 --> 04:03:26,910
Because I struggle the most against them.

3861
04:03:27,450 --> 04:03:29,810
We'll have to remember there's a magnet here too.

3862
04:03:33,310 --> 04:03:34,190
Okay, where is he?

3863
04:03:34,370 --> 04:03:35,330
How much damage do I do?

3864
04:03:35,490 --> 04:03:35,950
Thank God.

3865
04:03:38,310 --> 04:03:40,850
Just need more like projectiles or cooldowns.

3866
04:03:40,970 --> 04:03:41,310
See this.

3867
04:03:44,270 --> 04:03:45,310
There you go.

3868
04:03:46,970 --> 04:03:50,630
Dresson and Dean, 30% of their max HP every second.

3869
04:03:50,970 --> 04:03:51,750
Okay, that's good.

3870
04:03:53,870 --> 04:03:54,390
Damage.

3871
04:03:57,730 --> 04:03:59,150
Oh, money, money, money.

3872
04:03:59,490 --> 04:04:00,250
Give me your money.

3873
04:04:01,110 --> 04:04:02,810
Your deficit make me rich.

3874
04:04:03,710 --> 04:04:05,090
That is your purpose.

3875
04:04:07,010 --> 04:04:08,930
Your purpose is to give me money.

3876
04:04:12,610 --> 04:04:14,170
I'm gonna break all the pots.

3877
04:04:17,990 --> 04:04:18,250
Okay.

3878
04:04:20,550 --> 04:04:22,650
Alright, we're gonna grab the magnet after this.

3879
04:04:23,590 --> 04:04:23,830
Alright.

3880
04:04:24,890 --> 04:04:26,270
One, two, or three, chat.

3881
04:04:27,890 --> 04:04:29,070
Capitalism hit monkey.

3882
04:04:29,190 --> 04:04:30,810
What happened to you, monkey?

3883
04:04:35,190 --> 04:04:35,710
Monkey.

3884
04:04:36,330 --> 04:04:40,410
used to be so happy when it's just... Oh, wait, did I grab?

3885
04:04:40,550 --> 04:04:41,390
Oh, okay, I grabbed it.

3886
04:04:41,550 --> 04:04:42,290
Okay, I...

3887
04:04:42,290 --> 04:04:44,750
Used to be so happy when it's just banana.

3888
04:04:45,170 --> 04:04:46,790
What happened to you?

3889
04:04:48,610 --> 04:04:50,470
Capitalism hit monkey hard.

3890
04:04:53,670 --> 04:04:55,810
Monkey, now part of capitalism.

3891
04:05:05,710 --> 04:05:09,070
Oh, I don't know if that's...

3892
04:05:09,070 --> 04:05:10,770
I don't know if this is good.

3893
04:05:12,090 --> 04:05:15,690
I feel like one would be better Yeah, I feel like clacking cheeks would be better.

3894
04:05:15,990 --> 04:05:17,270
It hasn't failed me yet.

3895
04:05:17,990 --> 04:05:19,950
It hasn't failed me yet.

3896
04:05:21,410 --> 04:05:23,730
Oh my god, wait, we need to grab the...

3897
04:05:23,730 --> 04:05:24,490
Can we go here?

3898
04:05:28,450 --> 04:05:29,170
Grab this.

3899
04:05:30,170 --> 04:05:31,330
Okay, because I already have a jump.

3900
04:05:31,690 --> 04:05:33,510
I know I have currency right there.

3901
04:05:33,970 --> 04:05:34,910
I'm grabbing it.

3902
04:05:37,970 --> 04:05:38,850
Where is it?

3903
04:05:40,270 --> 04:05:41,830
It's like, oh, all the way over there.

3904
04:05:41,890 --> 04:05:42,910
No, it's so far.

3905
04:05:44,990 --> 04:05:45,690
Oh, nice.

3906
04:05:45,710 --> 04:05:46,070
reflect.

3907
04:05:47,510 --> 04:05:47,950
Oh, no.

3908
04:05:49,030 --> 04:05:50,010
Okay, we'll grab this too.

3909
04:05:51,570 --> 04:05:53,870
I know I left like the quarantine shit here.

3910
04:05:54,110 --> 04:05:54,250
There you go.

3911
04:05:54,390 --> 04:05:55,830
I see it.

3912
04:05:56,630 --> 04:05:57,570
We'll grab bone.

3913
04:05:58,550 --> 04:05:58,550
Bone.

3914
04:05:59,750 --> 04:06:01,530
This bone is so weak.

3915
04:06:01,930 --> 04:06:02,830
Cool down.

3916
04:06:04,630 --> 04:06:05,110
Bone.

3917
04:06:06,550 --> 04:06:07,410
Bone weak.

3918
04:06:07,670 --> 04:06:09,290
Okay, now damage.

3919
04:06:09,610 --> 04:06:10,610
And then we'll do banana next.

3920
04:06:11,610 --> 04:06:11,930
There you go.

3921
04:06:13,190 --> 04:06:14,530
Wait, did I kill all of them accidentally?

3922
04:06:15,710 --> 04:06:17,090
Hey, where did all the cobblets go?

3923
04:06:17,570 --> 04:06:18,710
I need my money!

3924
04:06:21,270 --> 04:06:23,190
Money can buy more banana!

3925
04:06:30,550 --> 04:06:31,470
Okay, nice.

3926
04:06:33,890 --> 04:06:34,450
Banana.

3927
04:06:36,010 --> 04:06:37,490
Okay, let's go back.

3928
04:06:37,870 --> 04:06:38,930
I'm gonna grab more upgrades.

3929
04:06:41,570 --> 04:06:43,150
But can I afford anything from him?

3930
04:06:44,850 --> 04:06:45,390
Nice.

3931
04:06:45,710 --> 04:06:46,510
Okay, that was nice.

3932
04:06:46,650 --> 04:06:47,730
We got this early.

3933
04:06:48,010 --> 04:06:49,230
That's so good for us.

3934
04:06:50,270 --> 04:06:51,490
That's actually so good for us.

3935
04:06:54,670 --> 04:06:55,150
Bone?

3936
04:06:57,470 --> 04:06:59,490
I can kill these guys fast.

3937
04:07:03,230 --> 04:07:04,370
A forbidden juice.

3938
04:07:06,010 --> 04:07:08,490
If it's so forbidden, why make me so strong?

3939
04:07:11,290 --> 04:07:12,490
Take that, science.

3940
04:07:16,170 --> 04:07:16,690
speed.

3941
04:07:19,990 --> 04:07:21,390
They increase damage.

3942
04:07:22,170 --> 04:07:23,490
I need to be so OP.

3943
04:07:24,190 --> 04:07:25,710
I need the credit card.

3944
04:07:25,930 --> 04:07:27,470
I really need the credit card.

3945
04:07:28,430 --> 04:07:31,890
I think the credit card would be the thing that makes or breaks this run.

3946
04:07:35,050 --> 04:07:36,710
It will go to the...

3947
04:07:40,560 --> 04:07:42,280
Oh my god, is there anything else here?

3948
04:07:42,440 --> 04:07:43,980
That grab area is pretty possible.

3949
04:07:46,220 --> 04:07:48,820
There's so many chests, but I'm so poor.

3950
04:07:49,980 --> 04:07:51,040
I need good credit.

3951
04:07:52,320 --> 04:07:53,720
Monkey needs good credit.

3952
04:07:55,680 --> 04:07:56,880
What to do?

3953
04:07:58,520 --> 04:08:01,540
Won't a bank loan monkey more money?

3954
04:08:13,620 --> 04:08:15,660
Monkey wants to afford home.

3955
04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:19,500
Whoa.

3956
04:08:19,900 --> 04:08:20,900
There's a lot of damage there.

3957
04:08:21,820 --> 04:08:22,160
Monkey.

3958
04:08:22,180 --> 04:08:41,460
needs loan for home so monkey can stockpile banana one or three chat region or size bigger bone and bigger banana monkey wants cards so he doesn't have to jump

3959
04:08:45,620 --> 04:08:52,620
monkey's so tired i will focus on damage to him after do this.

3960
04:08:56,790 --> 04:09:00,970
I think, like, the boss is, like, I can do that in, like, two minutes.

3961
04:09:02,550 --> 04:09:03,950
Uh, increased damage.

3962
04:09:05,670 --> 04:09:06,370
is always good.

3963
04:09:12,370 --> 04:09:13,130
Jump or evasion?

3964
04:09:18,750 --> 04:09:20,950
Monkey needs retirement plan.

3965
04:09:24,800 --> 04:09:25,340
One?

3966
04:09:25,640 --> 04:09:25,860
Alright.

3967
04:09:28,800 --> 04:09:34,620
I think it sucks that I can't, uh, Okay.

3968
04:09:37,160 --> 04:09:37,680
Okay.

3969
04:09:39,400 --> 04:09:40,180
That sucks.

3970
04:09:40,360 --> 04:09:42,220
I actually have not found a single...

3971
04:09:42,880 --> 04:09:45,740
I have not found a single credit card.

3972
04:09:45,940 --> 04:09:46,800
I think it's too late.

3973
04:09:47,800 --> 04:09:50,580
I don't think I'll be finding a credit card anytime soon.

3974
04:09:51,360 --> 04:09:54,200
Banks all reject monkeys attempt to get loan.

3975
04:09:55,000 --> 04:09:55,800
Monkey sad.

3976
04:09:59,160 --> 04:09:59,860
Okay, there's shit.

3979
04:10:03,620 --> 04:10:04,620
Oh, cheese.

3980
04:10:05,060 --> 04:10:05,940
That's always good.

3981
04:10:06,740 --> 04:10:08,660
Alright, I think we can do this now.

3982
04:10:13,100 --> 04:10:13,460
Go down.

3983
04:10:14,380 --> 04:10:15,640
Okay, we need to invest in...

3984
04:10:15,640 --> 04:10:16,280
Cool, never mind.

3985
04:10:16,460 --> 04:10:17,700
I was gonna say, we're gonna...

3986
04:10:17,700 --> 04:10:18,120
Oh, banana.

3987
04:10:20,060 --> 04:10:20,540
Banana?

3988
04:10:22,680 --> 04:10:23,160

3990
04:10:30,430 --> 04:10:32,890

Damage.

3993
04:10:37,010 --> 04:10:39,130
I know we didn't get money here.

3994
04:10:39,750 --> 04:10:40,510
Legendary banana?

3995
04:10:43,350 --> 04:10:45,170
The banks will regret this.

3996
04:10:45,690 --> 04:10:47,430
Now I have legendary banana.

3997
04:10:50,350 --> 04:10:52,710
They will regret messing with monkey.

3998
04:10:55,930 --> 04:10:59,070
Now monkey will be rich with big banana.

3999
04:11:00,070 --> 04:11:01,030
Are you fucking kidding?

4000
04:11:01,030 --> 04:11:01,550

It's fine.

4007
04:11:07,010 --> 04:11:07,910
five chests.

4008
04:11:11,230 --> 04:11:12,070
That's five.

4009
04:11:14,590 --> 04:11:16,890

Oh my god, nice.

That's so good for us.

4015
04:11:25,930 --> 04:11:27,070
That's actually so good.

4016
04:11:28,110 --> 04:11:28,990
Holy shit.

4017
04:11:30,530 --> 04:11:32,370
Oh my god, oh my...

04:11:32,370 --> 04:11:33,730
Okay, we do a lot of damage now.

4019
04:11:34,630 --> 04:11:35,250
Okay, banana.

4020
04:11:37,230 --> 04:11:38,650
Alright, we need to...

4021
04:11:38,650 --> 04:11:40,370
Okay, I'm gonna try and, like, I need to upgrade bone.

4022
04:11:40,750 --> 04:11:42,410
I feel like I should upgrade bone now.

4023
04:11:44,990 --> 04:11:46,950
Okay, so final swarm incoming.

4024
04:11:47,650 --> 04:11:49,190
Oh my god, there's, like, stuff here.

4025
04:11:49,830 --> 04:11:50,970
I have to...

4026
04:11:50,970 --> 04:11:52,110
Oh my god, another credit card.

4027
04:11:52,670 --> 04:11:53,650
More damage, then.

4028
04:11:54,310 --> 04:11:55,450
There's, like, something...

4029
04:11:55,450 --> 04:11:56,730
Oh my god, it's a shady man.

4030
04:11:56,930 --> 04:11:57,690
Fuck, I'm broke.

4031
04:12:00,670 --> 04:12:01,730
Oh, wait, that's actually good.

4032
04:12:02,270 --> 04:12:02,830
More damage.

4033
04:12:04,590 --> 04:12:06,730
Okay, I can farm a little bit here.

4034
04:12:08,130 --> 04:12:10,870
Just a little bit, but I gotta get close to the exit.

4035
04:12:11,990 --> 04:12:12,370
Damage.

4036
04:12:15,890 --> 04:12:16,370
Okay.

4037
04:12:17,530 --> 04:12:21,630
I could stay here and farm just a little bit before they decided to fuck me up.

4038
04:12:22,210 --> 04:12:23,090
Just a little bit.

4039
04:12:23,950 --> 04:12:24,730
I can grab him.

4040
04:12:24,810 --> 04:12:25,670
Let's grab this too.

4041
04:12:27,550 --> 04:12:27,810
Okay.

4042
04:12:27,930 --> 04:12:32,410
I think it's like a minute before the big boys, the scarier boys come in.

4043
04:12:34,130 --> 04:12:34,330
Alright.

4044
04:12:34,490 --> 04:12:36,470
Next upgrade we'll focus on bone.

4045
04:12:37,010 --> 04:12:38,190
Oh, my God.

4046
04:12:38,530 --> 04:12:39,070
Oh, my God.

4047
04:12:39,190 --> 04:12:39,950
Oh, my God.

4048
04:12:40,150 --> 04:12:40,750
They're all coming.

4049
04:12:40,910 --> 04:12:41,630
They're all coming.

4050
04:12:41,750 --> 04:12:44,030
I'm gonna put the shield on just in case.

4051
04:12:44,530 --> 04:12:44,830
Whoa.

4052
04:12:46,690 --> 04:12:47,290

My people need me.

4058
04:12:59,510 --> 04:13:01,470
These are my GMO bananas.

4059
04:13:02,870 --> 04:13:08,090
I really need to upgrade my, uh, I need to, upgrade my bones, though.

4060
04:13:08,530 --> 04:13:10,050
I think bones need the most upgrades.

4061
04:13:14,790 --> 04:13:15,450
Luck or size?

4062
04:13:16,450 --> 04:13:17,670

04:13:18,410 --> 04:13:19,730

04:13:20,530 --> 04:13:21,710
Up on night to get lucky.

If I see another movement speed, I'll get it.

4132
04:19:02,680 --> 04:19:03,580

Okay, we need $2,000.

4137
04:19:13,040 --> 04:19:14,000
Okay, there's chest here.

4138
04:19:15,380 --> 04:19:16,760
Oh my god, there's a gold chest.

4139
04:19:18,860 --> 04:19:20,140
Okay, it's movement speed.

4140
04:19:20,880 --> 04:19:21,620
Oh my god, okay.

4141
04:19:22,680 --> 04:19:25,060
I need to find a magnet so badly.

4142
04:19:26,960 --> 04:19:27,380
Cheese.

4143
04:19:29,320 --> 04:19:29,540

4144
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:34,260
Are there zero magnets here?

4145
04:19:35,440 --> 04:19:36,000
Okay.

4146
04:19:36,020 --> 04:19:37,080

04:19:41,100 --> 04:19:41,560
Streamer privilege.

4149
04:19:42,120 --> 04:19:42,820
Streamer privilege.

4150
04:19:43,340 --> 04:19:44,140

4151
04:19:44,440 --> 04:19:45,420

4153
04:19:51,660 --> 04:19:52,740
Streamer privilege.

4154
04:19:56,330 --> 04:19:58,840
I love streamer privilege.

4155
04:20:04,660 --> 04:20:05,960
Death's in the...

4156
04:20:06,020 --> 04:20:12,020

Okay.

4159
04:20:42,580 --> 04:20:44,280
This time, this time.

4160
04:20:44,540 --> 04:20:46,220
I'm so weak, though.

4161
04:20:47,700 --> 04:20:50,160
I'm, like, so, like, unhealthy.

4162
04:20:50,560 --> 04:20:52,220
That's the only issue.

4163
04:20:53,000 --> 04:20:54,340
I'm so...

4164
04:20:54,340 --> 04:20:57,400
I'm so not healthy right now.

4165
04:20:57,840 --> 04:20:59,700
I do a lot of damage.

4166
04:20:59,780 --> 04:21:00,500
I will agree.

4167
04:21:00,640 --> 04:21:02,580
I do a lot of damage.

4168
04:21:03,100 --> 04:21:07,100
But he does one damage to me, And I fucking will pass out.

4169
04:21:07,180 --> 04:21:07,560
I will.

4170
04:21:08,700 --> 04:21:10,260
Speaking of passing out.

4171
04:21:11,380 --> 04:21:11,960
Shit.

4172
04:21:13,380 --> 04:21:14,440
I told you.

4173
04:21:14,800 --> 04:21:15,440
He does.

4174
04:21:15,660 --> 04:21:16,980
He touches me once.

4175
04:21:17,520 --> 04:21:18,140
It's over.

4176
04:21:18,660 --> 04:21:19,980
It's actually over.

4177
04:21:20,180 --> 04:21:20,980
If he touched me.

4178
04:21:23,240 --> 04:21:25,260
That's what I'm most scared about.

4179
04:21:25,580 --> 04:21:26,140
Oh no.

4180
04:21:26,260 --> 04:21:27,260
Not the fucking.

4181
04:21:27,720 --> 04:21:28,060
Really?

4182
04:21:28,480 --> 04:21:28,940
Really?

4183
04:21:29,440 --> 04:21:29,920
Okay.

4184
04:21:30,080 --> 04:21:31,540
This is a bit bad though.

4185
04:21:31,780 --> 04:21:32,820
The swarm is coming.

4186
04:21:33,080 --> 04:21:34,980
And I'm a little scared.

4187
04:21:35,260 --> 04:21:38,600
Because I do not have a lot of life steal.

4188
04:21:39,500 --> 04:21:40,740
I have to run.

4189
04:21:43,080 --> 04:21:46,020
I don't have a lot of life steal, so I'm very scared.

4190
04:21:47,700 --> 04:21:48,720
Okay, nice.

4191
04:21:51,480 --> 04:21:53,260
Oh my god, as long as I...

4192
04:21:54,460 --> 04:21:55,520
Oh my god.

4193
04:21:55,800 --> 04:21:56,780
I jump.

4194
04:21:57,760 --> 04:21:58,500
I jump.

4195
04:21:58,960 --> 04:21:59,560
Oh, he's dead.

4196
04:21:59,700 --> 04:22:00,060
He's dead.

4197
04:22:00,600 --> 04:22:01,640
Oh, he's fucking dead.

4198
04:22:03,260 --> 04:22:03,740
Banana.

4199
04:22:06,700 --> 04:22:07,080
Uh...

4200
04:22:07,080 --> 04:22:07,760
Damage.

4201
04:22:09,440 --> 04:22:10,400
Oh, thank god.

4202
04:22:11,900 --> 04:22:12,280
Okay.

4203
04:22:15,300 --> 04:22:17,080
Yeah, I have to go to the portal.

4204
04:22:17,280 --> 04:22:17,980
Oh, I have to go to the portal.

4205
04:22:18,060 --> 04:22:18,820
I have to go to the portal.

4206
04:22:19,000 --> 04:22:19,620
I have to go to the portal.

4207
04:22:19,960 --> 04:22:21,360
I have to go to the portal.

4208
04:22:22,480 --> 04:22:23,300
Where's the portal?

4209
04:22:24,020 --> 04:22:24,820
Where is it?

4210
04:22:25,120 --> 04:22:25,760
Oh, wait, bud.

4211
04:22:26,000 --> 04:22:26,540
Oh, wait, chest.

4212
04:22:27,820 --> 04:22:28,160
Okay.

4213
04:22:32,230 --> 04:22:32,990
Alright, nice.

4214
04:22:33,730 --> 04:23:09,630

4216
04:23:09,970 --> 04:23:10,150
Okay.

4217
04:23:10,710 --> 04:23:12,170
Attack speed, life steal, and bone.

4218
04:23:12,470 --> 04:23:12,730
All right.

4219
04:23:13,150 --> 04:23:13,750
That's fine.

4220
04:23:16,810 --> 04:23:17,330
Okay.

4221
04:23:17,950 --> 04:23:18,770
All right, we leave.

4222
04:23:19,390 --> 04:23:20,050
We leave.

4223
04:23:20,130 --> 04:23:21,450
I tested my luck enough.

4224
04:23:22,650 --> 04:23:23,410
Life steal and bone.

4225
04:23:23,870 --> 04:23:24,930
Oh, this is scary.

4226
04:23:25,810 --> 04:23:27,350
This seems like a...

4227
04:23:27,350 --> 04:23:30,490
This does not seem like a place that monkeys should be in.

4228
04:23:36,590 --> 04:23:37,110
This...

4229
04:23:37,690 --> 04:23:38,210
Um...

4230
04:23:38,290 --> 04:23:40,990
I don't think monkey is supposed to be here.

4231
04:23:41,950 --> 04:23:42,950
Uh-oh.

4232
04:23:49,250 --> 04:23:51,730
I need an extra jump.

4233
04:23:51,790 --> 04:23:54,190
I think, like, the jump has been helping me a lot.

4234
04:23:58,350 --> 04:23:59,210
I could grab armor.

4235
04:23:59,970 --> 04:24:01,610
Alright, next time I see armor, I'll grab it.

4236
04:24:05,910 --> 04:24:06,350
Okay.

4237
04:24:09,170 --> 04:24:10,870
Nah, three jumps.

4238
04:24:11,010 --> 04:24:11,350
Yay!

4239
04:24:16,610 --> 04:24:17,810
Monkeys now in doom.

4240
04:24:18,490 --> 04:24:18,630
Yeah.

4241
04:24:19,190 --> 04:24:20,630
We're in doom now.

4242
04:24:23,090 --> 04:24:23,470
Life steal.

4243
04:24:23,810 --> 04:24:24,590
Okay, that's what we need.

4244
04:24:25,550 --> 04:24:26,530
Holy fuck, thank god.

4245
04:24:31,880 --> 04:24:32,260
Alright.

4246
04:24:32,760 --> 04:24:33,620
Gotta grab this.

4247
04:24:34,620 --> 04:24:36,720
Oh, we have to grab as many upgrades as possible.

4248
04:24:41,400 --> 04:24:42,500
I'll try.

4249
04:24:44,040 --> 04:24:44,540
Oh.

4250
04:24:44,760 --> 04:24:45,660
Two or three.

4251
04:24:47,960 --> 04:24:48,560
Three?

4252
04:24:49,520 --> 04:24:52,720
Should we grab three?

4253
04:24:57,080 --> 04:24:59,460
I need to kill these guys for chest.

4254
04:25:00,760 --> 04:25:02,240
Chest is always good.

4255
04:25:03,880 --> 04:25:06,040
Holy shit, they're so tanky.

4256
04:25:07,820 --> 04:25:09,340
All right, more gold.

4257
04:25:12,920 --> 04:25:14,440
Okay, I'm gonna save that magnet.

4258
04:25:15,100 --> 04:25:16,340

That does not bring me joy.

4271
04:26:35,910 --> 04:26:37,350
That absolutely does not bring me joy.

4272
04:26:37,890 --> 04:26:38,830
Get him away from me.

4273
04:26:40,950 --> 04:26:42,310

He's dead.

4282
04:26:52,110 --> 04:26:53,030
He can't hurt me no more.

Oh, this sucks.

4310
04:28:47,830 --> 04:28:49,310
This sucks because there's so much.

4311
04:28:49,650 --> 04:28:52,310
I know I left so many power-ups, too.

4312
04:29:03,070 --> 04:29:04,090
Oh, this sucks.

4313
04:29:04,490 --> 04:29:05,810
This sucks.

4314
04:29:07,250 --> 04:29:09,590
I don't know what I'm looking at.

4315
04:29:16,260 --> 04:29:17,100
I am.

4316
04:29:17,300 --> 04:29:18,620
I'm looking at my map.

4317
04:29:19,640 --> 04:29:20,880
I see no magnet.

4318
04:29:21,100 --> 04:29:22,120
I just see health.

4319
04:29:23,780 --> 04:29:24,720
Okay, it's boss time.

4320
04:29:24,780 --> 04:29:26,300
I have to field the boss, though.

4321
04:29:27,360 --> 04:29:28,660
Oh, this is so bad.

4322
04:29:29,520 --> 04:29:30,740
Oh my god, this is so bad.

4323
04:29:32,420 --> 04:29:33,740
Okay, back in.

4324
04:29:35,840 --> 04:29:36,240
Nice!

4325
04:29:37,840 --> 04:29:39,440
Okay, that's good, that's good, that's good.

4326
04:29:40,000 --> 04:29:40,740
Wait, that's not so good.

4327
04:29:41,300 --> 04:29:41,620
Damage.

4328
04:29:44,760 --> 04:29:46,840
Oh my god, I can't see anything.

4329
04:29:49,800 --> 04:29:51,260
Wait, I can almost afford this.

4330
04:29:51,900 --> 04:29:53,980
No, no, he cannot do this to me.

4331
04:29:56,680 --> 04:29:57,080
Okay.

4332
04:29:57,680 --> 04:30:00,240
No, he cannot fucking do this to me.

4333
04:30:00,700 --> 04:30:01,800
Why did you have this?

4334
04:30:01,900 --> 04:30:03,100
Oh my god, okay, I have to summon him.

4335
04:30:03,200 --> 04:30:03,580
I don't care.

4336
04:30:04,080 --> 04:30:05,200
I have to summon him.

4337
04:30:05,560 --> 04:30:07,100
Okay, this is...

4338
04:30:09,500 --> 04:30:10,520
Where am I?

4339
04:30:12,940 --> 04:30:13,820
Oh, shit.

4340
04:30:14,800 --> 04:30:17,280
Oh, I didn't realize I've been in a whole new world.

4341
04:30:17,700 --> 04:30:18,980
Oh, fuck, okay.

4342
04:30:19,460 --> 04:30:20,700
Okay, I didn't know.

4343
04:30:21,040 --> 04:30:23,200
7.8 million.

4344
04:30:25,740 --> 04:30:27,040
What do you mean?

4345
04:30:37,810 --> 04:30:39,270
Where's my banana?

4346
04:30:54,450 --> 04:30:56,130
Guys, hey, look.

4347
04:30:56,730 --> 04:30:58,610
39,000 in the work.

4348
04:30:58,910 --> 04:30:59,070
Okay.

4349
04:31:00,110 --> 04:31:02,890
We got, we, technically we beat tier three.

4350
04:31:03,910 --> 04:31:05,050
We got transported.

4351
04:31:05,410 --> 04:31:06,230
I take those.

4352
04:31:06,710 --> 04:31:07,510
I'm not, I'm not.

4353
04:31:08,350 --> 04:31:11,670
I don't know.

4354
04:31:12,230 --> 04:31:14,350
I don't even know what happened.

4355
04:31:16,390 --> 04:31:21,070
It just transported me and then I was gone.

4356
04:31:21,230 --> 04:31:22,770
I was just gone.

4357
04:31:25,390 --> 04:31:28,390
I don't know what happened to me, guys.

4358
04:31:28,930 --> 04:31:30,330
What the fuck happened?

4359
04:31:32,190 --> 04:31:34,250
Alright, let's just...

4360
04:31:35,790 --> 04:31:37,690
Maybe him skill issue?

4361
04:31:41,090 --> 04:31:42,150
I'll take it.

4362
04:31:42,230 --> 04:31:42,870
Fuck it.

4363
04:31:43,170 --> 04:31:44,130
That's fine.

4364
04:31:44,270 --> 04:31:44,710
Let me...

4365
04:31:44,710 --> 04:31:46,010
I'm gonna spend...

4366
04:31:46,250 --> 04:31:47,470
That was a good attempt.

4367
04:31:47,510 --> 04:31:48,430
That was fun.

4368
04:31:49,130 --> 04:31:52,510
Honestly, I had a lot of fun playing this.

4369
04:31:52,650 --> 04:31:56,090
Yeah, he sneezed on me and I was just dead.

4370
04:31:56,530 --> 04:31:59,410
I don't think there was anything else I could do.

4371
04:31:59,810 --> 04:32:03,770
He literally just, he just was like, achoo, and then I died.

4372
04:32:03,970 --> 04:32:05,630
Like, I died.

4373
04:32:05,950 --> 04:32:12,030
I mean, but, yeah, it was very addicting.

4374
04:32:12,930 --> 04:32:13,910
A lot of things in the super chat.

4375
04:32:13,950 --> 04:32:14,570
Thank you, thank you.

4376
04:32:14,610 --> 04:32:16,030
Monkey made a banana.

4377
04:32:16,250 --> 04:33:12,090
rip up like oh my god yeah honestly this is very addicting i can see now why a lot of people are spent are like investing like so many hours on it like right off the bat and uh and i didn't unlock a lot see like i barely unlocked half the roster too um and like there's a second map see like look there's i don't know how many maps are there but like there's like three tiers and there's a second map too um so i feel like i've just i'm at the just like um like i just did like 10 of the content uh of this stream um but it's definitely very fun i really i'm not sponsored by them i really but i had so much fun um yeah i feel like i just scratched the surface on this for this game and uh i feel like you could do there's so much to do wait oh my god could be blue monkey but i'm poor honestly i think like default monkey is the best monkey Honestly,

4378
04:33:12,550 --> 04:33:13,690
I think Monkey is the strongest.

4379
04:33:14,310 --> 04:33:23,290
I think, like, I read the reviews and people were saying, like, if you run speed build on calcium, like, like, you're unstoppable.

4380
04:33:23,590 --> 04:33:24,430
You're just too fast.

4381
04:33:26,070 --> 04:33:34,630
But right now, from all the characters I unlocked, apparently this guy is the meta, but all the characters unlocked, Monkey seems the strongest for me.

4382
04:33:35,030 --> 04:33:36,870
But I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

4383
04:33:37,270 --> 04:33:40,770
I know how long we, I didn't intend to, I never expected to stream this long.

4384
04:33:40,770 --> 04:33:43,990
I just got, I didn't think I get this addicted, but it's very addicting.

4385
04:33:44,890 --> 04:33:52,450
It's very addicting, and I think aura, no, aura, okay, he might have aura, but he was the hardest to play.

4386
04:33:53,310 --> 04:33:59,730
Because I, unless I have a speed build, I think, like, like, I felt like I was not doing enough damage.

4387
04:33:59,990 --> 04:34:01,910
I felt like my damage was so shit.

4388
04:34:07,530 --> 04:34:10,630
Anyway, guys, I hope y'all have fun watching.

4389
04:34:10,770 --> 04:34:36,630
