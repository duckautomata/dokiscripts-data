1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
With Watson pylons and then like caustic traps stacked on there.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,720
Okay, it's okay.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,580
Jen won yesterday's Twitch Rivals.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,020
I got 19th place.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,280
Ill average out.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,940
And don't worry!

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,400
Ill average out!

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,520
I was on- look, I was on the fuck- I was on Wig's team, okay?

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,460
Like...

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,340
Oh, Tempo- what was Tempo doing?

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,820
He was charging the whole time, wasn't he?

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,640
We were- we were all of us.

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,700
We were all not- not gonna make it.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,500
We're not- It's gonna average out!

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,100
We can average our rankings out from here.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,200
Oh my god.

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,320
So it's looking like a ninth place or what?

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,900
What's the average for that?

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,000
It's okay.

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,640
Apparently like only placements matter.

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,340
So we don't have to get any kills.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,160
We just gotta be first to win money.

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,600
No, we got this.

26
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,220
We got this.

27
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,500
Yeah.

28
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,220
Oh, the odds are gonna be up by the way?

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Yeah, the code's up.

30
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,480
The code's up.

31
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm in it.

32
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:04,820
It's alright.

33
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,600
We got this.

34
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,620
We have Gen.

35
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,520
He won last Twitch Rivals.

36
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,860
He practically has the winning streak right now.

37
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,040
Exactly.

38
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,500
Yeah.

39
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,800
So I won Pro League and I won Twitch Rivals.

40
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,580
Exactly!

41
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,700
If you lose this game, all your cheapness never mattered.

42
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,380
If you lose this tournament, Gen, then that means the other wins, they were luck.

43
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,720
They were lucky.

44
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,460
They were lucky.

45
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,720
This is where real skill matters now.

46
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,260
Punching and shit?

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,000
Like a man.

48
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,420
Yeah.

49
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,840
No weapons is real skill.

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,580
It's all about your brain at that point.

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
It's here to test your brain.

52
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:45,640
I have no brain.

53
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:45,640
I'm a controller.

54
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh shit.

55
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,200
You're fucking right.

56
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,500
Oh dang.

57
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,160
Wait, do you have aim assist on punch?

58
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,620
No, no.

59
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,740
Wait, he does.

60
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,040
Wait, does he do?

61
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,940
Did he take that out?

62
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,220
No.

63
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,720
What?

64
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,300
He got rid of it.

65
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah, they got rid of aim assist on punch.

66
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,520
They got rid of it.

67
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,880
Why?

68
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,840
It used to be in the game.

69
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,780
It used to be in the game.

70
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,720
Yeah, it was.

71
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,300
It used to be.

72
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Aim assist on punching.

73
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,460
Why?

74
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,980
Controller players should have everything they want.

75
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,160
That's so true.

76
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,920
Yeah, might as well.

77
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,040
Give them everything.

78
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,020
Might as well.

79
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,140
They're basically keeping the game alive at the moment.

80
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,620
Wait, I can't find the code.

81
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,240
Where is it?

82
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,760
It's in the... It's in the code section.

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,780
It literally says code.

84
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,800
It has a PC icon or laptop icon.

85
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,820
Oh, I see.

86
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,440
Thank you.

87
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,940
Yeah, first game.

88
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,700
What are we playing?

89
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,340
We're playing Fuse?

90
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,600
Caustic Watson.

91
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,260
Fuse Caustic Watson?

92
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,220
Yeah.

93
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,800
Okay.

94
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,540
I can do Watson.

95
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll just put fences.

96
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,880
I'll be the fences girl.

97
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,300
I can do anyone but Fuse because I don't play him.

98
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,880
I don't have him unlocked because I hate him.

99
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,420
Not gonna lie.

100
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,140
Wait, you don't have him?

101
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,500
How many tokens do you have?

102
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,340
I do, but I played maybe like two games on Caustic realistically.

103
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,120
Wait, but just... you must have a million... I have a million Legend tokens.

104
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,040
You must have the tokens to unlock.

105
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Oh, I do.

106
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,800
I don't do outspite.

107
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
I don't unlock them outspite.

108
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,920
Oh, so you don't like money.

109
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,180
Wait, wait, wait.

110
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,380
Spoons.

111
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:20,780
Hold up.

112
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,020
Spoons.

113
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,260
No, no, no.

114
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,860
Listen, listen.

115
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,340
So you don't like money?

116
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,580
I will call out Fuse if that's what it takes.

117
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,080
I'll do it.

118
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,540
I'll do it.

119
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,460
No, no, no.

120
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:26,640
Wait, wait.

121
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,180
Spoons.

122
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,420
Is it because he's Aussie?

123
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,840
Is this...

124
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,480
Oh, is it because he's Australian?

125
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,060
Do you hate Australians?

126
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,000
He is Aussie, yeah.

127
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm Australian too.

128
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,760
Nah, I took offence, cuz.

129
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,640
Ain't no way.

130
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,220
Do it.

131
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,140
Call her that way.

132
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,320
You have the pass.

133
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,880
Does that mean you have the pass?

134
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,320
Does that mean you have the pass?

135
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,000
Wait, but like... wait, he's like unlocked, right?

136
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,780
No.

137
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,760
Yeah, Fuse is... no, it's Mad Maggie.

138
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,560
Mad Maggie is unlocked this week.

139
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,220
Is everyone... are you... wait, we're waiting for someone.

140
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
Can I like unlock him really quick?

141
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,180
No, there's... you're fine.

143
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
There's like two people that's not here.

144
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,500
Okay.

145
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm just gonna say, straight back, really quick.

146
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,680
Oh my god, I can't believe I'm... wait, he's in rotation though, I think.

147
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,420
No, it's nice.

148
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,140
Like, grenades are allowed, right?

149
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,320
Yeah, grenades are allowed.

150
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,220
I'll just unlock and be safe.

151
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,540
Okay.

152
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,920
This hurts.

153
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm gonna carry an inventory full of grenades.

154
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,080
Yeah, yeah.

155
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,660
It's gonna be... if we get to endgame, we're set.

156
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,180
We're set.

157
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,560
All the fences, all the nades.

158
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,040
We don't need the grenades early, by the way.

159
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,020
Unless we're gonna kill someone.

160
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,040
Yeah, yeah.

161
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
Yeah, unless you're gonna get that stuck.

162
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,480
Okay.

163
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Just get that stuck... that grenade stuck and you'll be fine.

164
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,680
This is literally my first time playing Fuse.

165
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,840
But it's okay, I'm really good at sticking Arcstars.

166
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,240
Okay, wait.

167
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,800
Do you wanna play... okay, I'll play Fuse, then you play Caustic.

168
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,500
No, no, no.

169
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,900
I think it's better if we have...

170
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,600
I think it's better if we have a good Caustic.

171
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Cause Fuse, you're just kinda spammy.

172
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm not a good Caustic, though.

173
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Okay, but is he a good Caustic?

174
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm gonna say like...

175
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm the best.

176
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,960
I don't think I've ever seen him play Caustic willingly.

177
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,260
I'm the best.

178
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,980
Has he ever played Fuse... like, Caustic willingly?

179
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,100
He's a controller player.

180
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,740
I feel like you don't know much about Fuse.

181
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,300
Hey, I won a championship with Caustic.

182
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,840
I'm just saying.

183
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,940
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,200
That's why you're playing Caustic.

185
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm just saying.

186
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,120
Well, like, Fuse is OP.

187
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,240
You can stick people and shit.

188
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,260
Like, it's fun.

189
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,880
Oh, so then you don't wanna win if you... why would you do that?

190
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Justify... yeah.

191
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,460
I'll play Caustic.

192
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Fuse is the Clutch character.

193
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,120
All good.

194
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,920
We have plenty of time.

195
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,820
I think.

196
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,380
We were supposed to start like seven minutes ago, but Apex stuff never starts in time, so we're good to go.

197
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

198
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,060
We're good to go.

199
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,570
I just realized... okay.

200
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,730
Look at Team 1.

201
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,950
Please look at Team 1.

202
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,710
I wasn't gonna say that.

203
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,890
And Team 6 and Team 4.

204
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,210
Then Team 2.

205
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,210
How are these fair?

206
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:53,610
They're okay.

207
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,770
Because they're not using guns.

208
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,330
What the fuck do you mean?

209
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,190
Half of those players are controller players.

210
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,290
They don't have brains.

211
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,890
So what?

212
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,290
They don't have brains.

213
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,230
It's literally melee.

214
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,190
What are they gonna do?

215
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,030
Punch you better?

216
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:08,970
Yes.

217
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,990
Or coordinate punches better or something, I don't know.

218
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,310
Oh, yeah, when you become a pro player, you have to punch people better.

219
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,250
They add 10 plus more damage if you get into pro league.

220
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:20,830
Is that it?

221
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,210
For each?

222
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,630
Yeah, it's like a beach legend.

223
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,490
But imagine we survive to end zone, like Caustic ult, easy win.

224
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,950
Exactly, unless my Watson ult eats it.

225
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,590
That is true.

226
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,290
I think we can assume that every team will have a Caustic and Watson.

227
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,730
It's okay.

228
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,490
100%.

229
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,270
It's okay.

230
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,670
There's probably going to be one team with like a Crypto.

231
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,890
We have... yeah, I feel so.

232
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,130
Yeah, there has to be.

233
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,770
But it's okay.

234
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,530
I can put fences again.

235
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,610
They can Crypto ult me once, but I have infinite fences.

237
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,890
Well, we'll slap the ult ourselves too.

238
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,650
You're not real.

239
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,450
They're going to start punching the generator.

240
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,430
Not if you start punching the generator.

241
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,350
You punched them away from the gen.

242
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,490
We play protect the president.

243
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,270
The generator is our president.

244
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,450
It really is.

245
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,250
Wait, get the generator, the two generators.

246
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,110
Oh shit, you're right.

247
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:14,750
The two generator.

248
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,070
You're right.

249
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,270
They can't kill all the gens.

250
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,470
So what we do at the start of the game, we go run around.

251
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,530
And we just farm.

252
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,210
And we just farm fucking armor.

253
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,630
Oh my god, wait, you're right.

254
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,310
And then we go to zone.

255
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:22,750
Alright?

256
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,790
You're right, you're right.

257
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,290
You're thinking.

258
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,970
You're actually using your brain for real.

259
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,430
Hey, what brain?

260
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,570
Just tap into Zero's brain right now.

261
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,550
I'm tapping into it.

262
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,230
He's going to get rolled.

263
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,990
Dang.

264
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,050
He's nervous.

265
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,370
He's so nervous.

266
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,670
He's going to be so scared.

267
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,490
If you beat Zero, you can become IGL.

268
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,290
Really?

269
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,010
Yeah, that's the rules.

270
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:49,630
If you beat Zero, you can become IGL.

271
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,390
If you perform better than your IGL, you become the new IGL.

272
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,850
In a troll tournament though?

273
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,010
Yeah.

274
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,990
Are you serious?

275
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,550
How dare you?

276
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,970
This is a real tournament.

277
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,290
This has more money involved than Twitch Rivals.

278
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,310
What?

279
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,530
Twitch Rivals had...

280
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,890
How much was it?

281
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,110
I don't know.

282
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,550
This has more money involved than Twitch Rivals.

283
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,330
How dare you?

284
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:05,990
Is it actually?

285
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:06,890
Yeah.

286
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,070
This is a hundred...

287
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,130
Oh my god.

288
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,510
A hundred K?

289
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,170
Yeah, it's a hundred K prize pool.

290
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,630
But put that into Twitch Rivals, man.

291
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,630
I deserve that.

292
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,510
Yeah.

293
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,730
I won the game.

294
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,150
This is the one that matters.

295
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,210
This is the one that matters.

296
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,370
You're right.

297
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,610
One game matters.

298
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,770
One game of this is half your prize winning from Twitch Rivals.

299
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,310
Oh my god.

300
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,030
Don't you dare tell me this is a troll tournament.

301
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,290
Now you're going to do it again today.

302
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,690
Just for this match though.

303
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,750
I need to say...

304
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,510
Just for this game.

305
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,170
Just for this game.

306
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,510
And then you can like tone it down.

307
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,310
No, or he could win every game.

308
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,970
Oh wait, no, he's going to be not on our...

309
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,630
He's not going to be on my team.

310
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,510
So just this game.

311
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,910
You can win this game and then fuck off the next other games.

312
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,250
Yeah.

313
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:48,850
Yeah.

314
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,230
Wait, is it?

315
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:49,590
Wait, what?

316
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,750
Do we like change teammates every time?

317
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,670
Yeah, every game is a different team.

318
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,370
Oh, yalla bye.

319
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,970
Yeah.

320
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,430
This is the one that matters.

321
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,730
So if you win you get 1k.

322
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,730
Yeah, we win and we get 1k.

323
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,210
Exactly.

324
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,530
And we already... do we get like that $500 entry free?

325
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,210
I think we do, right?

326
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,670
Yeah.

327
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,250
Yeah, I think so.

328
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,550
But when you make it to finals, you also get a free $500.

329
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,290
Oh fuck yeah.

330
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:13,950
Yeah.

331
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,590
Yeah.

332
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,310
So if we win this, that actually is half the Twitch Rivals winning.

333
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,590
Yeah.

334
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,490
And if you come 11th to 20th, you still get a hundred bucks.

335
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:22,810
Yeah.

336
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,410
You still get...

337
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:23,530
Yeah.

338
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,090
Well, this is a free money farm.

339
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:26,990
Exactly.

340
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,950
So it's not troll.

341
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,530
This is better than pro league.

342
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,950
This is better than pro league.

343
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,010
This is serious.

344
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,370
How did this tournament is better than pro league?

345
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,270
Cause it's the finals.

346
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,770
You don't understand.

347
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,770
We worked so hard to get here.

348
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,790
I worked so hard to get here.

349
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,110
So how do you go for this?

350
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,570
So you see if you get like kill leader in GDMs or you have to get... win a game in BL?

351
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:49,590
Yeah.

352
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,510
You have to either win a game or become kill leader.

353
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,490
I mean that's easy.

354
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:55,850
Yeah.

355
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,950
That should be easy.

356
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,850
For you that's really easy right?

357
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,650
That's so easy.

358
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,050
Yeah.

359
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,610
I got this.

360
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,730
My... me and my two bronze badge... two bronze and plat badge.

361
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,830
I got this.

362
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,910
We'll be fine.

363
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,570
Wait, where are we dropping?

364
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,010
We haven't even discussed our drops.

365
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,870
Where are we landing?

366
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,530
Oh, was it...

367
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:19,590
Oh, it was...

368
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,430
We're going to Overlook I think I saw earlier.

369
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,970
Are we going to Overlook?

370
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,550
I think so.

371
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,670
Wait, do we clean a spot?

372
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,110
I'm pretty sure that's what I saw Jen put but I could also be wrong.

373
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,030
Um... yeah yeah, Overlook I think.

374
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,710
I don't know if we're contested though.

375
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,210
Is it...

376
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:38,690
It's fine.

377
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,350
We're gonna get a dude to punch us out.

378
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,430
Right.

379
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,790
Oh no, we get it by ourselves.

380
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,850
We'll be fine.

381
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,910
There's no way.

382
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,570
There's no way they get us out.

383
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:49,650
We're gonna get...

384
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,390
I'll contest it.

385
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,810
Yeah.

386
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,870
How do you talk that much?

387
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,130
You talk more than me.

388
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,230
How's that possible?

389
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,930
How's that possible?

390
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,770
It's called being a fucking professional Vtuber.

391
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:03,970
That's how.

392
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:04,570
Jesus man.

393
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,230
I don't think I can sign up for five seconds, you know?

394
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,650
It's because when you don't have aim, you have to compensate it with other stuff to make people watch you.

395
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,710
Jesus.

396
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,470
You're a professional, yeah, bro.

397
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,590
You got a degree in Michigan or what?

399
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,950
They're not here to watch me for my aim.

400
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,710
They're here to watch me for relatability.

401
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,150
For the vibes.

402
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,930
Yeah, for the vibes and the relatability.

403
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,090
Because if I can make it in this tournament, anybody can in your chat.

404
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,950
You hear that chat?

405
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,130
Why you guys not in here?

406
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:37,950
You guys suck.

407
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,430
That's right.

408
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,070
No, no, no.

409
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,310
That means you have a chance.

410
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,570
My aim might not be as good as Shen, but I can win as more money than him, maybe.

411
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:47,770
You're kidding me.

412
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,910
If I out-earned Gen in this tournament, in this tournament, that means you can, too.

413
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,830
So prior to this, I had $500 earning in this tournament.

414
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,790
Yeah, $500.

415
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,030
All of us do.

416
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,090
All of us?

417
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,890
Okay, okay.

418
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,170
I'm as equal to Gen right now.

419
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,610
My prize winnings is as equal to Gen.

420
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,170
It'll be fine.

421
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,170
You know Horizon Doki?

422
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:17,590
Oh, yeah.

423
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,670
It was really fun.

424
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,650
Horizon, yeah?

425
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:19,510
The British kid.

426
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,850
Yeah, you talk more than him.

427
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:21,770
I talk more than...

428
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,190
Isn't he the Spider-Man kid?

429
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,030
Yeah, the Spider-Man kid.

430
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,110
Oh, that sounds like Tom Holland?

431
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,330
Yeah, Tom Holland.

432
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,030
Tom Holland, yeah.

433
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,910
It's a good thing.

434
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,090
Yeah, that's good.

435
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,030
That means he's entertaining.

436
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,070
It is.

437
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,930
Yeah, he already has a friend.

438
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,270
Finally!

439
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,430
He's Tom Holland at Walmart.

440
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,230
Walmart Tom Holland.

441
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,410
Well, actually no.

442
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,510
Tom Holland at Wish.

443
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,830
That seems more like it.

444
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,890
Nah, I'm gonna tell him about that.

445
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,310
Yeah.

446
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,190
He's gonna start crying.

447
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,510
He's gonna stay...

448
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,110
Are we landing again?

449
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,470
Overlook?

450
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,530
Yeah, we're at Overlook.

451
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,510
Oh yeah, good.

452
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,090
We can just start farming armors from them.

453
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,610
Yeah.

454
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,990
Alright, I'm on Watson.

455
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,150
Alright, I have you selected, Clay.

456
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,910
Just unlocked him.

457
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,090
Okay.

458
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,070
Oh my god, you scared me.

459
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:11,850
Where the fuck is Watson?

460
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:12,450
Oh, there he is.

461
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,470
Hey, fuck!

462
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,310
He's like, wait, my bank card.

463
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,070
Yeah.

464
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,570
We're champion at Tostik.

465
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,970
So you have Fuse not unlocked, but you have a skin for him.

466
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,770
How does that work?

467
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,490
Yeah, how does that work?

468
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,430
I spent a lot of money on this game.

469
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:26,970
I'll just say that.

470
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,870
And not Fuse?

471
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,970
Wait, you spent money on a free-to-play game?

472
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,930
Yeah, I'm living free on this game.

473
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,630
No, because like when there's the Heirloom events, like, I'll buy out the events, so I'll get certain skins.

474
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,130
So you spent money on a free-to-play game, so you spent...

475
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,210
Alright, drop us to victory.

476
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,410
I'm gonna go get some skins.

477
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm gonna go get some skins.

478
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,430
I don't get how you think that justifies you spending money on events.

479
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,370
But it really doesn't.

480
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,590
Like, I do not want to look at my, like, Steam purchase history for this game.

481
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,690
I'll actually cry, I think.

482
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,630
Mentally I'll never be able to recover.

483
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,010
That's okay.

484
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,050
I actually spent money on the Mirage statue, so it's okay.

485
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,050
Recently, like, I was kind of spending money on this game, and then recently, I haven't been.

486
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,450
I've been getting things for free, you know?

487
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,290
Yeah, that's...

488
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:09,990
Yeah, me too!

489
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,590
You know those epic stacks that I got?

490
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,670
Yeah, the destroyer one, right?

491
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:13,990
2000.

492
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,010
The destroyer packs.

493
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,210
The destroyer packs.

494
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,550
Yo, that guy is hurting me for real!

495
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,250
He gave me two and a half for free!

496
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,550
Bro, is he in chat right now?

497
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,070
You wanna hack us real quick again?

498
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,190
He saved me $300 from this event!

499
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,190
I'm just saying!

500
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,210
Alright, let's lock in.

501
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,830
Alright, look, if things don't do so well, maybe he'll hack your game and you'll be back to life or something.

502
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,890
Okay, I'm gonna grab...

503
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,510
We can grab healers and stuff, right?

504
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,670
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,930
Yeah, I mean, that would be fucked up if we can.

506
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,870
I'm not gonna lie, I grabbed, like, a flatline vault.

507
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,990
I was ready to shoot.

508
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,730
Oh my god!

509
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,550
Wait, can we, like, grab guns and throw the guns at them to distract them?

510
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,790
I thought that worked.

511
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,230
Oh, no, no, no!

512
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,990
Wait, no!

513
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,350
Imagine guns are damaged when you throw at them.

514
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,510
No, think of it this way.

515
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,290
We grab the gun, throw it at them, and then they shoot us and then they get disqualified.

516
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,030
Oh my god.

517
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,110
Because they think they pick it up!

518
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,490
You might be cooking a little too hard.

519
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,210
You're cooking too much food!

520
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,990
What do you mean?

521
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,150
They're gonna, like, pick up the gun and then... they'll pick up the gun accidentally because you throw it at them.

522
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,190
And then they shoot at them.

523
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,330
Oh my god.

524
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,570
Then they get disqualified for using the gun.

525
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:19,850
Oh my god.

526
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,890
Because they didn't think we can't have it in our inventory.

527
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,270
I can't.

528
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,810
It works!

529
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,430
I bet you that.

530
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,290
Can you hear me fusing?

531
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,050
Wait, so, can you have a gun on you, though?

532
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,350
We won't be using it.

533
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:37,950
I don't know.

534
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,170
What if you shoot it, like, accidentally?

535
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,750
It's not fun.

536
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,030
Yeah, but if you don't shoot it at a person, it should be fine, right?

537
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,370
Okay, I'm carrying an alternator.

538
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,190
You're gonna carry an alternator.

539
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,250
I'm carrying an alternate.

540
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,050
I'm carrying it.

541
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,990
Why are you throwing the gun at a person?

542
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,510
Oh my god, we should throw a gun at a person.

543
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,190
I have a Mozambique too.

544
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,070
Oh my god.

545
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,870
Wait, Tempo's watching!

546
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,010
Fuck, Joppa, he's in my chat!

547
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:57,830
He said he's watching!

548
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:58,910
Joppa, Joppa, Joppa, Joppa.

549
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,090
Throw the gun!

550
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,030
Throw the gun!

551
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,790
Drop the gun!

552
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,310
Drop the fucking gun!

553
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,270
It was an accident!

554
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,450
It was an accident!

555
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,550
Yo, Tempo, bro, come on.

556
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,170
I didn't know I had it on.

557
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,770
It was just like my brain was automated to loot.

558
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,890
Yeah, he's a controller player.

559
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,070
You should...

560
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,810
Help me.

561
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,370
You think they actually think about what they're doing?

562
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,790
He's literally a controller player.

563
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,930
Alright, I'm gonna get this juicer.

564
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:19,890
Someone get this one here.

565
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,810
Oh, okay, okay.

566
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,610
That one.

567
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,910
Can you land over here?

568
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,010
I don't... I don't think so.

569
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,970
Oh my god.

570
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,730
There's a Giga tower over there.

571
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,750
You know, we should've gotten Octane and had an Octane just walk right around picking up the things.

572
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,850
Wait, is someone here?

573
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,690
Yo, what's up, girl?

574
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,730
Wait, are they going for the thing?

575
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,250
They should be going for the armor.

576
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,490
I guess we hit this one here.

577
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,350
I'm starting off.

578
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,730
Alright, do we want the revive 50 HP or the falling stars one?

579
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,570
Oh, the falling stars, I think.

580
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,710
Falling stars?

581
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,190
Okay.

582
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,170
Which one do I get, actually?

583
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:53,790
Falling range.

584
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,690
Wait, which one do I get?

585
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,990
Guys, we're doing well.

586
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,690
You wanna see how far I fall?

587
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,450
Look at this shit, bye!

588
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,250
Alright, guys, guys, we gotta get the other one.

589
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,670
Oh my god, bro, we gotta go to the Olympics.

590
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,450
Holy fuck.

591
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,290
Holy shit, shot put master.

592
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,290
Oh my god.

593
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,270
Alright, let's grab this one and then we should find some...

594
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,350
Oh my god.

595
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,510
We got some stuff to open, too.

596
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,730
Oh wait, I can do the ring console.

597
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,090
Wait, wait, wait, I'm gonna split up.

598
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,910
Yeah, okay, let's get the juicer and then get the ring console.

599
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,350
And open our salt bin.

601
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,070
There's no way I'll get punched out on the ring console.

602
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,970
There's no fucking way.

603
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,570
No, no, no, no, if they do, I'll just snade them.

604
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,570
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm gonna...

605
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,470
I'll make a ring...

606
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,170
I'll make a ring around the ring console.

607
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,610
So they can't...

608
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,570
So they can't...

609
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,810
I can't come punch you this way.

610
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,730
They can't punch me out if there's a barrier.

611
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,010
This is it.

612
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,070
Alright, here we go.

613
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,790
Oh my gosh, my brain is cooking up some...

614
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,210
...six shots for this.

615
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,050
We just need tempo to not watch and we'll be fine.

616
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,350
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

617
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,010
There's people here.

618
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,250
They punched a barrel?!

619
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,090
I can't see them.

620
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,690
Whoa.

621
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,630
Oh god.

622
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,810
I just saw that man fucking...

623
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,090
...punch the loop... the loop cart.

624
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,110
Like, out of the sky?

625
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,610
Yeah!

626
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,230
Oh my god.

627
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,910
Bro, he was gaming!

628
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,150
Guys, okay.

629
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,370
Alright, Jenny, I'm gonna...

630
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,910
Wait, actually, I'm gonna make a ring around the thing.

631
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,130
I'm gonna make traps over here.

632
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,470
We gotta surround ourselves.

634
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,190
Hit that shit.

635
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:29,810
Okay.

636
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,830
I can hit it too.

637
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

638
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,670
Don't worry.

639
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,550
I'm gonna surround you.

640
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,610
So they can't...

641
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,430
But you put me in a cage, bro!

642
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:37,870
That's right.

643
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,870
Alright.

644
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,010
We're...

645
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,050
We're two armors.

646
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,290
There's a...

647
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,850
There are two armor bins away.

648
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,430
Alright.

649
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:46,990
Alright.

650
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,370
From the purple.

651
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,210
Is that good for this one here?

652
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,010
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:49,410
I'll get that.

654
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,690
Get that one and then I'm gonna get this one here.

655
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

656
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,190
Don't worry.

657
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:54,750
Wait.

658
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,250
No, we don't have any supporter.

659
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,070
I was gonna say we could craft ourselves, but we can't.

660
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,370
We can't craft ourselves.

661
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,790
Alright, I'm grabbing the other bin.

662
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,430
I desperately need a backpack.

663
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,970
You can't carry all these nades.

664
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,310
I only have two...

665
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,190
I only have two nades.

666
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,770
Wait.

667
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,150
One team died already.

668
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,430
Wait.

669
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,190
How did they...

670
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,750
We're not 20th...

671
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,490
They got shit on!

672
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:17,910
I don't know.

673
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,710
Bro!

674
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,910
How are you that bad?

675
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,090
Bro!

676
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,470
How are you that bad?

677
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,170
Bro!

678
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,330
How are you that bad?

679
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:23,750
Bro!

680
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,110
If Doki say, how are you that bad?

681
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,530
It's over.

682
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:25,950
Jesus.

683
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,490
Oh my god.

684
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,110
Oh my god.

685
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,470
Oh my god.

686
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,750
Oh my god.

687
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:28,770
Oh my god.

688
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,210
You know...

689
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,810
You know who was the 20th place?

690
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,010
You know who was the 20th place?

691
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:32,890
But Design died apparently.

692
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,750
Design!

693
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,930
No way.

694
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,650
No way.

695
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,210
We've got a shot team.

696
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,870
Bro!

697
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,390
Bro!

698
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,570
Bro!

699
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,230
That's really sad though, right?

700
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,550
That's embarrassing.

701
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,050
Okay, I'm just gonna stand here in the open and look carefully at my abilities.

702
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,690
Not last officially achieved.

703
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,550
He threw some knuckle...

704
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:49,730
Wait.

705
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,090
I think...

706
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,950
Minus 50% explosive damage.

707
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,670
I feel like that's wrong.

708
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,410
Should we get red armor?

709
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,130
Probably?

710
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,690
I don't know.

711
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,250
Should we just get zoned?

712
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,850
We might as well.

713
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,230
We might as well.

714
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,110
I mean, I feel like zoned doesn't really matter, right?

715
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,570
Oh, yeah.

716
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,630
Chur's gonna run around the...

717
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,250
Yeah, everybody's just running around.

718
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,670
Who does he...

719
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:03,970
Can we pull it up?

720
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,850
I feel like...

721
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,610
No, I think we should be together because I feel like people are actually gonna...

722
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,310
Because everybody's just gonna...

723
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:09,910
Yeah, everybody else is gonna...

724
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,910
Oh, do you have any OX allosoki?

725
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,470
No.

726
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,290
Wait, someone landed behind me.

727
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,950
Oh, I have one.

728
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,570
You good?

729
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:14,790
You good?

730
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,510
You're good.

731
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:15,790
You're good.

732
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,970
Wait, I can pick that up.

733
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,670
Yeah, we need all the...

735
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,430
All right, I'm gonna go to...

736
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm gonna hit the gen.

737
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,410
All right, Dohki, did you put the...

738
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,450
Did you get the two generators?

739
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,130
The two gen...

740
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,470
Yeah, I did.

741
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,750
I did.

742
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,130
Don't worry.

743
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:27,370
Nice.

744
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,030
Nice.

745
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,190
I got you.

746
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,930
There's no...

747
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,850
I saw a lot of fuses, so thank god we're watching.

748
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,650
Guys, it's a little scary at endgame.

749
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,530
Oh, it's gonna be awful.

750
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:41,910
I feel like we should...

751
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,370
Oh, we can get another ring console.

752
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,630
We should get that.

753
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,010
Yeah, ring console.

754
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,150
Oh, should we get this one too?

755
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

756
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,010
We should just get...

757
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,530
Grab one in the 40.

758
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

760
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,050
Just grab everything so we can have red armor in the end.

761
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:52,930
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,450
Okay.

763
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,310
We just...

764
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,570
The moment we hit late game, we're GG's.

765
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,170
It's gonna be...

766
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,510
We're good to go.

767
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,370
We have like, Watson for two.

768
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,530
Your brain is working over time, you know?

769
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,810
I think like...

770
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,870
I mean, if we really...

771
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,770
Do you know end zones, Jen?

772
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:11,310
Really?

773
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:11,690
Yeah.

774
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,770
You have to.

775
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:12,990
Okay.

776
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,090
I was like, there's no way you don't.

777
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:14,690
No, no.

778
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,870
There's some pros that don't.

779
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,070
There's...

780
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,950
No, no.

781
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,090
Wait, wait, wait.

782
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,550
What are you trying to say?

783
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:18,890
Huh?

784
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,790
What are you trying to say?

785
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,210
What are you trying to say?

786
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,150
I'm just trying to say that you're one of the pros that do know it.

787
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,190
I hit the 50-50.

788
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,230
But the others, why?

789
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,170
Is it because they're on the import or...

790
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,770
I don't know.

791
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,410
What are you trying to imply?

792
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,970
What do you mean by input?

793
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,770
What do you...

794
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,230
Well, you used to play the game.

795
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,170
What do you mean?

796
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,190
I didn't imply anything.

797
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:41,850
I never...

798
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,390
I just said some pros just don't know.

799
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,750
Are you trying to say controller players are too stupid to know?

800
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,130
Yeah, that's true.

801
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,490
I'm not even gonna deny it.

802
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,630
Okay.

803
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,450
I put a cage around this one.

804
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,530
So, if anyone wants to...

805
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:57,810
Deny.

806
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,090
Do that.

807
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:58,510
I'm not even gonna deny it.

808
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:58,550
So, if anyone wants to...

809
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,050
Do that.

810
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,270
Do that.

811
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,290
Do that.

812
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,490
That ring comes so they can't...

813
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,870
I'm gonna go grab this armour.

814
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,090
Wait, there's somebody in here.

815
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,910
What, I'm grabbing this juicer.

816
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,630
Okay.

817
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,730
Grabbing that juicer?

818
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,470
Wait, okay.

819
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,750
Do you think I'd be safe if I grab the other armour one?

820
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,190
I should be.

821
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,150
That one?

822
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,490
That one?

823
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,490
There's people right here on me, so...

824
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,090
Oh, yeah, yeah.

825
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,010
Don't worry.

826
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,710
There's no way.

827
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,690
There's no way I'm going to get my chip beater.

828
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,770
Oh, wait, do I have EVAX?

829
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,150
EVAX could be just...

830
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,250
I do not have any...

831
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,690
No, I have a mobile reason.

832
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,610
I'm gonna punch people on the evac so they can keep taking over and over again.

833
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,390
The sky fees me.

834
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,250
Woah!

835
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,110
I was watching them.

836
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,950
Are you on top?

837
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,550
Spoons?

838
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,430
No, no, no.

839
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,950
Oh, no, right here.

840
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,890
There's a lot of people fighting here right now.

841
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,870
Okay, wait, Jhin, what's endgame?

842
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,090
Endgame is, um, literally... on us.

843
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,810
Oh, someone is pushing.

844
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,070
Oh, it is?

845
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,210
Okay, I'm gonna head over to you.

846
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,470
It's fine, you'll be fine, you'll be fine, just run.

847
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,010
Uh-oh.

848
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,430
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

849
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:51,810
Just run.

850
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,930
They're right on top of you.

851
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,930
Just run.

852
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,130
I'm heading to Jhin.

853
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,150
I'm running.

854
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,310
I can't take the balloon to you guys.

855
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,370
Wait, I'm literally right with you.

856
00:22:59,550 --> 00:22:59,910
Can we play like a piece of shit?

857
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

858
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,550
Can we play like a piece of shit?

859
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,090
Wait, right here.

860
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,230
Wait, they're fucking coming.

861
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,050
No, they're not, they're too free.

862
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,110
They're like on you.

863
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,590
There's no, no, no, don't look back.

864
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,950
If you don't look back, you're not there.

865
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,450
Right, they're actually gonna punch us.

866
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,570
In a way.

867
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,590
Yo, peace out, bro.

868
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,090
The fuck?

869
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,590
Woah!

870
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,830
What are they doing?

871
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,570
They're wasting names.

872
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,790
Play this corner, play this corner.

873
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,350
Okay.

874
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,550
What the fuck are they doing?

875
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,110
They're wasting good, valuable names.

876
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:20,910
It's fine, it's fine, they're dumb.

877
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,630
Yeah, they're so dumb, I know.

878
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,510
Keep doing it, keep throwing your names.

879
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:24,790
They have to be controller.

880
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,930
This guy's definitely controller.

881
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,530
Oh, fuck it!

882
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,530
Yeah, yeah, run.

883
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,370
Yeah, fucking run.

884
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,410
We didn't waste our names.

885
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,570
We have a fuse for that.

886
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,290
Okay, look, I made us a little ring.

887
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,050
Okay, they have a den now.

888
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,850
I have like seven, eight grenades.

889
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,410
Alright, nice.

890
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,770
I have a...

891
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,290
I think nine.

892
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,270
I have two.

893
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,390
I didn't loot that much.

894
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,810
I just realized I did.

895
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,950
I might not have looted as much as I wanted.

896
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,970
Just keep breaking the fences, spoons and shit.

897
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,450
I just don't know if they have gen up yet.

899
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,410
You want a generator?

900
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,390
No, I couldn't tell if they have.

901
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,130
No, they do have a generator.

902
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,330
No, they don't.

903
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,670
This team has a gen.

904
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,690
He's just sitting there.

905
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:11,930
Does that team have a gen?

906
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,610
Which team?

907
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,190
Yeah, they do.

908
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,050
Everybody has a gen.

909
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,190
I'm not gonna waste my gen, because no one's throwing names at us.

910
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:20,250
Actually, I'm gonna throw a gen.

911
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,970
Actually, maybe I should.

912
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,370
Actually.

913
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,150
They can't get rid of this.

914
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,610
I have two pylons, too.

915
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,090
Nice.

916
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,430
He's looking.

917
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,070
Oh my god, I'm pulled down on my thing.

918
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,630
What's up, bruh?

919
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,130
Alright, this is our space.

920
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,190
Get out.

921
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,590
Wait, how much more...

922
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,170
How many more fences?

923
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:39,910
I have two more fences.

924
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,610
You can pull a 12 down?

925
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:41,910
How many?

926
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,570
I broke their fence.

927
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,090
Two more.

928
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,930
How many Sofus and Mijigas?

929
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,570
I'm just gonna make it longer.

930
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,190
Don't worry.

931
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:48,730
It's fine.

932
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,230
I'm just gonna make it longer.

933
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,830
Oh, look at them.

934
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,470
Look at their baby cage.

935
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,450
We have so much space here.

936
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,570
Yeah, literally.

937
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,190
Look at our space.

938
00:24:59,650 --> 00:24:59,690
Oh, I got him again.

939
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,190
Get shit on.

940
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,850
Yeah, waste your gen.

941
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,330
I'm just breaking their fences because they're setting it really far from their gen.

942
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,410
People playing Newcastle, that's troll.

943
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,830
I guess...

944
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,110
Oh, I think for endgame.

945
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,070
That's really good for endgame.

946
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,110
Well, Newcastle's not gonna save them from costing gas.

947
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,250
That's true.

948
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,830
That's true.

949
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,590
Have you guys seen any gibbies yet?

950
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,550
I don't think I've seen a gibby.

951
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,730
Me neither.

952
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,430
I haven't seen a crypto yet either, honestly.

953
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,950
This is good because you can hold like two grenades per slot.

954
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,710
Yeah.

955
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,090
Yeah, yeah.

956
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,110
Wait, they took away my space.

957
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,750
I'm gonna steal their fences here.

958
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,250
Okay, I can break that in five seconds.

959
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:32,650
Okay.

960
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,750
Wait, I still want to...

961
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,990
Haha!

962
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,870
Oh, okay.

963
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,310
They connected to mine.

964
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,970
Dude, I dare you to put a fence down.

965
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,430
Yeah, fucking do it, coward.

966
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,330
Oh, they took them again.

967
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,290
Come on.

968
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,630
What the fuck are you doing, Jen?

969
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,070
What are you doing?

970
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,210
My fucking gen.

971
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:49,530
Oh, my god.

972
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,450
What?

973
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,810
Wait, they're grabbing reinforcements.

974
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,090
No!

975
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,430
That's fucked up.

976
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,870
That's fucked up.

977
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,350
Get out.

978
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,550
That's fucking right.

979
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:57,790
Leave.

980
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,230
I have nades too.

981
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,830
Leave.

982
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,930
No, I want to go back.

983
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,290
I dare you to move away.

984
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,950
Wait, how do I...

985
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,650
Wait, break their fences here so I can take their fence.

986
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:14,310
Oh, yeah, yeah.

987
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,090
Wait, actually, no, no, don't break it.

988
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:15,610
Oh, fuck!

989
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,630
Oh, shit!

990
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:17,910
Oh, god.

991
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,550
Okay, don't worry.

992
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:18,750
Don't worry.

993
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,150
I'm good.

994
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,430
I'm good.

995
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,530
I'm good.

996
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,750
I have a nade.

997
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,690
I have a nade.

998
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:21,950
Leave!

999
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,390
Leave!

1000
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,890
Don't make me throw this nade.

1001
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,230
Don't make me...

1002
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,310
Oh, you guys, I'll do it.

1003
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,110
Don't make me...

1004
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,450
Oh, my god, that tap straight.

1005
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,430
Wait, did you throw a nade?

1006
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,510
Oh, no, that's your canister.

1007
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,990
I'm going to throw it at their head.

1008
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,050
You're going to throw...

1009
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,610
Chuck it.

1010
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,350
Wait, how far can you chuck the...

1011
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,490
We're literally in guns.

1012
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,150
See, I told you.

1013
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:46,590
We're chilling.

1014
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,550
Oh, nice.

1015
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,810
Okay.

1016
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:47,870
Let's get away.

1017
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,670
Oh, my god.

1018
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,530
Let's go to the side door.

1019
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,150
I don't know which side.

1020
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,890
It could be this side or this side.

1021
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,470
It's probably our side.

1022
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,230
Oh, my god.

1023
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,150
Okay.

1024
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,950
As long as...

1025
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,910
We're in a perfect spot.

1026
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:56,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,050
We're okay.

1028
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,010
This team has to move forward to us then.

1029
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,690
Oh, he's fucking with you.

1030
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,670
This team has to move to us.

1031
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:01,910
Red.

1032
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,310
We should try farming to red, kind of.

1033
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,150
Yeah, yeah, we should.

1034
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:07,650
We should.

1035
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,610
I have a thousand.

1036
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,710
He's trying to stick me, bro.

1037
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,270
What the fuck?

1038
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,610
Bro, what is he going to do?

1039
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,230
After he sticks you, he plucks you?

1040
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,830
If they stick you, I will literally ult you guys.

1041
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,210
Okay.

1042
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,290
Don't worry.

1043
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,030
And then you'll have to fight to death in the ring of fire.

1044
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,670
No!

1045
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,230
Wait, that's smart.

1046
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,550
We can spawn in the unlimited arc stars, by the way.

1047
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,070
Do you have the perk?

1048
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1049
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,810
I have the spawn arc stars.

1050
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,130
This should do it.

1052
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,090
Okay, hold up.

1053
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,030
But I can't do it for myself?

1054
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,250
I don't...

1055
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,390
He didn't spawn any yet.

1056
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,090
It's because we haven't thrown anything at our gen yet.

1057
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:38,690
Oh.

1058
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,830
Oh, wait.

1059
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,550
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1060
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:40,850
Can I...

1061
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,450
Can I Q this?

1062
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,030
Wait, wait.

1063
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,850
What if I...

1064
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,690
Wait, they're rotating.

1065
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:47,990
They're rotating.

1066
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,770
Look, cowards.

1067
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,630
They're cowards.

1068
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,710
Actual pussy.

1069
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,230
Oh my gosh.

1070
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,410
Yeah.

1071
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,470
I'm gonna punch their gen.

1072
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,290
Wait.

1073
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,490
Did they spawn on the arc star?

1074
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,070
Did they do it again?

1075
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:55,450
What?

1076
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:55,730
Wait.

1077
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:55,870
Wait.

1078
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,290
They don't know.

1079
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,590
I don't know where they're falling.

1080
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,310
Okay, they patched it.

1081
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:01,810
They patched it.

1082
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,490
Wait, did they?

1083
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:03,830
Oh.

1084
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,870
I bet the enemy has to do it, yeah.

1085
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,390
No.

1086
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,630
They took over.

1087
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,970
They took over the area.

1088
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,110
Okay.

1089
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,930
I'll break the fence again in seven seconds.

1090
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,770
Can't believe it.

1091
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:15,930
I'm gonna...

1092
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,270
Okay.

1093
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,070
I'm gonna pick up this and then cage them here.

1094
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,750
You're gonna cage them?

1095
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,850
I'm gonna cage them here.

1097
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:25,310
They're in my gas!

1098
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,710
They're gas in the gas tank!

1099
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,930
Oh my god, nice, nice.

1100
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:29,990
Yeah, that's right.

1101
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,670
I can put one good grenade on the...

1102
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,050
Oh shit, wait, there's people in here!

1103
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,950
Oh shit, okay, never mind.

1104
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,710
I'm gonna... you're not caged anymore.

1105
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,970
Those weirdos.

1106
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,730
Oh, they put another gen there too.

1107
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,830
I'm gonna put a fence here.

1108
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:44,970
Alright.

1109
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,670
Do you have traps though?

1110
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,070
A loba?

1111
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,790
What the fuck are you gonna do with a loba?

1112
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,510
There's no loot here.

1113
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,290
Nobody's dead.

1114
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,190
There's literally 19 squads.

1115
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,330
That is a brain dead thing.

1116
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,390
What are you gonna get?

1117
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,710
Wait, wait, is one team a rat?

1118
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,290
Nooooo?

1119
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,990
Question mark?

1120
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,010
Oh, no, someone just died.

1121
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,170
I can't do math.

1122
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,810
We can play!

1123
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,450
Start setting up here, come here.

1124
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,450
Start setting up here.

1125
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,810
Alright, don't worry, I got you.

1126
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,570
Wait, wait, I'm gonna grab these fences.

1127
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,970
On this rock.

1128
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,410
Yeah, yeah, quick, quick, quick.

1129
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,350
Okay.

1130
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:22,970
Extending.

1131
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,770
Oh, someone on you!

1132
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:24,890
Woooah!

1133
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,310
What the fuck?

1134
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,870
Don't worry!

1135
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,910
Oh, oh my god!

1136
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,390
I'll do it!

1137
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,030
We'll have to get back to it.

1138
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,410
It's fine!

1139
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:31,730
We're fine!

1140
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,090
I'm putting as many fences as possible!

1141
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,670
They're in my fence!

1142
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,830
Oh my god, I'm seeing an orange stone!

1143
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,150
What the fuck?

1144
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,890
Put fucking fences down!

1145
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,310
But they're in my fences!

1146
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:42,810
They're in my fences!

1147
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,150
They're in my fences!

1148
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,370
They're in my fences!

1149
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:43,710
They're in my fences!

1150
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,150
Oh my god!

1151
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,930
They're still trying to punch it!

1152
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,290
The fucking hell, man!

1153
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,750
They're punching the fence!

1154
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,250
They're punching the fences!

1155
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,190
It's okay, we're fine.

1156
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,170
I'm punching the fence!

1157
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,910
Wait, go!

1158
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,070
Go, go, go, go!

1159
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,210
You're fucking crazy!

1160
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:58,990
Oh god.

1161
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,870
There we go!

1162
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,990
Don't worry, I connected everything.

1163
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,230
There are more traps down there.

1164
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,730
Bro, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1165
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,790
Wait, who's there?

1166
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,370
Who's on the fence?!

1167
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,150
It's okay.

1168
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:12,810
It's okay.

1169
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,750
Someone else is blocking right here.

1170
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,410
It's okay, we still... they can't come in.

1171
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,910
We gotta chill, we gotta chill.

1172
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,030
They can't come in here.

1173
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,230
They're still trying to punch my fences, but I'm just putting them back.

1174
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,950
Oh my god.

1176
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,270
Fuck you, Kosti!

1177
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,510
Yeah, fuck off!

1178
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,110
Lucky bitch!

1179
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,990
Kosti, try to break the wall!

1180
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,950
It's okay, it's okay, we're fine, we're fine.

1181
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,390
I still have my fences, we're fine.

1182
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,010
No, no, no!

1183
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:41,890
Come on!

1184
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,910
What's with all these mobis?

1185
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:43,690
Oh god.

1186
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:45,910
Oh god, oh god.

1187
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,370
Okay, we don't have fences on our backs anymore, by the way.

1188
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,130
I got lots of them.

1189
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:49,990
Okay, nice.

1190
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,630
Oh my god, I was gonna stick one.

1191
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,850
No!

1192
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,090
Oh, I'm okay.

1193
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,410
Oh my god, they're still fucking fencing it up!

1194
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,110
Okay, jump down, jump down!

1195
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,730
We can play on me too.

1196
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,130
Maybe start fencing this side.

1197
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,710
Come, come, come.

1198
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,710
Right here, right here.

1199
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,410
Fuck those guys, I don't like them.

1200
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,950
They have ult?

1201
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,490
No, no, no, no, I don't.

1202
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,330
We gotta protect the gen then.

1203
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we gotta protect it.

1204
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,850
They're throwing nades and stuff on our gen.

1205
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:17,710
We're fine.

1206
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,930
I'm 62%.

1207
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,690
I have ult, I'll try to use it.

1208
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,310
Okay, the end...

1209
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,750
Okay, okay.

1210
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:25,910
I'm gonna...

1211
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,930
I can put a gen down...

1212
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,930
I have a gen, I have a gen.

1213
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,150
Yeah, okay.

1214
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,750
I'm gonna do it.

1215
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,210
And then ult, excel for the next one.

1216
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,990
I already used my ult, excel for this gen.

1217
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,530
Yeah, yeah.

1218
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,190
Unless you guys have...

1219
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,910
No, I gave you my only one.

1220
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,250
I'll try and break some stuff over here.

1221
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,550
Okay, I have a ring.

1222
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,330
I have a ring!

1223
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,510
We're gonna have to start breaking fences soon.

1224
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:54,290
We're gonna have to start breaking fences soon.

1225
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:54,950
I'm breaking, hold up.

1226
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,390
Okay, okay.

1227
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,790
Bro.

1228
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,030
This team is still here.

1229
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,910
Oh, I said nothing!

1230
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,610
Okay, we have...

1231
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,610
It's okay.

1232
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,750
Everything's fine.

1233
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,430
Everything's fine.

1234
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,290
We gotta keep breaking their fences.

1235
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,190
We have...

1236
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:12,870
Oh my god.

1237
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,410
Oh, yo, chill bro!

1238
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,750
They're trying to fight, yo.

1239
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,010
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1240
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,410
We're good, we're good.

1241
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:20,910
On the left.

1242
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,410
We're fine.

1243
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,850
They're breaking the fences for us!

1244
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,490
They're breaking it for us!

1245
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,850
They're clearing the path!

1246
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,190
We're actually chilling.

1247
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,370
They cleared the path, they cleared the path!

1248
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,910
We just need them to clear... Yeah, look, look, look!

1249
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,250
They cleared the path for us!

1250
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,470
All my ping!

1251
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:38,730
Okay.

1252
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,730
This is gonna be hell.

1253
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,890
This is actually gonna be a dead end!

1254
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,350
We can't use them!

1255
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,330
I'm good, I'm good.

1256
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,930
We have to move up soon.

1257
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,210
We have to put a generator like here.

1258
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,630
I don't have it, I don't have it!

1259
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,690
Did you use the ulti-kill?

1260
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,430
Yeah, I already used it for our other gen.

1261
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,830
When did you get a new one?

1262
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,070
Oh, far.

1263
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,210
We used their gens!

1264
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,090
They have gens that we can use!

1265
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,690
It'll be fine.

1266
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,070
We used their generators.

1267
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,930
We can't name anyone!

1268
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,910
So fun!

1269
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,010
Push this condo out!

1270
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,730
Yeah, yeah, they're smacking fences!

1271
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,330
We have to start...

1272
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,730
Guys, we have to start the slowing fences.

1273
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,730
Close it, close it!

1274
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,490
The fuse!

1275
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,010
Oh my god.

1276
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,710
They're so many.

1277
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,290
No way, I can't even ult, man.

1278
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,910
Go on the care package!

1279
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,170
Wait, the care package, maybe the care package.

1280
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,270
Oh my god, I messed up!

1281
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,430
I'm going on the care package!

1282
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,950
Guys, I'm not doing so well, guys.

1283
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,630
I'm not okay!

1284
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:41,990
I'm not okay!

1285
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,050
I'm fucking chilling on the care package!

1286
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,170
I'm sucking on you!

1287
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,810
The care package is very good!

1288
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,190
Guys, it is hell.

1289
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,350
Wait, wait, put the shield.

1290
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,710
I don't know which one you guys are.

1291
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,490
Do you feel the shield?

1292
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,950
That's me, that's me, that's me.

1293
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,470
You good like turkey?

1294
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:58,830
You good?

1295
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,430
No, I'm not!

1296
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,230
I don't feel good!

1297
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,550
Bro, what the fuck?

1298
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,510
I don't feel so good!

1299
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,030
Bro, I got knocked out!

1300
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,690
Jack, this sucks to you!

1301
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,470
What the fuck is going on?

1302
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,190
I'm trying, I'm trying!

1303
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,070
Oh my god, I can't move!

1304
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:21,910
I can't move!

1305
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,280
Oh my god!

1306
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,720
I'm getting placement!

1307
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,400
Oh my god!

1308
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,420
No!

1309
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,120
I'm insane!

1310
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,320
Who won?

1311
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,720
Who won?

1312
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,660
Bro, what the fuck?

1313
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,280
That was fucking insane!

1314
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,620
Where was the crypto we needed?

1315
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,340
Nobody picked crypto!

1316
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,420
I could not move!

1317
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,460
Holy shit!

1318
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,480
The fuck was that gangbang man?

1319
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,360
Jesus Christ!

1320
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,860
Oh my god!

1321
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,400
That is actually crazy!

1322
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,400
I could not move!

1323
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,320
No, I got blocked by 20 people in front of me!

1324
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,660
I was stuck!

1325
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,260
We got six though!

1326
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,720
Nice, nice!

1327
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,880
No one crypto for real!

1328
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,760
No one went crypto, so there was just offenses everywhere!

1329
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,200
The Newcastle won!

1330
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,980
Holy fuck!

1331
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,700
Newcastle won dude!

1332
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,380
The Newcastle wants to play!

1333
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,600
Who would've thought?

1334
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,640
Newcastle and Valkyrie, dang!

1335
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,200
Oh my god!

1336
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
What even happened?

1337
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,360
Yo, we got 400 bucks off that though!

1338
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,220
Fucking take it!

1339
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,360
How much did we win?

1340
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,280
400!

1341
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,060
400?

1342
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,720
Easy!

1343
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,420
Okay, now for the rest of the game, just throw.

1344
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1345
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,680
Now you don't have to try anymore.

1346
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1347
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,280
Are you sure?

1348
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm racking up the bag.

1349
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,720
Yeah, you already got that money.

1350
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,420
You already got the 400 dollars.

1351
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,320
You can just relax now.

1352
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,840
Maybe try MNK out for a bit.

1353
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,260
Bro, you can't say that he's actually good at mouse and keyboard!

1354
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,360
Is he?

1355
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,200
Yeah!

1356
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm actually master's level.

1357
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:13,760
Yeah!

1358
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,800
I watched your fucking, what was it, one stream?

1359
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,140
41 hour stream.

1360
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,360
Yeah, the one where you fucking went crazy the longer it went.

1361
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,640
The one on RK.

1362
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,400
Yeah.

1363
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,400
The bronze to field.

1364
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,760
The one where you just started talking to yourself at one point because you were- What?

1365
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,660
When did I do that?

1366
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,200
You did!

1367
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,480
You were starting to talk to yourself in that stream and I was like, this man's not okay.

1368
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,920
Yeah, I was 41 hours deep.

1369
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,780
What are you looking at me?

1370
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,480
Yeah, that's what I meant!

1371
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,140
You were not okay!

1372
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,160
I did a 48 hour before that too.

1373
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,220
And I was talking to myself.

1374
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,940
I was seeing shit.

1375
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,240
You know Mandy got a haircut?

1376
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,500
Mandy got a haircut.

1377
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,960
I saw her on stream live that day.

1378
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,540
And I looked to my wall, right?

1379
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,520
I could see him.

1380
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,460
I could picture it.

1381
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,840
You could see him?

1382
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,080
I could see him, yeah.

1383
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,180
He was right next to me type shit.

1384
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,360
Bro, what the fuck?

1385
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,020
That leopard shit.

1386
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,900
You mean Mandy is your fucking sleep paralysis demon or some shit?

1387
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,820
He might be.

1388
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,720
He's my girlfriend.

1389
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,300
He's my girlfriend.

1390
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,180
Damn.

1391
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,340
Alright, teams are out.

1392
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,980
Oh, I think we got- Wait.

1393
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,320
Oh, we're on the same team again.

1394
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,840
For real?

1395
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,220
Yeah.

1396
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,300
We're on the same team.

1397
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,460
Oh, dang.

1398
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,480
So, we're replacing you with Timmy.

1399
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:32,680
Wait.

1400
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,240
I don't- I can't believe you got replaced with Timmy.

1401
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,120
No lifeline.

1402
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,160
Alright, good luck I guess.

1403
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:40,980
Yeah, good luck.

1404
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,300
Good luck.

1405
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,120
Bye.

1406
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,860
Alright, team 20.

1407
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,860
Alright, let me...

1408
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,360
I'm going to team 20 now.

1409
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,520
Me too.

1410
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,360
Alright, we got this.

1411
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,300
Hello!

1412
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,380
Hello.

1413
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,460
How did your team do, Timmy?

1414
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
We got 12.

1415
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,900
Were you in that clusterfuck?

1416
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,460
We were climbing a rock and someone kamikazed me into the zone.

1417
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,340
And I phased.

1418
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,040
And I spawned in.

1419
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,800
Oh my god.

1420
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,140
Okay, that's good.

1421
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,140
The end game...

1422
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,000
You didn't want to be in that mosh pit.

1423
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,180
That shit was- That mosh pit was fucked up.

1424
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,900
I've never felt so useless.

1425
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,460
I was like, I'm used to standing with a bag full of nades.

1426
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,560
Can't even use them all.

1427
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,560
The fact that there was no crypto.

1428
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,700
Nobody actually picked a crypto.

1429
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,040
It was very surprising.

1430
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,540
One person at least got to play crypto.

1431
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,860
Everyone was like, I know the other team is going to play crypto.

1432
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,400
Everyone was like, I know the other team is going to play crypto.

1433
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,860
I was like, Watson, Caustic, Fuse, and then of course the Newcastle team won.

1434
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,100
That was pretty shocking.

1435
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,400
Wait, okay, but- Newcastle is the move.

1436
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,700
Yeah, but the thing is, the next one is three strikes.

1437
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,960
And it doesn't say no Newcastle.

1438
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,800
Just no Lifeline.

1439
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,820
It also says, it doesn't say no Mirage.

1440
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,700
Okay, okay, I was going to say, what the fuck was play Mirage?

1441
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,700
But I'm like- Wait, wait, wait, I want to do Mirage.

1442
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,680
Wait, I want to be Mirage.

1443
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Yeah, go for it, go for it.

1444
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,180
Okay, I need...

1445
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,460
people to leave team 20 so we can join team 20.

1446
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,640
Um, so, I also unfortunately cannot play Newcastle.

1447
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,580
I could try.

1448
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,900
Wait, wait, wait.

1449
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,700
What should we do for comp then?

1450
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,940
Well, I can play Newcastle if you want to play Mirage.

1451
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,480
I'm down for that too.

1452
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,520
Yeah, yeah, because I've like, you know, I've played Newcastle in...

1453
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,460
Lifeline and Three Strikes because I'm that fucked up as a person.

1454
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,800
Oh no, no, I definitely played Lifeline and Three Strikes.

1455
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,280
Whatever it takes.

1456
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,280
Whatever it takes to win, you know, pubs are that important for the regular person.

1457
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,740
We don't have much.

1458
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,740
Yeah, yeah.

1459
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,640
Okay, um, honestly I haven't played, like, uh, Three Strikes in a while.

1460
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,800
So, I mean, I know that obviously the comp is Lifeline, Newcastle.

1461
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,820
Yeah, but we can't have Lifeline.

1462
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,700
Yeah.

1463
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,140
So I think Newcastle...

1464
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,680
I do think people are probably going to play Conduit as well.

1465
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,120
Yeah, true.

1466
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,040
Conduit's really good.

1467
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,420
I can also play Conduit.

1468
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,220
Yeah, it's probably like a Newcastle, Conduit, and I don't really know what that last one would be.

1469
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,360
I think like Mirage, because imagine someone gets downed, you can just crawl forever until you find your little Mirage.

1470
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,500
Yeah, but it doesn't matter because people don't die anyway.

1471
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,020
So, when you're down...

1472
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,780
Yeah, and then you get a little stealth res off.

1473
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:53,020
What I was thinking, is I don't know if it actually works, but if we play Lifeline, I think Lifeline could be good.

1474
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,980
Oh, we can't play Lifeline.

1475
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1476
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,640
Did you get sleep?

1477
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm bricked up in my head right now.

1478
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,680
Jesus Christ.

1479
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,220
Are you okay?

1480
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,640
What happened?

1481
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,720
You get trauma dumped here.

1482
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,460
I got a big dent in my head right now.

1483
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,720
Oh shit!

1484
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,960
Alright, alright.

1485
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,680
So, what are you cooking to me?

1486
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,360
What are you cooking?

1487
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,560
I lost all cookage after that.

1488
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,720
After like Spoons and I was like, you know, there's still a Lifeline three times in a row.

1489
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,040
You guys are saying it too many times that I thought like honestly, yeah, it's been Lifeline.

1490
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,580
You know what?

1491
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,100
What is Temple gonna do?

1492
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,300
Kick me out of scrims?

1493
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,620
He wouldn't.

1494
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,760
Yeah, he would never do that to you.

1495
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,060
He would never.

1496
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,240
He would just kick you out of every tournament he organizes.

1497
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,040
Alright.

1498
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,720
What...

1499
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,260
Um...

1500
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,200
I don't really know.

1501
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,880
I'm not gonna lie.

1502
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,720
Cause we can play um...

1503
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,400
We could play safe.

1504
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,460
If you wanna play safe.

1505
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,900
We could also play like somewhat aggro and such rotate.

1506
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,680
Or we could just play full aggro.

1507
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,960
That's like kind of the three options.

1508
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,300
Well the thing is that Tempo set kills don't matter.

1509
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,240
It's all about placement.

1510
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,260
I think everyone's gonna be playing for placement.

1511
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,500
Which is why we had like 18 squads at like round 5 or something last match.

1512
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,620
Yeah.

1513
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,540
So I think if we play too aggressively we'll just die.

1514
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,580
Also there's like some fucked up teams too.

1515
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,160
There's some like team 4...

1516
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,000
There's team 4.

1517
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,500
There's team 5.

1518
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,080
There's... I don't know how aggressive we can play guys.

1519
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,440
Guys, team 8 with Amu and snipedown.

1520
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,120
The thing about when I played this um...

1521
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,020
There was a tourney back then.

1522
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,980
It was I think before the Evo system was changed.

1523
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,140
We pretty much wanna get red armors before we get to end game.

1524
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,260
Because if we pretty much don't have loot.

1525
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,400
You know what I mean?

1526
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,780
Like if we don't have loot and then we go into the final we're most likely not going to win.

1527
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,820
So we pretty much need triple red armor or roughly purple armors.

1528
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,480
And a lot of meds and nades.

1529
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,920
And I don't know how much we're going to get realistically from our off drop.

1530
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,860
Wait, where are we landing?

1531
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,300
What's our drop point?

1532
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,100
That's a great question.

1533
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,140
I think we go north pad.

1534
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,980
It's okay.

1535
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,100
They will never bully you out of your drop spot.

1536
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,620
You're Timmy.

1537
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,840
Yeah, yeah.

1538
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,140
Right?

1539
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:31,940
Yeah, yeah.

1540
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:32,840
They would never.

1541
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,760
They see your name.

1542
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,080
They're like we can't contest them.

1543
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,160
It's Timmy.

1544
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,280
Yeah.

1545
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,960
Alright, we're gonna go north pad.

1546
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,980
It's gonna be an edge type of um...

1547
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,220
POI.

1548
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,980
We should roughly get purples by the time we leave.

1549
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,900
Um, I I think honestly I'm probably just gonna play Wraith.

1550
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,920
It would be easy.

1551
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,100
And then just do the Newcastle and um...

1552
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,340
What was it?

1553
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,120
Conduit.

1554
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,820
Okay, Newcastle, Conduit.

1555
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,260
Okay.

1556
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,200
Because Conduit is really good for end game when there's a lot of teams.

1557
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,560
You have that Conduit ult, Newcastle Rezzas.

1558
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,200
I could port us back or port us into positions because people are gonna play zone and they're gonna be like a bunch of crazy spots.

1559
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,640
So if I can just port us into a spot and then be Newcastle ult, we should be fine.

1560
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,360
Alright.

1561
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,240
I'll do... I'll be Newcastle.

1562
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,100
And I'm down to Conduit.

1563
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,060
Cool.

1564
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,780
Yeah, look at that.

1565
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,060
Look at you cooking.

1566
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,780
You know, I believe in us.

1567
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,100
I see the vision.

1568
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,460
Yeah, I see Timmy's vision right there.

1569
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1570
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,320
I will let you know there is gonna be a lot of revenant Conduits running around.

1571
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,420
Oh, yeah.

1572
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,580
Oh, revenant.

1573
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,880
If you see a revenant, I think it's best for us to turn around.

1574
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,080
But in general, it's hard to kill a revenant Conduit.

1575
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,080
I played you anyways in ranked.

1576
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,540
But yeah, I do think there...

1577
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,040
I feel like Jen Burton is gonna be on revenant and he will kill us all.

1578
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:00,980
It's okay.

1579
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,860
That's why we have two more choices.

1580
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:09,940
We have two more strikes and then we know where he is so we fly away from there.

1581
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,720
Exactly.

1582
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,240
You fly to the opposite side of the zone and you know you're safe.

1583
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1584
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
Then we'll be fine.

1585
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,460
We'll be fine.

1586
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,600
We're like... we're peaceful.

1587
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,820
Like, what are they gonna do?

1588
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,340
Kill us?

1589
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,160
As long as one of us is standing, they can't.

1590
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,840
So we'll be fine.

1591
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,120
Yeah, there's no way.

1592
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,680
In Apex Legends?

1593
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,340
Newcastle...

1594
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,760
Where the fuck is Newcastle?

1595
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,480
We can craft!

1596
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,600
Oh wait, we don't...

1597
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:44,960
Yeah!

1598
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,320
No, we can't craft.

1599
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,180
You guys never die forever.

1600
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,340
Nevermind.

1601
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,900
You're picking too hard.

1602
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,340
Guys, I thought too hard.

1603
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,320
We can play lifeline.

1604
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,120
Pick a lifeline.

1605
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,160
Yeah, we're picking a lifeline!

1606
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,580
Let's do it!

1607
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,400
I was actually gonna be like, oh my god, let's pick lifeline.

1608
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,020
Don't worry.

1609
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,400
Tempo likes me so he'll restart the game for me.

1610
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,180
Easy.

1611
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,320
It'll be easy.

1612
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,320
If I accidentally...

1613
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,680
Honestly, can he just tell us the zone?

1614
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,760
Cause he can see the zone.

1615
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,280
Oh, it's true!

1616
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,140
Let me message Tempo real quick.

1617
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,640
I'll tell him I'm never...

1618
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,660
Let me blackmail Tempo real quick.

1619
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,480
Alright, we're dropping.

1620
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,300
We might be contested.

1621
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,540
Oh.

1622
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,320
Woah!

1623
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,080
You told him to end right now?

1624
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,880
Yeah, I did!

1625
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,560
I told you!

1626
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
You had that much power.

1627
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,620
I have that much power!

1628
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,960
I told him to end the game.

1629
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,600
Look at that.

1630
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,000
He actually did it.

1631
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,620
I did this.

1632
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,320
Smile.

1633
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,700
I did this.

1634
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,040
In the presence of greatness.

1635
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,000
He knew...

1636
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,620
I have that much power.

1637
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,480
Do we have Hot Drop or no?

1638
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,900
Uh, I don't...

1639
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,620
Not that game.

1640
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,280
No, no, no, we didn't.

1641
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,140
Wait, apparently...

1642
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,480
Apparently Reps...

1643
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,080
Wait, was it Reps or...

1644
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,220
Oh, Verhulz!

1645
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,100
No, it was Verhulz.

1646
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,020
Yeah, Verhulz!

1647
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,980
It was on fucking Lifeline.

1648
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,660
Oh my god.

1649
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,320
That could've been us.

1650
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,200
Are we the only team that are playing...

1651
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,880
Why are there so many Caustics?

1652
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,360
Okay, people are playing Caustics.

1653
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,240
That makes me want to change my mind.

1654
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,640
Do we still want Conduit?

1655
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,600
Um...

1656
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,680
No, they're playing our comp.

1657
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,020
They're just swapping our wraith for a Caustic.

1658
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,000
Which, honestly, I would probably just ditch, dude.

1659
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,560
You're gonna conform?

1660
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,960
No, actually, no, you're right.

1661
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,720
You're gonna conform?

1662
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,720
Let those...

1663
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,020
You're right, you're right.

1664
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,720
We're gonna team with the wraith player.

1665
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,380
I know!

1666
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,400
I can't believe you're gonna be a Meta slave.

1667
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:56,940
That's what I'm saying.

1668
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,180
I can't believe it.

1669
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,960
What happened to you?

1670
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,380
You've changed.

1671
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,220
I almost changed, right there.

1672
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,620
Probably changed you.

1673
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,360
The peer pressure was actually pretty crazy.

1674
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,520
I know, probably changed you!

1675
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,220
You wouldn't let Meta help decide what you play.

1676
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,950
We're here to craft...

1677
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,490
We're here to theorycraft, not be the sheep.

1678
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:27,920
We're here to craft...

1679
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,580
They're with the wild cards.

1680
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,160
We're about to win this.

1681
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:29,580
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1682
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,780
Wild cards always win.

1683
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,240
That's why we're wild.

1684
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,320
Are you guys... Question, are you MNK or Roller?

1685
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,920
MNK.

1686
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,580
We're the MNK squad.

1687
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,280
We're so fucked.

1688
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,760
Wait, wait, we're fucked?

1689
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
What are you talking about?

1690
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,680
MNK is up.

1691
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, listen.

1692
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,220
Long range, long range fighting.

1693
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1694
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,560
Yeah, now we can actually use our guns, so it's fine.

1695
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,920
It's okay, I'll contact Destroyer2009.

1696
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,980
We can get some aim assist.

1697
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,520
Oh shit, you're right, you're right.

1698
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,500
Slip him a little 50 under the table.

1699
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:02,640
Mhm.

1700
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,440
Give us walls as well.

1701
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,240
With that extra 50.

1702
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,400
Alright, we're looking okay.

1703
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,340
We're looking good.

1704
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,720
Alright, you guys can land at the... over here.

1705
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,480
Probably stood off me.

1706
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,280
Yeah, I'm gonna loot over here.

1707
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm gonna go to the middle here.

1708
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,400
Yeah, just be careful, because when people die, they can always...

1709
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,720
they land on you.

1710
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,760
I think the closest thing is checkpoint maybe?

1711
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,800
I'll get that.

1712
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,820
I don't know how the respawns work, but there's a chance that people just don't know you're there, and then they just land on you.

1713
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,300
Yeah, I mean we just look up if they...

1714
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,340
Oh my god, someone already got knocked.

1715
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,620
Alright, I'll go on the right side.

1716
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,460
Oh my god, it's a trap.

1717
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,440
It feels weird grabbing guns.

1718
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,260
Feels like I'm doing something.

1719
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,000
It's not loud.

1720
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:46,940
Awww.

1721
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,180
We're running.

1722
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,420
Nemi R9.

1723
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,200
There's a Carbine here if anyone wants it.

1724
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,520
I'm alright.

1725
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,990
Do we need an Evo?

1726
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,090
There's an Evo here.

1727
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,470
We want to grab that.

1728
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:08,910
Yeah.

1729
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,010
We will grab that.

1730
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,690
Yeah, because we are...

1731
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:13,990
We're in our whiteys.

1732
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,070
We need marksman weapons.

1733
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,610
We'll have to grab them.

1734
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,490
The blue heavy mag.

1735
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,950
Ooh.

1736
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,280
Yeah.

1737
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,380
I'll loot the house in front.

1738
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,160
Wait, did you loot the...

1739
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,500
Oh, you looted the far right.

1740
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:33,940
Okay.

1741
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,160
I'm gonna loot the house.

1742
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,340
Wait, does the design died again?

1743
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,260
Is he 20?

1744
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,620
No, he's not 20 in place at least.

1745
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,440
No teams in white.

1746
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,180
There's a purple bag here.

1747
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,420
Oh, let's see.

1748
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,440
I haven't played Newcastle in a while.

1749
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,960
Should I get the swift shield or the thick shield?

1750
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,680
Can you read them to me?

1751
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,480
Mobile shield gains 250 HP.

1752
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,840
Increase mobile shield speed to weapon speed sprint.

1753
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,680
Probably the HP one.

1754
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,140
Alright.

1755
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,320
There's a blue bag here.

1756
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,380
Oh, we all have blue bags.

1757
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:15,760
We're fine.

1758
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,440
Fine.

1759
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,760
We're healthy.

1760
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,560
There's a purple mag.

1761
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:18,620
We're fine.

1762
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,300
Level 3.

1763
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,180
I'm gonna crack the bot.

1764
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,640
I'm cracking something.

1765
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,620
And then for your...

1766
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,940
Can you read me the other one as well?

1767
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,080
What's your level 2?

1768
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,120
Oh.

1769
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:39,520
My level 3 is 250 castle wall HP or allies are revived with health regen up to 75.

1770
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,820
The first one.

1771
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,880
Don't we already regen when you...

1772
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,340
Or does it regen on top of that too?

1773
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,440
No, no, no.

1774
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,560
It's just an instant HP.

1775
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,940
We res with 100 every single time.

1776
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,660
So there's no point in getting the second one.

1777
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,340
Oh yeah.

1778
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,400
Yeah.

1779
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,760
So the stronghold, right?

1780
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,420
The castle wall HP, right?

1781
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:03,660
Yeah, yeah.

1782
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,000
Because I read it out of order.

1783
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,240
So I was like, wait a minute.

1784
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,620
And then for your conduit one, can you read me your conduit abilities?

1785
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh, I do the 10% jammer and then I usually do the gain an extra tackle charge instead of the range.

1786
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,660
I'm trying to think.

1787
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,280
Yeah, that's about it.

1788
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,500
Right.

1789
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,620
I'm not too sure, honestly.

1790
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,040
I think that one's just good because it...

1791
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,060
Like you get it so often.

1792
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1793
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,700
So we should get the...

1794
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,620
We should grab the harvesters.

1795
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,500
Yeah.

1796
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:45,740
We should do the prowlers right now so we can get potentially close to purple.

1797
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,200
Alright, let's go.

1798
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,660
Alright, let's go.

1799
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,080
I'm here.

1800
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,040
Phew.

1801
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,380
Where's the other prowlers?

1802
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,340
Nobody's coming out.

1803
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:03,700
Shoot it.

1804
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
Oh, this one's so far away.

1805
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,020
Oh.

1806
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,560
Is the shooting the prowlers thing a myth or is it actually true?

1807
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,300
Wait a minute.

1808
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,920
Was that somebody landing?

1809
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,920
You back four?

1810
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,360
Shooting it does actually do something.

1811
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:16,840
Oh, okay.

1812
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,880
That's not a myth.

1813
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,260
It's real.

1814
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,200
After a certain amount of time, you shoot it and then...

1815
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,440
It's kinda just making noise.

1816
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,380
I knew it was real.

1817
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,460
No, it touched me.

1818
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,300
I dropped a 2x if anyone wants it.

1819
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,860
I am...

1820
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:34,980
7.

1821
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:37,920
Let's see.

1822
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,420
Actually, I'll probably take that.

1823
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,240
I mean...

1824
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,580
Is there any extra light ammo?

1825
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,360
I can drop your stuff.

1826
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:48,820
It's fine.

1827
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,320
I have like...

1828
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,640
I have 100 right now.

1829
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,040
Okay.

1830
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,600
I'm just curious.

1831
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,520
I have...

1832
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,340
I'll be

1833
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,020
fine.

1834
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,940
Shoot this down?

1835
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,800
This flyer that we're driving to?

1836
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,200
Yeah.

1837
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,340
It's almost dead.

1838
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,500
It's dead.

1839
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,320
Oh, it's purple.

1840
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,280
I'm gonna grab it.

1841
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:16,980
Yeah, yeah.

1842
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,380
Oh, Phoenix shit.

1843
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,040
Oh, do you grab the... you got?

1844
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,440
I did.

1845
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:23,680
Yeah, I did.

1846
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,120
Oh, wait.

1847
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:24,860
I grabbed it.

1848
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,040
I grabbed it.

1849
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,120
Sorry, I'm bad at driving.

1850
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,840
That's why our pro player will drive for us.

1851
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,940
Yes, yes.

1852
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,060
I got you.

1853
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,360
Can you grab this?

1854
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,200
Yeah, I'll grab it.

1855
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:36,700
Okay.

1856
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,520
Um...

1857
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,000
We are gonna grab this one.

1858
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,540
And then we craft the medkit there.

1859
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,120
Alright.

1860
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,180
Wait, there's people here.

1861
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,480
No, no.

1862
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:47,820
It's just...

1863
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,740
The zone... Oh, the zone drops them?

1864
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,720
Yeah, yeah.

1865
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,820
The zone hits...

1866
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,900
Oh, this guy is here though.

1867
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,400
Damn!

1868
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,880
We fight them, fight them, fight them.

1869
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,740
Okay, okay, okay.

1870
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:58,940
I got one, I got one.

1871
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,340
I'm going in.

1872
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,260
Boom!

1873
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,020
Okay, I'm right behind them.

1874
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:03,800
Watson, Watson low.

1875
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:05,860
Nice.

1876
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,300
Let's go.

1877
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,940
Okay, look at us.

1878
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,460
Wait, I'm looking up just in case.

1879
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,960
Just in case.

1880
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,860
They're gonna come back.

1881
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,600
They're angry.

1882
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,780
They're so angry.

1883
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,940
I'm looking up.

1884
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,380
No, they're not.

1885
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:19,700
They're not.

1886
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,100
They don't wanna fly in the zone.

1887
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,780
They're way too stupid for that.

1888
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:23,960
Okay.

1889
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,580
They don't want the...

1890
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,280
They don't want the smoke.

1891
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,460
Yeah, yeah.

1892
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,800
I got two medkits for you guys.

1893
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,060
Any of you guys need batteries?

1894
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:29,800
I got bat.

1895
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,680
I craft a bat too.

1896
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,180
I should be good.

1897
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:32,760
Good.

1898
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,680
I'm just gonna grab an extra bat just in case.

1899
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,580
Oh my god, so many bats.

1900
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,440
Oh my god.

1901
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,020
Can someone hold...

1902
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,340
Can someone hold this?

1903
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,620
I have an issue.

1904
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,160
The other one?

1905
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,340
I'm holding one already.

1906
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:45,500
Okay.

1907
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,100
Hold the what?

1908
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,620
Could actually someone swap me...

1909
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,520
a purple bag?

1910
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,280
Wait, I can hold this actually.

1911
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,120
I can hold it.

1912
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,200
I have a purple bag.

1913
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,680
Yeah, can someone swap me?

1914
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,820
Cause I'll probably be looting a lot of the boxes for us.

1915
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,680
I don't know how to efficiently swap so everything's just gonna spill out.

1916
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,680
I don't know how to efficiently swap so everything's just gonna spill out.

1917
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:03,920
Yeah, yeah.

1918
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,600
That's fine.

1919
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,420
Good.

1920
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,560
I'm gonna make another medkit for us.

1921
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,380
Yay!

1922
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:09,980
Okay.

1923
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,940
You can get into the car.

1924
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,660
Alright.

1925
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,180
Just gonna...

1926
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,340
make sure... I have everything I need.

1927
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:19,520
Alright.

1928
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,000
Let's go.

1929
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,200
Oh wait, wait.

1930
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,120
I'm fucking driving the car.

1931
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,840
I can.

1932
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:23,840
I can.

1933
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:25,940
Woah!

1934
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,340
Woah!

1935
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,560
What happened Spoons?

1936
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,060
It's okay.

1937
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,420
I guess it was better that I died.

1938
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,180
We can die to zone by the way.

1939
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:35,480
Yeah.

1940
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,340
Yeah, yeah.

1941
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:36,680
I forgot.

1942
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,920
Wait, how many seconds do we have in zones again?

1943
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,860
Wait, how many seconds do we have in zones again?

1944
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,820
Uh, five minutes.

1945
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,080
Five minutes?

1946
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,520
Oh yeah, cause I remember someone probably died from zone.

1947
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,240
Five minutes?

1948
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:46,680
Oh yeah, cause I remember someone probably died from zone.

1949
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:47,700
Cool.

1950
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,300
What a noob.

1951
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,760
Was it your team?

1952
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,060
It was a DSG.

1953
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:54,660
It was a DSG.

1954
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,840
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

1955
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,460
Wait, hold up.

1956
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,880
I'm gonna die to zone real quick.

1957
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,140
So I can get a medkit.

1958
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,860
Oh, I see.

1959
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,120
I see.

1960
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,720
I see the vision.

1961
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,180
That's smart.

1962
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,700
Okay, don't worry.

1963
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,480
Anytime now.

1964
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,320
Yep.

1965
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:09,920
Mm-hmm.

1966
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,360
For sure.

1967
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,500
I'm getting a little scared.

1968
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,020
Okay.

1969
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,580
There you go.

1970
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,840
I was also seeing the res timer.

1971
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:17,900
Okay.

1972
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,060
Okay.

1973
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,880
We'll go here.

1974
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:21,880
Alright.

1975
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,600
Yay.

1976
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,420
There's a lot of people.

1977
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:33,960
Whoa.

1978
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,220
There's a team over there.

1979
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,300
What the fuck?

1980
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,920
I was gonna say how I fell down.

1981
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,280
I'm gonna grab the armor here.

1982
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,000
Got it?

1983
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:45,960
Yep.

1984
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,800
Perfect.

1985
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:48,980
Let's go up here.

1986
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,600
Alright.

1987
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:49,720
Damn it.

1988
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,860
Just a nice scenic ride.

1989
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,280
I hope we get out of the door.

1990
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,560
So great.

1991
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,080
So 20 teams.

1992
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,400
Oh, oh, oh.

1993
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:58,840
Oh, no.

1994
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,940
I am stuck in the car.

1995
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,760
I am...

1996
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,440
What is going on?

1997
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,220
Oh my god.

1998
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,580
Just run.

1999
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,100
Just run.

2000
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,780
We can res.

2001
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,080
We can res.

2002
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:12,920
Yeah, I res.

2003
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,220
I res.

2004
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:13,520
I res.

2005
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,240
But I got hit.

2006
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,800
I got hit.

2007
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,960
I got hit.

2008
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:16,720
I got hit.

2009
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,260
Yeah.

2010
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,160
Tiffy.

2011
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,780
Hold your knock.

2012
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,120
Hold your knock.

2013
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,760
Molly, I'm holding a Sykes.

2014
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,080
Oh.

2015
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,300
They came out of nowhere.

2016
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,240
I got stuck in that car in the horizon.

2017
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,700
They were ratting it.

2018
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,100
They were ratting it.

2019
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,620
I can't believe it.

2020
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,100
We can land on the creeper.

2021
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,900
It's okay.

2022
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,240
We have all our stuff.

2023
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,000
But they're also super stacked now.

2024
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:40,700
Okay.

2025
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,580
Maybe not on the creeper.

2026
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,100
So I'll just look in.

2027
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,220
Let's land.

2028
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,160
Our perfect rotate.

2029
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:47,980
Hahaha.

2030
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,020
Yeah.

2031
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,020
Yeah, we died on purpose so we can get a spot, right?

2032
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:53,880
Yeah.

2033
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,020
Yeah.

2034
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,400
This may not be the right spot to go, but we'll go here.

2035
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,180
There's a team right here.

2036
00:58:59,420 --> 00:58:59,760
Yeah.

2037
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,520
I landed at the bottom.

2038
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:01,780
Whoops.

2039
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,080
Okay.

2040
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:03,940
That's fine.

2041
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,020
I'm safe here, I think.

2042
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:06,440
Yep.

2043
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:06,780
Um.

2044
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,000
Um.

2045
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,460
Are you guys safe up there, though?

2046
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,500
Um.

2047
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,260
I think we're gonna drop down.

2048
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:11,760
Drop down.

2049
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,040
Drop down.

2050
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,320
Drop down.

2051
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,660
Yeah.

2052
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:14,860
Let's go in here.

2053
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,340
Play in here.

2054
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,640
I'm fine.

2055
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,380
I have ult in 50.

2056
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,500
Yep.

2057
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,380
Here's an extra med kit.

2058
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,120
There's a phoenix kit right here.

2059
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,060
If anyone wants it.

2060
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,240
You okay?

2061
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:29,880
Um.

2062
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,420
It actually pulled across.

2063
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,000
So let's follow me.

2064
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:33,800
Okay.

2065
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,360
We're gonna pray that this team does not hold us out.

2066
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,160
We're gonna pray that this team does not hold us out.

2067
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,900
But they have blue armor.

2068
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,720
Wait.

2069
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:52,740
Yeah.

2070
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,340
We're gonna play.

2071
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:53,600
We're gonna.

2072
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:53,940
Yeah.

2073
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,320
We're gonna play.

2074
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:54,660
Oh.

2075
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:54,660
51.

2076
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,140
One has purple.

2077
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,540
We're gonna play out here.

2078
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,980
I'm looking behind us just in case.

2079
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:06,780
I don't see anybody behind that team.

2080
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,920
Yeah.

2081
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,680
We're gonna fight at this building.

2082
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:13,740
Alright.

2083
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,740
I have ult here too.

2084
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:16,820
We can hide.

2085
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,280
There's another team going northwest.

2086
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,840
And they're gonna fight them first.

2087
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,260
Okay.

2088
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:21,660
Let me just wait.

2089
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,600
That's good.

2090
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:22,880
Alright.

2091
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,280
So we just hide.

2092
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,180
We don't make presence.

2093
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,140
Yeah.

2094
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:26,300
Yeah.

2095
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:26,480
Yeah.

2096
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,920
I'll take this rock so you can't get us all.

2097
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:29,600
Yeah.

2098
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,340
I have ult too.

2099
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,080
We need it.

2100
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,080
I'll have ADE too right now.

2101
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,300
Ooh.

2102
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,200
This is a...

2103
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,300
cannon ending.

2104
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,640
Especially probably over here.

2105
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,120
Wait.

2106
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:44,640
I have evac.

2107
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,180
Do we ever need to use it?

2108
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:47,660
Yeah.

2109
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:47,860
Yeah.

2110
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:47,900
Yeah.

2111
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,460
We're gonna pretty much go for these buildings and then we'll evac over.

2112
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,520
Okay.

2113
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,080
My guy is still 20 swats.

2114
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,560
Oh no.

2115
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,000
And Zona's gonna be hell.

2116
01:00:59,360 --> 01:00:59,880
Alright.

2117
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,160
Follow me.

2118
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,780
Alright.

2119
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,880
Behind you.

2120
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,180
Don't shoot him.

2121
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:04,560
Don't shoot him.

2122
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:05,620
Okay.

2123
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:06,880
Keep walking.

2124
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,480
Hug the wall.

2125
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,500
Low walk up.

2126
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,520
Yeah.

2127
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:16,800
Over here.

2128
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,360
I think they might have saw us but keep low.

2129
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,620
Okay.

2130
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,600
We're little rats.

2131
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:23,500
Yeah.

2132
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:23,720
Yeah.

2133
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,060
Yeah.

2134
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,220
Yeah.

2135
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:24,680
Rats.

2136
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,380
Rats.

2137
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,360
Okay.

2138
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,040
Walk up.

2139
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,160
I'm here.

2140
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,760
We are hard to chill in here.

2141
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,220
We're gonna sit right here.

2142
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:38,900
We're gonna sit right here.

2143
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:41,440
Perfect.

2144
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,860
Perfect.

2145
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:42,260
Perfect.

2146
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,940
No one will ever know.

2147
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,340
No one will ever know.

2148
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:46,020
Oh nice.

2149
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,720
Careful of the window behind you.

2150
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,040
Just hide in the corner.

2151
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:50,940
Hello.

2152
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,680
I'm here.

2153
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Perfect.

2154
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:53,840
Perfect.

2155
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,740
How far are you guys from your red?

2156
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,880
I had 759.

2157
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:00,960
Okay.

2158
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:02,660
Oh my god.

2159
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,300
A squad full died.

2160
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,120
I think we climb up.

2161
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,020
We're not 20th.

2162
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:06,620
Yeah.

2163
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:06,880
They're fighting.

2164
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,220
They're fighting.

2165
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,220
We can look for this.

2166
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:09,140
Okay.

2167
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,320
Did they die?

2168
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,560
Over here I see them.

2169
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:15,780
Yeah.

2170
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,860
They might have died.

2171
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,440
Ring close in one minute.

2172
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:18,960
I'm gonna see.

2173
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,100
He's shooting.

2174
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,240
He's looking back at us.

2175
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,740
Does he know?

2176
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,960
Does he know our existence?

2177
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,940
I don't think he knows.

2178
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,840
I don't think he knows.

2179
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:30,640
I don't think he knows.

2180
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,060
We're pretty much gonna follow behind them.

2181
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:34,640
We're pretty much gonna follow behind them.

2182
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:34,640
Okay.

2183
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,140
Alright.

2184
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,920
And they cleared the way for us.

2185
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:39,940
Yeah.

2186
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,720
Should be fine.

2187
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,180
I'm just gonna hide.

2188
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,080
Nothing to worry about.

2189
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,020
Oh yeah.

2190
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:46,840
We'll be fine.

2191
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,580
We'll be hard chilling.

2192
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,480
We'll be so chill.

2193
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:48,920
Yeah.

2194
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,540
We're gonna turn around.

2195
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,880
This guy's looting the box until there's like literally nothing in it.

2196
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,300
Yeah.

2197
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,880
What is he gonna do?

2198
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,040
Just stay there forever?

2199
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,880
Until the zone kills him?

2200
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,380
Don't turn around.

2201
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,140
Okay.

2202
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,720
Follow my pathing.

2203
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,980
Try not to hit the traps.

2204
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,020
I'm okay.

2205
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,300
I'm gonna go and leave.

2206
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,960
I'm gonna go and change the right here a little bit.

2207
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,840
You ready to 3-2-1 this person in front of us?

2208
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,400
Yeah.

2209
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,400
They're right here.

2210
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:21,900
Ready?

2211
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,760
3-2-1.

2212
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:23,160
Go.

2213
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,360
Got him.

2214
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:26,960
Plastic.

2215
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,340
Nice.

2216
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,460
Really good job.

2217
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:28,980
Yep.

2218
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:29,800
They're right here.

2219
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,160
On me.

2220
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:30,780
Okay.

2221
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:31,260
Yeah.

2222
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,480
There's a team with a Newcastle wall.

2223
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,120
I have ult too.

2224
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:34,860
We need to use it.

2225
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,340
Newcastle right in the zone right here.

2226
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:37,700
At this rock.

2227
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,300
Okay.

2228
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:38,920
I'm doing it.

2229
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:39,940
Nice.

2230
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,760
And then we play the wall.

2231
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:42,420
Okay.

2232
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:42,840
Okay.

2233
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,300
One of us.

2234
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,220
They all died.

2235
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:46,580
I think.

2236
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:47,820
No.

2237
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,180
No.

2238
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:48,380
No.

2239
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,100
Stay there.

2240
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,240
Stay there.

2241
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,680
Watch out.

2242
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:53,860
Right?

2243
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,340
Wait.

2244
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:54,860
They did all die.

2245
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,060
Oh.

2246
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:55,380
They all died?

2247
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,200
Do we take that spot?

2248
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,000
No.

2249
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:57,360
You stay there.

2250
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,260
Watch the right side.

2251
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:01,280
They're rotating.

2252
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:01,980
Blue armor.

2253
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:02,500
Blue armor.

2254
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,280
Blue armor on the C.

2255
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:10,590
You can't be coordinated forever.

2256
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:12,410
Also purple.

2257
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:15,370
I'm gonna need energy ammo.

2258
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:16,650
Is there any energy ammo over there?

2259
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:17,690
To me?

2260
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:18,590
Yes.

2261
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,090
There is.

2262
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,390
Okay.

2263
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,750
Jarek.

2264
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,570
Come to you or you taxi it over.

2265
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,290
You will come to me in a second.

2266
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,450
I'm gonna make sure that...

2267
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:26,810
Oh.

2268
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:26,970
Okay.

2269
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:27,790
Team right up here too.

2270
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,210
I'm going in.

2271
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,910
I'm going in.

2272
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,490
I'm going in.

2273
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:30,690
Yeah.

2274
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:30,770
Yeah.

2275
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,550
They didn't come over here.

2276
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:33,430
Nice.

2277
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:34,910
Oh.

2278
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,090
Nice.

2279
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,850
Might be on us.

2280
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,690
We'll be okay.

2281
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:41,050
We have this... Right here.

2282
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:41,250
Right here.

2283
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:42,710
Start shooting.

2284
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,050
Start shooting so you guys can get red.

2285
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,910
Yeah.

2286
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:44,970
Yeah.

2287
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:45,110
Yeah.

2288
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:45,570
Okay.

2289
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:46,910
Oh my god.

2290
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:47,310
I got stuck.

2291
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,030
Bro.

2292
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:48,870
I'm missing my scout shots.

2293
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,030
I'm just gonna grab some C if there's any other loot for me.

2294
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,370
Okay.

2295
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:53,630
Got red.

2296
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:55,330
Nice.

2297
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,850
Nice.

2298
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,530
We're gonna rotate here.

2299
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:00,290
We're gonna rotate here really slow.

2300
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:01,230
Okay.

2301
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:01,790
I'm working.

2302
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,450
I am like... I'm 100 away from red.

2303
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,490
But I don't have anybody to shoot at right now.

2304
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,350
Okay.

2305
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:09,570
Cool.

2306
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:13,070
You're behind this rock.

2307
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:13,330
Oh.

2308
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,210
This team here too.

2309
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:18,760
Oh.

2310
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,700
Let me shoot you.

2311
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:20,240
Oh.

2312
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:20,240
Let me shoot you.

2313
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:22,880
Oh.

2314
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Let me shoot you.

2315
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:22,900
Oh.

2316
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,500
I need to grab some light ammo and walk over to you guys.

2317
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:24,700
Yeah.

2318
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:24,820
Yeah.

2319
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,400
There's a lot of light.

2320
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,920
I don't think there's light.

2321
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,720
You're gonna have to...

2322
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,360
There is.

2323
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:28,360
There is.

2324
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:28,700
Here, here, here.

2325
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,500
There is.

2326
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,840
There's armors up in the back if you wanna grab the armor.

2327
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,000
Thank you.

2328
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,280
I'm 3% off from...

2329
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,220
I'm 3% off from...

2330
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,160
Oh shit, turn right, right.

2331
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,340
Can you come here?

2332
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,020
Yeah, let me know if I need to ult, conduit, ult, anything.

2333
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,160
Yeah, can you conduit ult this up here?

2334
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,180
We're gonna take the zip and go up.

2335
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,300
Yep, nice.

2336
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,740
Should I cross the gap?

2337
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,400
Take the zip, take the zip, take the zip.

2338
01:05:59,220 --> 01:05:59,860
Okay, okay, okay.

2339
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,460
I'm taking it.

2340
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,660
And then you're gonna ult right here, underneath the stairs.

2341
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:04,100
Alright.

2342
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:04,380
Woo!

2343
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:04,880
Right underneath.

2344
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,360
Yeah, right here is good.

2345
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,080
Yeah, perfect.

2346
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:09,660
Perfect.

2347
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,200
Someone's taking damage red on top of us.

2348
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,260
They have a caustic, they have a caustic.

2349
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,040
We have to shoot the traps.

2350
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,760
We can also play in here.

2351
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,140
I nearly need like 45 left.

2352
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,140
I nearly need like 45 left.

2353
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:25,440
No, it was a mirage clone.

2354
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,760
We can also play right here.

2355
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:30,180
I got red, I got red.

2356
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,740
Wait, wait, what the fuck?

2357
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,420
The windows can see you.

2358
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,980
Yeah, I got red.

2359
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:37,340
I don't need to ult.

2360
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:37,760
I'm not gonna worry now.

2361
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:38,580
Nice.

2362
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,220
20 seconds on my ult.

2363
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,620
I mean, no, my shield.

2364
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,820
Come to me, come to me, come to me.

2365
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,020
Come to my side, my side, my side.

2366
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,480
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

2367
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,480
I'm getting ticked by caustic ult.

2368
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,360
Yeah, I'm dead.

2369
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,700
I can just crawl up to you.

2370
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,780
There's a prison here, prison here.

2371
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,620
Just try to beat me off of the...

2372
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,600
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

2373
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,120
I'm watching.

2374
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,920
Yeah, yeah, come back up.

2375
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:04,320
Come back up.

2376
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,320
We're super safe.

2377
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,200
Alright, here you go.

2378
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:11,880
You have your ult back?

2379
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:12,860
Here, get your ult back.

2380
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,460
52.

2381
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:14,560
Alright.

2382
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,280
Uh-oh.

2383
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,040
Whoa, it's final zone.

2384
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,120
I have another ult, excel too, if anyone wants it.

2385
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,260
I can take, or do you have portal?

2386
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,820
Yeah, I do have portal.

2387
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,640
Okay, I'm popping it's ult, so...

2388
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,700
Okay, what you're gonna do...

2389
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,620

2390
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,640
What you're gonna do is you need to ult, okay?

2391
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,960
You're gonna ult right here.

2392
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,040
Where do I face?

2393
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,260
Like, do I face this direction?

2394
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,220
Do I face west?

2395
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,040
No, no, no.

2396
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,480
So ult right here, and then face towards the building.

2397
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,300
Towards the building?

2398
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:48,780
Okay, okay.

2399
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,120
The building to our right, yeah.

2400
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,580
So you're gonna ult right here.

2401
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,820
Actually, let me ping you a little bit better.

2402
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,460
More right here.

2403
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,360
Right there is the winning spot.

2404
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,820
So you can stay where I'm standing, and you ult right here.

2405
01:07:58,860 --> 01:07:59,700
And then I face the building.

2406
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,640
The barrier faces the building.

2407
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:01,820
Okay.

2408
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,980
Do you want me to take portal with you right away?

2409
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2410
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:07,660
Right here.

2411
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,380
That's where you're gonna...

2412
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,920
And then when you ult, please send your shield as well after your Q.

2413
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,640
I'll ping it again for you so you know exactly where.

2414
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,100
I feel like I'm gonna accidentally go into the portal.

2415
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:20,940
No, no, no.

2416
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:21,200
You're good.

2417
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:21,440
You're good.

2418
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,720
Just stand on this, and then if you need to jump off, you'll be fine.

2419
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:26,280
Okay.

2420
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,320
Alright, I'm going now.

2421
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,440
Okay.

2422
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,260
Ult right here.

2423
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:31,960
Where I'm standing.

2424
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,000
Ult right where I am.

2425
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:33,640
Okay, ready?

2426
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:34,560
Yep.

2427
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,140
Right now, right now.

2428
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,100
And then turn for the big thing.

2429
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,040
Perfect, perfect.

2430
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:39,400
Nice.

2431
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,460
Put your Q, put your Q.

2432
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,420
Should I ult?

2433
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,220
Put your Q down, put your Q down.

2434
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,560
Oh god, our armor thing is gone.

2435
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:44,880
No!

2436
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:45,920
I got it, I got you.

2437
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:46,120
That's okay.

2438
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,600
Put your Q down, put your Q down.

2439
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,000
Put your shield.

2440
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:50,540
Thank you.

2441
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,240
Yep.

2442
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,800
Put your shield, put your shield, shield, shield, shield.

2443
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,440
Put your Q, put your Q, put your Q.

2444
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2445
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,060
I have to go up, I have to go up.

2446
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,240
I couldn't.

2447
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:00,960
I had to go up.

2448
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,440
Oh my god.

2449
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,820
I'm gonna try to break the caustic traps.

2450
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:09,980
Oh no.

2451
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,080
Holy shit.

2452
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,500
Dang, they broke my caustic...

2453
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,000
I mean... Oh my god, we got Fizz.

2454
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,260
We got Fizz, let's go.

2455
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,080
Oh, you said my shield.

2456
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,480
Okay, when you said shield, I thought you meant conduit shield.

2457
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,880
That's why I got so confused.

2458
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2459
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,280
I'm sorry.

2460
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:28,920
No, it's okay, it's okay.

2461
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,420
I was like, I was like, Spooze, why aren't you putting...

2462
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,720
Why aren't you giving us the Q?

2463
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:37,180
Yeah, yeah, honestly, I could've ported us in the spot that I went to.

2464
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,020
But I feel like we might have died there.

2465
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,660
I think our spot was maybe better.

2466
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,020
Yeah.

2467
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,680
Yeah, I think that was a good spot.

2468
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:44,720
Yeah, that was a good spot.

2469
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,060
Yeah.

2470
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,700
That was hard.

2471
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,920
I was like, shield?

2472
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,320
You mean conduit shield?

2473
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2474
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,960
That was a Q, and then I was like shield, and I was like, hmm, it's still not coming down.

2475
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,080
I know, you meant I didn't say anything.

2476
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:02,140
Yeah, I was just like, when's the conduit shield?

2477
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,860
That was good, we got fifth.

2478
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,660
We got fifth, that's really good.

2479
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,720
We also got five kills.

2480
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,600
Yeah, kills don't matter though.

2481
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,060
Yeah, kills don't matter though.

2482
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,560
I think we should get a hundred for every kill.

2483
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,080
Kill matters in our hearts.

2484
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,680
Oh, it's duo's time.

2485
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,680
Next round.

2486
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,720
Oh, it's duo's time.

2487
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:30,720
Next round.

2488
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,220
That's like $400, right?

2489
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:33,700
Still?

2490
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,440
I don't even remember how the prize ratings are done.

2491
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,060
Um...

2492
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,280
Whoa!

2493
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,940
Wait, a thousand to a hundred?

2494
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,340
Wait, do each of us get a thousand to a hundred?

2495
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,900
It's split between three.

2496
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:45,820
Oh!

2497
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,360
Okay, I was gonna say ten.

2498
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:47,900
That's the total.

2499
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,300
400 bones.

2500
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,060
Nice.

2501
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,660
We're so close to 500.

2502
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,700
God damn it, how?

2503
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:03,700
God damn it, how?

2504
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,300
This guy just can't let us win content creator tourneys either.

2505
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:07,300
All good.

2506
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,040
It's just greedy.

2507
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,240
I know, right?

2508
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,080
God damn.

2509
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,560
Stop joining tourney.

2510
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,180
You have enough money.

2511
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:20,500
Alright, GG's guys.

2512
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:21,800
GG's.

2513
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,160
Good luck in your next game.

2514
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:25,100
GG!

2515
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:25,900
Likewise, thanks for playing.

2516
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:27,140
Bye bye.

2517
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,220
Bye bye.

2518
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,840
Alright, there's no team 22 voice chat so I'm waiting.

2519
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,020
I can't believe the shield was me.

2520
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,320
I was so confused.

2521
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:38,980
I was just like, what do you mean?

2522
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,820
I was just like...

2523
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,820
I was just like, where's the conduit shield?

2524
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,220
Where's the conduit...

2525
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,740
I was like, don't worry guys.

2526
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,600
I'm here.

2527
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,600
I'm here.

2528
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,900
I didn't realize it was...

2529
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,580
I didn't realize it was my shield.

2530
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:10,180
I got confused because conduit also uses shield.

2531
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,940
I don't have a shield.

2532
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,760
It's just a tomato brain moment.

2533
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,880
I was like, here we go.

2534
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,560
Don't worry, I'm here.

2535
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,380
I was like, yeah, I got my ult down!

2536
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,580
And then I was like, alright, I did my job.

2537
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,740
The shields, what do they mean?

2538
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,720
The shields!

2539
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,760
What do the shields mean?

2540
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,600
That's my streamer.

2541
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,940
That's my streamer.

2542
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,880
That's me!

2543
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,700
I'm so fucking smart.

2544
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,820
Alright, I need to look, read it up.

2545
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,960
Read up the thing.

2546
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:07,980
What do we need?

2547
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:08,880
Oh, we got a new code.

2548
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:09,500
Okay.

2549
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,960
New code time.

2550
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,280
New code.

2551
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:14,780
My duo is dropped, by the way.

2552
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,280
Drop will be my duo.

2553
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,400
Uh... which one you two?

2554
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,440
Oh, there it is.

2555
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,040
Um...

2556
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,440
That's my duo.

2557
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,580
I'm gonna see if there's like any specific rules.

2558
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,360
That...

2559
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,180
It always... It's like a circle!

2560
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,900
It's a circle!

2561
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,680
Oh my god, he can IGL!

2562
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,640
That's true!

2563
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,900
I'm already a step up!

2564
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,080
It comes full circle.

2565
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,470
Alright, let's see.

2566
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:49,210
There's no additional...

2567
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:50,590
Oh, Gibby Caustic only!

2568
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:51,610
Okay.

2569
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:52,690
Okay.

2570
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:53,830
That's fine.

2571
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:54,830
We can make this work.

2572
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,310
There's only Gibby and Caustic.

2573
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,030
It's not a circle, it's a spiral.

2574
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:00,930
That's funny.

2575
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,610
I can't believe I thought it was a Karnian cube.

2576
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,030
I can't believe it.

2577
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,670
I was just like, where is my cube?

2578
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,350
Where is it?

2579
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,490
What do you mean?

2580
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,490
I was like, God damn it, Spoons!

2581
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,670
Where the fuck is my Karnian cube?

2582
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,430
It's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life.

2583
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:31,950
Hey, I still got top 5!

2584
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,490
I still got top 5.

2585
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,530
It's still something.

2586
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:35,670
Chat.

2587
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,370
We still...

2588
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,370
Cube is in our heart.

2589
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:47,530
No!

2590
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,230
The thing is Karnian also does shields!

2591
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,310
That's why I got confused!

2592
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:53,470
I thought...

2593
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:55,130
I was like, that's a weird plan.

2594
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,790
That's a weird plan.

2595
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:59,450
Put down my ult and then a Karnian cube?

2596
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:00,450
I was like, that's weird.

2597
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:01,650
Cuz he's like, Q Q Q.

2598
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:02,490
I was like, Karnian cube?

2599
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,430
Everything was...

2600
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,890
in the heat of the moment.

2601
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:17,090
He never said which cube.

2602
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,410
Yeah, that's true.

2603
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,850
Look, I need my hand to be held for IGLing, okay?

2604
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:29,550
Like, they have to be very fucking specific or I would be very fucking confused for the rest of my time.

2605
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:35,730
Like, I need people to be extremely specific in what they mean.

2606
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,150
That's why.

2607
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,810
Okay guys, it's not my fault.

2608
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:41,350
Chat.

2609
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,690
It's not my fault.

2610
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,870
They have to be incredibly specific.

2611
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:53,470
People need to like... people need to make sure they illiterate...

2612
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,190
uh... what was it?

2613
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:56,450
They have... I'm illiterate, but so...

2614
01:15:56,450 --> 01:16:02,230
People need to be very, very specific.

2615
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:09,230
Alright, we're just waiting for it.

2616
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,770
We're just waiting for it dropped and then we should be good to go.

2617
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:16,350
We're waiting for it dropped to join in.

2618
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:19,410
It's...

2619
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,110
Yeah, yeah.

2620
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,610
My streamer moment.

2621
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:24,910
Look guys, I'm the content creator here, okay?

2622
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:32,970
You can't assume that my brain would be fine tuned the same way as all the other actual Apex players.

2623
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,130
I'm a content creator.

2624
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:36,630
This is my duo.

2625
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:37,690
Dropped.

2626
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:40,310
That's him.

2627
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,630
So like, it's not my fault.

2628
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:48,310
The content creator debuffed chat.

2629
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:57,750
It was sadly the content creator debuff.

2630
01:16:58,270 --> 01:16:58,950
It's a...

2631
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,450
Yeah, these are really stacked players.

2632
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,450
Yeah.

2633
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,850
I mean, the first game we got Jen.

2634
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,550
Second game we got Timmy.

2635
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,110
Third game we got dropped.

2636
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,690
That's actually really lucky for us.

2637
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,670
Wait, he's not here.

2638
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:12,730
Wait, what do I play?

2639
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:14,530
He's not...

2640
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,310
He's not even in voice chat!

2641
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,050
What do I play?

2642
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:21,230
I don't know!

2643
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:22,430
We're starting!

2644
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:31,970
He's AFK?

2645
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:33,490
Wait, he plays Gibby.

2646
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:34,590
He's known for Gibby, right?

2647
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,770
He's known for Gibby, right?

2648
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:37,830
I'm Kosti.

2649
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:38,310
Yo, what do you wanna play?

2650
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:38,970
Oh shit!

2651
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:39,390
Okay!

2652
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:40,930
Kosti, we're here!

2653
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:41,430
Okay.

2654
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:41,890
Alright.

2655
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:44,730
Where the fuck were you?

2656
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:45,970
We didn't even strategize!

2657
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,290
I was grabbing food.

2658
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,370
I had to grab food.

2659
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,030
You grabbed food?

2660
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,030
Was it worth it?

2661
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:52,970
Yeah.

2662
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:54,090
What was it worth to get?

2663
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:54,830
I have an 8.

2664
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:56,390
What did you get though?

2665
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,770
I got chicken and rice.

2666
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:58,650
You got chicken...

2667
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:00,150
That's what you ditched?

2668
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:02,410
Chicken and rice?

2669
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,170
Mmhmm.

2670
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:06,990
That's like the most plain ass shit ever!

2671
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:12,050
You ditched a very important tournament by the way.

2672
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:19,150
This has more money than Pro League and you ditched that for chicken and rice?

2673
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,030
Wait, what is our drop spot?

2674
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,210
Launch site.

2675
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,990
Okay.

2676
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:24,650
Technically you're not wrong.

2677
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:25,630
It does have more money than Pro League.

2678
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:25,910
Yeah!

2679
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:26,950
I was gonna say!

2680
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:31,030
Alright, let me raise your volume up a little bit.

2681
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:34,190
So like, what's the strat here?

2682
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:38,410
I don't know.

2683
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:41,930
I mean, I'm just gonna play it how we like how a normal game does.

2684
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,390
I don't think it's gonna be any different.

2685
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:44,510
It's not gonna be any different?

2686
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:44,750
Alright.

2687
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,850
We might have a team that wants to come to us.

2688
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:47,070
Oh, we're getting conned?

2689
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:48,550
Maybe, yeah.

2690
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,430
We're just gonna land here.

2691
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:51,310
Okay.

2692
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,530
If a team lands here try and like push out here and kill them.

2693
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,750
Okay, no problem.

2694
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,290
I don't know if anybody landed near us.

2695
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:03,910
I don't see anyone.

2696
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:05,150
I think we're good.

2697
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:05,650
We're good?

2698
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:06,010
Nice.

2699
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,850
Nothing ever goes wrong for us.

2700
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:10,410
It's off to a good start.

2701
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,790
There's a hemlock there next to that if you need.

2702
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,910
Uh, yeah.

2703
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,090
I dropped a Havoc.

2704
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,890
I heard Havoc is good this season.

2705
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,230
Wait, zipping up towards the south.

2706
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:23,770
What the fuck?

2707
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:24,930
What are you doing there?

2708
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:25,290
Leave!

2709
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:26,790
So there is a team.

2710
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:27,410
Alright, so go.

2711
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:28,990
It might start peeking out of the glass.

2712
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,150
Alright, I'm gonna go right.

2713
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,130
Move right and steal all this loot.

2714
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:32,670
Alright.

2715
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,810
These guys are gonna have like literally nothing.

2716
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:38,770
If you see a shotgun, let me know.

2717
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,050
Like a Mastiff would be huge.

2718
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:41,190
Alright, alright, alright.

2719
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:44,810
And we got an Evo Harvester here.

2720
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:45,930
We're gonna have Blues.

2721
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:47,390
We can literally roll these guys.

2722
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:52,710
I have an Ulti I can use that right now.

2723
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:56,710
Do I want the throw?

2724
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:57,910
Oh, here's a PK.

2725
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:02,190
Do I want the throw range or the residual toxins?

2726
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:04,930
The vision.

2727
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:05,670
The vision?

2728
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:06,170
Okay.

2729
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,130
Oh, there's a Mastiff.

2730
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,290
Nice.

2731
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:10,830
I'm gonna drop PK.

2732
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:13,690
Oh, and that?

2733
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:14,710
I'm juiced.

2734
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:16,910
You need bats?

2735
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:18,250
I have three bats.

2736
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,190
I got two.

2737
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:21,110
Oh no, I didn't see him.

2738
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:22,450
They're pushing.

2739
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,160
I cracked him.

2740
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,120
I cracked Nibby.

2741
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,320
No, I dropped behind you.

2742
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:35,760
No, I didn't see him.

2743
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:36,780
Sorry.

2744
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,400
I'm so sorry.

2745
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,340
Dang, that sucked.

2746
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:44,000
That sucked.

2747
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,620
So was it worth it?

2748
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,760
Food to chicken or rice?

2749
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,840
Was it...

2750
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,140
Was the chicken or rice worth it?

2751
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:53,460
Was the chicken or rice worth it?

2752
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,080
What is it?

2753
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,540
Oh man.

2754
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,480
I can't believe it.

2755
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,700
My first game where I died not top 10.

2756
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,900
I'm lucky.

2757
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,380
GG's though.

2758
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:12,740
That was a...

2759
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,240
I don't think that was like even...

2760
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,320
That was a quick one.

2761
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,300
Yeah, that wasn't even one minute.

2762
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:20,680
I don't think so.

2763
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,800
Hey, at least that's a hundred dollars.

2764
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,400
You know?

2765
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,340
That's one way to look at it.

2766
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:31,980
Yeah, yeah.

2767
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:34,800
It basically paid off your chicken or rice.

2768
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,100
Uh huh.

2769
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,400
A lot of chicken and rice actually.

2770
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,080
Yeah, a lot of... yeah.

2771
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,080
At least you...

2772
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,400
It's alright.

2773
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:47,760
We look at the positives here.

2774
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,500
It's okay.

2775
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,300
As long as it's more than pro league.

2776
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,380
That's all that matters.

2777
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,760
We got the participation.

2778
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:00,680
Alright.

2779
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,820
I'm gonna eat my food.

2780
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:02,660
GG's though.

2781
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:03,480
GG's.

2782
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,280
GG's.

2783
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,160
Good luck in your next game too.

2784
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:07,260
Good luck.

2785
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,900
Guys, I don't think it's worth the chicken or rice.

2786
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,100
I don't think it was worth this chicken and rice guys.

2787
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,640
I don't...

2788
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,800
I don't think the chicken and rice was worth it.

2789
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,560
I didn't see them too.

2790
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,880
I'm so fast.

2791
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,340
But hey, the food.

2792
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,240
The food's though.

2793
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,140
Thanks, Mehdi.

2794
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:45,540
Thanks guys.

2795
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:49,460
Guys, I gotta play one minute with DropGaz.

2796
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,320
I gotta play...

2797
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:57,070
That's all that matters.

2798
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,310
That's all...

2799
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:05,910
Holy shit.

2800
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,610
Oh my god.

2801
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:11,850
That actually was the fastest game ever.

2802
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,810
The worst part is that it's duos.

2803
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:17,450
So I have to wait even longer cause there's more people.

2804
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:21,050
I think that's the worst part.

2805
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,770
There's more people.

2806
01:23:22,850 --> 01:23:24,650
So I have to wait longer.

2807
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:32,170
Oh my god.

2808
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,310
It's okay.

2809
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:35,950
It's okay.

2810
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:36,850
Now we're gonna...

2811
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:37,650
We're gonna be nice.

2812
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,030
We're gonna commentate.

2813
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:40,030
We're gonna...

2814
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:41,510
We're gonna commentate.

2815
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,930
I'll never forgive chicken and rice.

2816
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,590
I'll never forg... This... Oh!

2817
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,050

Okay, maybe not all the way down.

2832
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,050
Like I need some ambience here.

2833
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,770
Um...

2834
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:17,870
But!

2835
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:19,670

Officially a Gamersubs partner use Doki Bird for 10% off all purchases.

2839
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:34,370
This is a great time.

2840
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:35,850
I died early so I can...

2841
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:36,810
I can chill.

2842
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:39,510
I died!

2843
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:42,990
Okay.

2844
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:43,750
Guys.

2845
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,610
So what that means is that...

2846
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:54,810
I not only have a code but also... So like if you use the code... Obviously like... Obviously because I'm sponsored I get...

2847
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:58,690
Using the code really helps a lot for me.

2848
01:24:58,890 --> 01:24:59,710
And also!

2849
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,930
I will have an official Gamersubs cup!

2850
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:04,490
It's called a waifu cup.

2851
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:05,910
That would be the only...

2852
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:06,330
I don't know.

2853
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:12,590
It's called a waifu cup but it's basically a... You know like the cup to use to put your Gamersubs in.

2854
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,410
Or you know hold water or anything.

2855
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:15,530
It's like a Stanley cup.

2856
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:16,110
But better.

2857
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:16,990
But cheaper.

2858
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:17,810
You know?

2859
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:23,010
But not... It's like a Stanley cup but like not over... What was it called?

2860
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,390
Not over...

2861
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,390
What's the word called?

2862
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:28,790
When it's like over height?

2863
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,350
What's that word called?

2864
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,410
There's a specific word for it.

2865
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,930
So better.

2866
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:34,230
Yes.

2867
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:35,270
Of course it's better.

2868
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:36,610
It's gonna have my face on it.

2869
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:38,450
No!

2870
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:44,380
Let off a free game first!

2871
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,160
Oh yeah.

2872
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,160
Not overrated.

2873
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:46,700
Exactly.

2874
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,460
Goodbye Stanley Cup sponsors.

2875
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,360
But if Stanley Cup wants to sponsor me as well.

2876
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,640
If Stanley Cup wants to sponsor me as well, they're not overrated.

2877
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,340
But they are currently because I'm sponsored by Gamersubs.

2878
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,060
Anyway.

2879
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,040
Anyway.

2880
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,340
Uh...

2881
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,340
What was I saying?

2882
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:03,640
Oh yeah.

2883
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,740
There's gonna be...

2884
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,640
There's gonna be an art contest.

2885
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:09,640
That's gonna start next week.

2886
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:18,320
And basically whoever wins the art contest will have their art on my waifu cup and also win some prize money.

2887
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,360
Uh... It was originally...

2888
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:23,900
Gamersubs originally sponsored 5k for the art contest.

2889
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:28,040
Rules will be given on April 5th on how to submit.

2890
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:30,360
Uh... But Gamersubs originally...

2891
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,120
This is all paid by Gamersubs by the way.

2892
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,120
They put out 5k for the art contest.

2893
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,460
But I wanted to choose more people.

2894
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:43,340
So I added like 2k out of my own pocket because I want to be able to pay for more art.

2895
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,240
Like... Because you know guys I feel like you guys are gonna submit so many beautiful art.

2896
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:49,700
And I want to be able to compensate as many artists as I can.

2897
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,220
So I decided to pay 2k out of my own pocket to add to the prize pool.

2898
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,980
So it went from 5k to 7k.

2899
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:57,380
Uh... Just so I could be able to pick more artists.

2900
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,120
But only one artist will be on the cup.

2901
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,540
Only one artist will be on the cup.

2902
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:03,760
Um...

2903
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,420
And...

2904
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,060
Uh... Yes!

2905
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:05,820
So yes.

2906
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,360
Using my code helps out a lot.

2907
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,860
Uh... It really does.

2908
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,140
And it's on every purchase.

2909
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:11,800
All purchase.

2910
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:12,760
And everything.

2911
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,200
So like anything you want to buy just use my code.

2912
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,560
You get 10% off.

2913
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:17,600
Um...

2914
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:22,020
And... Uh... GamerSupps actually sent me like a package of their stuff.

2915
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:27,780
Like a bunch of... Like they sent me like $300 worth of GamerSupps products for free.

2916
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,500
To try them out and everything.

2917
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:33,160
And like... Um... As you guys know I love free stuff.

2918
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:33,960
So...

2919
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:37,740
Also my froleg!

2920
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,380
Oh my god!

2921
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,160
My mod...

2922
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,280
My mod is a better streamer than I am.

2923
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,880
Let me... I didn't even remember I had a referral link.

2924
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,040
I'm sorry GamerSupps.

01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,740
Okay here we go.

2940
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,180
I'm gonna re-pin this real quick.

2941
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,360
Uh...

2942
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,340

2943
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,540

Thank you!

2946
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,200
I really appreciate it.

2947
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,780
But anyway as I was saying.

2948
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:32,940
Uh...

2949
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,360
They sent me...

2950
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,800
I get to try a lot of flavors.

2951
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:39,860
Um... I didn't get to try all of them yet.

2952
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,520
But like... I think they're all...

2953
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
I think they're really liked so far.

2954
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,920
Is the melon one.

2955
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,160
The melon one's really nice.

2956
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,420
I really like the melon flavor.

2957
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,480
And there was like one more that I also like but I don't remember what it was called.

2958
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,460
It was... uh...

2959
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,860
I think it was the peach one.

2960
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:57,100
The melon and the peach one were...

2961
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,520
were really good.

2962
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,680
I haven't tried every one.

2963
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,840
Look guys.

2964
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:02,940
I was sent $300 worth of products.

2965
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:03,880
I was not...

2966
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,160
I... I...

2967
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,660
I did not have a lot of time to try out the rest.

2968
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,580
There were a lot.

2969
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:13,200
I didn't have time to try out all of them.

2970
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,460
But peach and melon were currently my favorites so far.

2971
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,060
Out of all the ones I was able to try.

2972
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,840
Of all of them I was able to try, peach and the melon... the peach and melon one was pretty good.

2973
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,560
Um... other than that... let's see.

2974
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,100
I'm trying to think.

2975
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:28,400
What else I need to show?

2976
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,760
Uh... but yes!

2977
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:32,720
Look forward to the art contest!

2978
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,800
Look forward to the art contest and I'm really really excited.

2979
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,940
There's also a lot of really good back to back news later on.

2980
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,860
So maybe more stuff being announced later on.

2981
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,340
So...

2982
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:48,920
Um... I'm trying to make sure to like not overwhelm you guys too much with everything.

2983
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,960
Because there is a lot of news.

2984
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:51,600
So...

2985
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,680
I'm trying my best to like not overwhelm you guys.

2986
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:55,380
Yes!

2987
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:56,880
My... Scars Cup!

2988
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,380
I got invited to my first JP tournament!

2989
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,840
As Doki!

2990
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,300
That's really... um...

2991
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,300
I don't know if I can tell you who my teammates are.

2992
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,500
I already know who my teammates are.

2993
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,580
Uh...

2994
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,260
But like they can speak English.

2995
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:11,620
So... um... so like...

2996
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,580
That's all I can say.

2997
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,460
But I don't know...

2998
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:18,420
who... if I can... I mean that sort of like... tells you who my teammates are.

2999
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,840
Because like there's not...

3000
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,600
like...

3001
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,980
Because like... um... it like limits... I guess it like...

3002
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,800
narrows down the participants of who they are.

3003
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:30,780
So...

3004
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,200
Yes!

3005
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,560
That narrows a lot of people!

3006
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,620
It narrows down a lot of people in JP!

3007
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:41,800
In general!

3008
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,540
So... like teammates can speak... can communicate in English with me.

3009
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,240
So I won't be... you know...

3010
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,000
So I won't be like a hazard!

3011
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:49,840
Hahaha!

3012
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:52,820
Hahaha!

3013
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,380
Um...

3014
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:53,860
But yes!

3015
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,680
I will be participating in my first... uh... Japanese tournament.

3016
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,680
Um... It has a lot of like...

3017
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,120
insane gamers out there.

3018
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:05,160
Like... you know... like there's like... this tournament there's a lot of like... professional players here.

3019
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,000
Um... It's like one professional player and two content creators.

3020
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,540
Basically per team.

3021
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,520
And...

3022
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,620
And... uh...

3023
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:19,640

3033
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:34,520

01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:07,160

3048
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:12,140
Technically it's three rest days.

3049
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,180
Um... due to everything that's going on.

3050
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,640
Uh... so...

Snuffy is gonna give me a tour on Roblox.

3061
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,740
She was very excited about that.

3062
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,660
She was...

3063
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:47,140
She was like...

3064
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,220
Oh my god!

3065
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:49,680

3068
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,220
And I was like...

3069
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:56,260
You know what?

3070
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:56,760
I'm down.

3071
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,720
Okay to be fair at first we were like...

3072
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:00,620
Oh my god!

3073
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:07,480
We should do Warrior Cats cause like in the past we actually really wanted collab in the past and do like...

3074
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,720
A Warrior Cats RP server on Roblox.

3075
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,100
Because Warrior Cats official server...

3076
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,260
Warrior Cats has an official Roblox...

3077
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,420
Uh... server.

3078
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:20,220
Hahaha!

3079
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,300
And like we've always wanted to do that.

3080
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:24,400
But we never got the perms to do it.

3081
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,400
So then...

3082
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,660
We were like... Oh my god!

3083
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:26,980
It...

3084
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,860
Is it time?

3085
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,600
Are we finally gonna do our Warrior Cats RP...

3086
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:33,180
Roblox collab?

3087
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,840
And then Snuffy was like... Oh my god!

3088
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,640
Can I give you a tour on Roblox?

3089
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:39,000
Can I show you like...

3090
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,480
All my favorite Roblox servers?

3091
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,240
And I was like... You know what?

3092
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:41,740
Fuck it!

3093
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,920
Let's... Give me the tour!

3094
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,060
Give me... Give me...

3095
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:45,640
The tour!

3096
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:47,640
So...

3097
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,000
We're gonna have a...

3098
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,560
We're gonna have a Roblox collab together.

3099
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:52,720
Um...

3100
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,760
On Wednesday.

3101
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:54,760
And then I think...

3102
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,960
After that... Um...

3103
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,960
It's karaoke on Friday.

3104
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:00,700
And then...

3105
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,920
Uh... Scar's Cup.

3106
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:02,640
I think...

3107
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:03,580
No Scar's Cup!

3108
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:03,840
Sorry!

3109
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:04,840
Scar's Cup first.

3110
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:07,280
And then karaoke later on.

3111
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,280
I think like Scar's Cup is like at 2 in the morning.

3112
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:10,920
And then...

3113
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,520
Oh!

3114
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:11,880
Okay!

3115
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:12,280
Wait!

3116
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,020
The team I spectate died.

3117
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:14,740
When did they die?

3118
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:16,720
I don't even remember they died.

3119
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,560
Okay!

3120
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:18,940
Anyway!

3121
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:20,100
Anyway!

3122
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:20,960
After that...

3123
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,680
Scar's Cup at 2 in the morning.

3124
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,140
Karaoke at 5.

3125
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,240
And then... The day after that...

3126
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,440
It's Challenger Circuit with Wig and Tempo.

3127
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:34,640
And I hope to fucking... I hope to fucking god that...

3128
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:35,220
Uh...

3129
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,680
I... I...

3130
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:39,500
I...

3131
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,840
I hope it's not 7 hours.

3132
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,220
I really hope it's not 7 hours.

3133
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:48,240
I really hope it's not 7 hours.

3134
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:48,860
I really hope it's not 7 hours.

3135
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,600
I'm just...

3136
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,600
You know when Tempo told me it's a 7 hour long day.

3137
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,240
I thought he meant like overall.

3138
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:59,240
But then... But then he was like...

3139
01:34:59,240 --> 01:34:59,360
No!

3140
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,860
It's just for one day.

3141
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,880
I was like... What?

3142
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,080
And then Wig...

3143
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,280
And then Wig was like... Okay.

3144
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,020
But theoretically...

3145
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,080
Only if we make it to the next day.

3146
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,320
So like... It's all... It's all about like you know... Making it to the next day and stuff.

3147
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:14,820
So like theoretically...

3148
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:17,160
There's a chance that we get eliminated early.

3149
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,920
So like... Let's hope to...

3150
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:19,800
No!

3151
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,680
We're gonna do our best!

3152
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,420
We're gonna do our best chat.

3153
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,440
We're gonna... We're gonna try our best here.

3154
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,040
We're not gonna fuck around.

3155
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,220
Oh yeah!

3156
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,340
I'll also be playing off stream with Tempo and Wig.

3157
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,380
They might be streaming it.

3158
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,200
I might... I'm not.

3159
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,480
I already have two Apex streams next week.

3160
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:38,860
So...

3161
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:41,440
I was just like... I'm just gonna play off stream with them.

3162
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:42,880
Yeah.

3163
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,080
So... We're gonna try our best here.

3164
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,120
Okay chat?

3165
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,520
I think that's everything!

3166
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,920
Is that everything?

3167
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:52,960
I think so.

3168
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:55,360
I think that is everything I have to announce.

3169
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,920
Mod, have I missed anything?

3170
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:57,480
Mod?

3171
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,340
Did I miss anything?

3172
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,300
See you in rank.

3173
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,040
Yeah we're gonna...

3174
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,880
We're gonna... I'm gonna be playing rank on...

3175
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,180
on Wig's stream.

3176
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,540
I'm pretty sure he's gonna be streaming.

3177
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,560
He streams every fucking day.

3178
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,220
Almost.

3179
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:13,840
Uhhh...

3180
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,920
Anything else?

3181
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:16,400
Is everything good to go?

3182
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:19,300
I'm gonna check if they announced game 4 yet.

3183
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:19,980
What is game 4?

3184
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,700
We have 3 more games.

3185
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:22,760
Oh!

3186
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,680
30 versus 30!

3187
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,740
There's no way I can drag down my team!

3188
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:29,960
There's no way I can drag down 29 other people.

3189
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:31,460
Hahahaha!

3190
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,180
Hahahaha!

3191
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,000
Hahahaha!

3192
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,300
There's 30 versus 30 people.

3193
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,220
There's 30 versus 30 people.

3194
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,220
There's surely... surely...

3195
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,900
I can...

3196
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,140
Uh...

3197
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:47,660
Oh!

3198
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:51,040
Last week to pre-order the Lunar New Year merch!

3199
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,340
By the way!

3200
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:57,480
This is the last week to pre-order the Lunar New Year merch chat.

3201
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,600
Umm... We have one more week left.

3202
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,380
We have one more week for Lunar New Year merch.

3203
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:14,760
Umm... People who ordered the buttons and stickers might... only the buttons and stickers might receive them earlier because I actually received the stickers before anything else.

3204
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,420
So...

3205
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,660
You might receive your stickers umm... Only for people who ordered stickers.

3206
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:25,180
Only the... only the people who only ordered the stickers and the buttons.

3207
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:30,500
Cause umm... They separated the delivery and I received the stickers first.

3208
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:31,360
So...

3209
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,180
So the other stuff will take a while to arrive.

3210
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:35,180
The other stuff...

3211
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,000
will still take quite a bit to arrive to us.

3212
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,160
When does everything else ship out?

3213
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,860
Umm... Most likely...

3214
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:47,280
May... May or June.

3215
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:48,220
Most likely.

3216
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,280
It's around May or June.

3217
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:54,640
Umm... The reason being is that the products are shipped via...

3218
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,880
a fucking giant boat.

3219
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,900
Like I take... I...

3220
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:03,320
I use the ocean to ship my products because there's a lot of them.

3221
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,840
And like...

3222
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:07,880
My air was really fucking expensive.

3223
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:08,820
Like yeah!

3224
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,700
I may receive them in like...

3225
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:11,660
2-3 weeks.

3226
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:12,960
But...

3227
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,360
Uhh... There were a lot of them.

3228
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,900
By air...

3229
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,080
It was a lot of them.

3230
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:18,940
So like...

3231
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:22,860
It was easier to just do it by cargo and by ship.

3232
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:25,500
Wait... Who won?

3233
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,580
Yeah... It's gonna go... It's gonna deliver by... by a boat.

3234
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,180
So that's why it's gonna take a bit to get here.

3235
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:35,100
Like... It was literally...

3236
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,680
Like if I chose plain option...

3237
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,360
It would have been like...

3238
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,040
If I chose the plain option...

3239
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,000
It would have been... It would have been so fucking expensive.

3240
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:47,060
Like it would have been like... half the...

3241
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,480
It would have been like half the price of the merch.

3242
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,400
And I was like...

3243
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,440
I was just like... What the fuck?

3244
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,780
I was like... Nah...

3245
01:38:58,780 --> 01:38:59,320
Fuck that.

3246
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,080
Fuck that.

3247
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,640
Holy shit.

3248
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,920
I do not need that.

3249
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:07,760
Alright.

3250
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,360
Let's see.

3251
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,140
Where are we?

3252
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:11,320
Where's... Where's Joki?

3253
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,860
Where's the... Are we in red or blue?

3254
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:15,880
I'm blue.

3255
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,700
I'm with Noddy and Doll.

3256
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,780
Noddy... Noddy's a roller player!

3257
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:22,520
Right?

3258
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,480
I need to brush up on my Apex Pro player.

3259
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,200
Um... Apex Pro.

3260
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:30,960
Noddy.

3261
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:32,880
Uh...

3262
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,160
Wait.

3263
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:34,540
Right?

3264
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,380
Or is he my... Yes!

3265
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:37,400
Battle Beaver!

3266
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:39,100
I knew it.

3267
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:39,860
God.

3268
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:43,900
Knew it.

3269
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,180
My... My first ro... Wait.

3270
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:46,400
No.

3271
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:47,760
It wasn't drop... Is drop roller?

3272
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,620
I don't remember.

3273
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,340
I actually don't... I don't remember my Apex Pro player lore.

3274
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,860
It's been way too long.

3275
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:56,200
It's been way too long.

3276
01:39:57,980 --> 01:40:00,400
I don't remember my...

3277
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:02,720
Oh yeah.

3278
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:03,060
Jen.

3279
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:03,800
Jen was roller.

3280
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,440
Yeah, but we were fucking punching people.

3281
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,540
That doesn't count.

3282
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,620
It doesn't count because we were punching people.

3283
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:12,400
Okay.

3284
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,840
You can use what you want but you have to stick with your team.

3285
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,760
Has the drops for both sides.

3286
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,620
For a match you spend to figure out which team gets which class.

3287
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,320
The winning team.

3288
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:20,680
Whatever.

3289
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:21,860
Whatever.

3290
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,640
Uh... Hal.

3291
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:25,840
I leaked the code.

3292
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:26,820
Okay guys.

3293
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,460
We're gonna get random people joining in because Hal accidentally leaked the code.

3294
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:31,440
Yeah we're...

3295
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:41,510
I leaked the code.

3296
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:42,450
I leaked the code.

3297
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:45,330
I leaked the code.

3298
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:45,350
I leaked the code.

3299
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,610
I leaked the code.

3300
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:48,250
Alright.

3301
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:50,370
I hope he didn't actually.

3302
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:52,970
You said he was gonna do that.

3303
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:53,930
Wait.

3304
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,290
What?

3305
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:55,350
What the hell?

3306
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:56,570
Alright.

3307
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:02,510
It's okay.

3308
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,450
You guys gotta rewind the time.

3309
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:04,690
I'm gonna find it.

3310
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:05,550
Did he actually?

3311
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:07,890
I can't tell if he was fucking around.

3312
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:09,550
If we did.

3313
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:10,230
If he did.

3314
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,530
People would fucking join in right now.

3315
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:13,650
Alright.

3316
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:17,770
I'm trying to see what's the next option.

3317
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:19,450
Alright.

3318
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:20,070
Let's see.

3319
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:23,330
Uh...

3320
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:24,030
Uh...

3321
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:29,560
We are in...

3322
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,500
This is game 4 drop.

3323
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:32,440
What the fuck is this?

3324
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,140
Are we C or A?

3325
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,980
My brain is...

3326
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,100
My brain.

3327
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:36,600
Okay.

3328
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:39,440
I think it didn't help that I woke up 30 minutes before this stream.

3329
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,960
I took a nap.

3330
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:41,720
I took...

3331
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,560
I took a nap before.

3332
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:44,400
Okay.

3333
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:45,720
We are assault.

3334
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:46,960
Then which one's controller?

3335
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:47,480
Wait.

3336
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:49,380
This map is so confusing.

3337
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,840
We're assault.

3338
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:51,200
Okay.

3339
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,080
We got...

3340
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,640
What the fuck is that?

3341
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,860
Yellow is no man's land.

3342
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
You cannot go in there until you see an admin type star in game What the fuck?

3343
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:00,860
This is actually.

3344
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,520
I thought we're gonna be like playing controller something.

3345
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:04,960
I thought.

3346
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:05,460
Okay.

3347
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:07,920
So we're playing storm point.

3348
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,320
And we're going on the side on the right.

3349
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,420
What is my team number?

3350
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,160
We got a new code guys.

3351
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:17,520
He actually did leaked it.

3352
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:23,560
I thought it was a joke.

3353
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,940
But he did it.

3354
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:25,800
That madman.

3355
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:27,320
He actually did it.

3356
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:34,000
I thought he was just fucking around.

3357
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,640
Our CEO guys.

3358
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:39,760
Alright.

3359
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,440
Let's see.

3360
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:41,780
Format.

3361
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,760
What's the next other games?

3362
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:44,420
Five and six.

3363
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:48,900
Five and six is three strikes again.

3364
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,300
And then punching again.

3365
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:51,620
So this is a lot.

3366
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:51,980
Okay.

3367
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:54,140
So team five is also three strikes.

3368
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:54,560
Okay.

3369
01:42:55,980 --> 01:43:00,020
We are with team sixteen.

3370
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:01,340
Alright.

3371
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,120
Team sixteen.

3372
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,140
Team sixteen.

3373
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:05,980
Let's see.

3374
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,220
Let's see.

3375
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,500
That's our CEO.

3376
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,160
The thing that does free content.

3377
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,450
Let's see.

3378
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:18,890
Sixteen.

3379
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:20,630
Hello.

3380
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:20,910
Hello.

3381
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:22,570
Hi.

3382
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:23,690
Hello.

3383
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:26,190
Let's go.

3384
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:27,710
Alright.

3385
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:28,810
What are we playing?

3386
01:43:29,730 --> 01:43:30,830
We have like...

3387
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:31,730
Yeah.

3388
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:31,970
Yeah.

3389
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:32,090
Yeah.

3390
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,470
But like what legends are we doing?

3391
01:43:35,070 --> 01:43:35,950
Oh assault.

3392
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:37,350
So anyone from the assault.

3393
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:38,650
Oh shit.

3394
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:40,410
That's what it meant.

3395
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:41,150
Oh.

3396
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:43,750
I was so confused.

3397
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:45,150
I was like what does that even mean?

3398
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:46,530
I was like...

3399
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:48,290
Hey guys.

3400
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:50,710
I'm the content creator here on this team.

3401
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:51,790
As you can tell.

3402
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,430
As you kids can tell.

3403
01:43:54,990 --> 01:43:58,050
The only times I play Apex is when I get invited.

3404
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,030
Alright.

3405
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:03,110
So what...

3406
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:06,410
Are we supposed to be in like separate discords or all together in one?

3407
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:07,190
Well we can...

3408
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:08,590
Let me see.

3409
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:10,570
We can do all... Oh I think we're doing all together.

3410
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:11,370
Sorry.

3411
01:44:11,610 --> 01:44:12,490
It's like a choice.

3412
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:18,210
You can either be in one voice chat which I think you know 30 people in a voice chat is a little bit fucked up.

3413
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:23,150
Or you can like join together in like your own team voice.

3414
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,230
Oh my god.

3415
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:26,090
Is the team six?

3416
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,230
What is going on there?

3417
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:28,550
Team six is the controller team.

3418
01:44:29,410 --> 01:44:29,750
Okay.

3419
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:29,930
Yeah.

3420
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,190
I'm trying to figure out who's who though.

3421
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:33,510
Like if that's the other team or if that's us.

3422
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,330
No that's the other team.

3423
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:37,550
Cause like Hal's in there.

3424
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:39,990
So Hal's on the controller side.

3425
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:42,830
So like...

3426
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:46,490
You can tell that our team is very corny.

3427
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:48,870
Our team...

3428
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:50,050
No one's taking control over here.

3429
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:53,890
I can tell that...

3430
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,350
Start telling everyone to move to 13.

3431
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:57,450
Yeah I think it's 13.

3432
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:57,890
Go 13.

3433
01:44:58,330 --> 01:44:58,870
Oh 13?

3434
01:44:59,130 --> 01:44:59,370
Okay.

3435
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:03,520
No...

3436
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:04,580
No...

3437
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:11,040
I don't want all of us in the same voice.

3438
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,040
No...

3439
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:23,160
I'm muted.

3440
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:25,920
I'm muted myself guys.

3441
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,820
Y'all if you see an assault character don't kill them.

3442
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:29,780
Don't shoot each other.

3443
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:32,480
What are the assault characters?

3444
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:33,860
What if we just...

3445
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:36,700
What if we just 30 men and one building.

3446
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,100
We're going against controllers.

3447
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:41,920
We're going against controllers.

3448
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,200
But okay.

3449
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,500
One of us out of the 30 of us should know where zone is right?

3450
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:46,460
At least a little.

3451
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:47,960
That's the whole point.

3452
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:50,500
If we get to the building first we win.

3453
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:53,340
I think Timmy's onto something.

3454
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,040
Okay lowkey that might work.

3455
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,540
Yo it's Timmy is cooking so bad.

3456
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,620
And then imagine like we all got a Maggie and we all drill in them too.

3457
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,040
And then imagine like we all got a Maggie and we all drill in them too.

3458
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:03,440
And then imagine like we all got a Maggie and we all drill in them too.

3459
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:03,520
Boss?

3460
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:05,640
No team?

3461
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:07,440
No Diddy.

3462
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,540
Wrong game.

3463
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:10,660
It's a party now.

3464
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,360
I'm just nervous for all the rollers.

3465
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,540
Like Timmy's saying don't kill the controller.

3466
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:18,760
Don't shoot our assault characters.

3467
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,900
My aim assist is about to go crazy.

3468
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,460
My aim assist is about to pull us.

3469
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,360
Wait MNK up right now.

3470
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,580
I forgot MNK is up.

3471
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:29,080
Yo MNK it's off now.

3472
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:29,840
Simmer down.

3473
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,900
Just make sure we calm like really really hard this game.

3474
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Should we have all the asses?

3475
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,500
Should we at least have one Maggie on every team by the way?

3476
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,980
I feel like Cry and aim assist.

3477
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,420
Like imagine Maggie fuse.

3478
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,080
Oh my god we're gonna be...

3479
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:52,860
I mean if we all have Bangled and then we have zone we just Bangled them and they can't cross.

3480
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:53,820
Yeah and then they put Watson on them.

3481
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:58,840
One Ashe on the team so we can all use the one teleport.

3482
01:46:58,860 --> 01:46:59,620
Nah it'll be fine.

3483
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:00,480
We can just pick the Jhin.

3484
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:04,080
I already have Ballistic so we just all insta-rayload.

3485
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,320
Does it work for everybody?

3486
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,120
Bro Nauti literally left our...

3487
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:10,340
Nauti is like...

3488
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:13,580
Nauti is like crashing somebody else's VC.

3489
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:16,260
He's not even in this one.

3490
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,680
Bro what the fuck.

3491
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:19,140
I got peer pressure due to this.

3492
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,620
Nauti literally fucking joined some other VC.

3493
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,980
He's not even with us.

3494
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:30,180
What the fuck is this bullshit.

3495
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:32,160
I sucked it up.

3496
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,000
I sucked it up.

3497
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,740
I sucked it up.

3498
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,060
I sucked it up.

3499
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:41,420
We have one single Ashe.

3500
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:42,800
So we're drilling people now.

3501
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,520
What if we have three teams.

3502
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:47,780
Three teams are Ashe and then they just fucking...

3503
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,820
They're like the secret agents and shit.

3504
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,260
Yeah they're like the power rangers.

3505
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,860
Who's the best rat out of all of us?

3506
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:54,660
Me.

3507
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:55,340
Me.

3508
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,340
Is that...

3509
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:00,700
This is so awkward.

3510
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,120
Bro this is so fucking awkward man.

3511
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,240
This is so...

3512
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:06,900
Oh yeah.

3513
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,780
What map is it?

3514
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,500
And we're on the east side.

3515
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:12,060
Too many cooks.

3516
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,360
Too many cooks.

3517
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,760
We got mills and downed beasts.

3518
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,220
I can't tell if it's gonna go...

3519
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:24,840
I think we're on the east side.

3520
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,120
We have to go right.

3521
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,720
We wanna make sure to split it.

3522
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,500
Bro all the controller pros.

3523
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,480
All the controller pros.

3524
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:35,640
Like fucking left us.

3525
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,020
They're in their own voices.

3526
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:39,020
This is so fucked up.

3527
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:42,040
Naughty joined the controller pros voice chat.

3528
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,680
Bro what the fuck.

3529
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:44,720
What?

3530
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:53,340
There's like Naughty, Sykes, Zynu, and Pho.

3531
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:54,240
There's like Naughty, Sykes, Zynu, and Pho.

3532
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:57,780
And like they're all in their own fucking voice chat.

3533
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:58,340
And like they're all in their own fucking voice chat.

3534
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:00,720
Let's do two lightning rods, two Zeus.

3535
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,300
One command.

3536
01:49:02,540 --> 01:49:03,480
Probably one storm.

3537
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:05,000
I think one...

3538
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,380
We should go cascade balls.

3539
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,280
And then they can go towards Jurassic.

3540
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:11,120
We should have one team launch pad.

3541
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,720
One team loot the bridge up high.

3542
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:14,640
And then they can go pylon.

3543
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,920
And then one Devastate and one Echo.

3544
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:17,940
Alright good.

3545
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:20,000
Wait wait wait.

3546
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,580
How are we assigning this to everybody?

3547
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:25,340
I'm just gonna say team 14 will take stormcatcher.

3548
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:25,920
Cause that's our team.

3549
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,380
Say what you wanna do.

3550
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,580
Inus just said team 11 to 20 left side of map.

3551
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:33,220
Oh what?

3552
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,720
Left side of map?

3553
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:35,500
See?

3554
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:39,120
I think for voice call as well though.

3555
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,080
Should we have like two teams per voice call?

3556
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,180
So we don't clutter everyone?

3557
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:43,980
No.

3558
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:48,320
Or you wanna just like all do our comms in here?

3559
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:51,420
We don't have to like just ping and game.

3560
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,180
Don't...

3561
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,600
I don't know I wouldn't want to comm in here.

3562
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,440
Oh light mag like 50% saying it.

3563
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,700
That is so weird.

3564
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:02,100
Res me or push this guy at the building.

3565
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:02,400
That is weird.

3566
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:04,460
Like initially...

3567
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:05,740
Everybody just point at your monitor.

3568
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,580
Point at your monitor?

3569
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:10,280
Point at your monitor.

3570
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,000
Just point him out.

3571
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:11,860
Don't cross.

3572
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,960
I think I didn't left side call.

3573
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:15,380
I didn't left side or right side.

3574
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:17,680
Cause then you will finish them please.

3575
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,380
Holy crap.

3576
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:22,120
Can this work?

3577
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,160
I'm writing something for you guys.

3578
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:28,140
What if I just join the other voice chat?

3579
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:29,780
Nice.

3580
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:29,920
Nice.

3581
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:30,900
Oh bet.

3582
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:31,840
So I'll go on launchpad.

3583
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:32,320
Perfect.

3584
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:32,960
That's all I need to know.

3585
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,200
Yeah that's fine.

3586
01:50:35,620 --> 01:50:37,200
Not delete it so they don't find...

3587
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,940
They don't get the strategy.

3588
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:43,340
There's no command on that list.

3589
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:44,620
So could have team 11.

3590
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,880
That is so helpful.

3591
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:48,280
And then pylon's 11 command.

3592
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:49,340
Yeah.

3593
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:56,280
Let me see how many cars are there.

3594
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:57,900
Fang, Fuse and Magi right?

3595
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,780
Where do we all want to meet up at?

3596
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:00,240
Alright so we're...

3597
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,720
Oh pylon's...

3598
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,080
This is so chaotic.

3599
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,520
We should most likely group up at...

3600
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,800
Drop can you start doing some IGL calls?

3601
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,060
Oh you want me to fucking...

3602
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:12,700
Pipe up?

3603
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:13,940
Pipe up.

3604
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:17,540
Bing, Mad, Magi, Fuse.

3605
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:18,980
We need to divvy up where people are going.

3606
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,140
We haven't.

3607
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:23,880
Our IGL isn't even with us!

3608
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:26,820
We need a new commander.

3609
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,460
Our commander is lost already.

3610
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:33,160
Our pro player IGL isn't even in this bullshit!

3611
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:34,820
I'm down for 10 years.

3612
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:37,460
He fucking left us with the other controller pros!

3613
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,680
I changed 11 to 12 for command because pylon's not in.

3614
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:41,620
I changed 11 to 12 for command because pylon's not in.

3615
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:41,660
I changed 11 to 12 for command because pylon's not in.

3616
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,860
Bro you fucking joined the controller pro side!

3617
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,800
So one time, where are we all landing?

3618
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,180
Look at tournament chat.

3619
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,220
Make sure you pick your characters.

3620
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:53,120
What is Lottie?

3621
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,820
I guess I'll do Mad Magi.

3622
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,220
I'm in the lobby.

3623
01:51:57,380 --> 01:51:58,180
I'm looking at the lobby.

3624
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:01,640
Oh, someone already DC'd.

3625
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:02,640
Am I have to restart?

3626
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:07,480
Wait, who's too loud?

3627
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,100
I don't even know who's too loud!

3628
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,220
There's 30 people!

3629
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,060
They're gonna restart.

3630
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:11,860
They'll probably restart.

3631
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:15,180
Okay, I turned it down.

3632
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,240
Guys, the thing is, I don't even know who's too loud.

3633
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:20,120
There's 30 people in here!

3634
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,120
I can't even tell!

3635
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,240
They're not restarting.

3636
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,180
Not restarting?

3637
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:28,060
Oh, there they are.

3638
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,400
They're not restarting.

3639
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:33,280
I'm gonna put the voice chat on fail.

3640
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,820
It's kinda scuffed.

3641
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:37,660
I'm not gonna lie, this is...

3642
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,500
I'm kinda getting over-stimulated.

3643
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:43,980
Guys, you know this server definitely does not have any boosts right now.

3644
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:47,100
Once he's put start...

3645
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:47,900
Pylon?

3646
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:48,480
Oh yeah.

3647
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,640
We all move at pylon?

3648
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,100
Yeah, once he types start.

3649
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:57,000
Nah, I don't think everyone, but I feel like the bottom side of the map teams should all move there and then group up.

3650
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:58,900
And then we need to like, group up.

3651
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,120
I mean, we don't know where the zone's gonna be, right?

3652
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:01,940
Cause there's gonna be zones.

3653
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,640
You can tell this server is boostless.

3654
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,480
I say we wait until the zone closes and then we decide to go somewhere else.

3655
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:16,440
Yeah, I mean, I think in general we should probably just group up or half go Cascades, half go Pylon and then we can just meet in the middle.

3656
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,920
We're also outgoing Zeus, by the way.

3657
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,220
We also have dogs on that north side that is available.

3658
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:22,080
So...

3659
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,440
One of you guys should do that.

3660
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:24,980
Oh, yeah.

3661
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:26,020
That's all available to us.

3662
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:26,580
Yeah.

3663
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,560
Yo, you think I'm breaking the rules from standing outside the line at command?

3664
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:34,060
I hit that spider that's in the line?

3665
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:38,200
Just fight spiders without crossing the line?

3666
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:39,400
Yeah.

3667
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,660
Make the spiders come to you.

3668
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:45,240
I feel like we need a hard rail height I feel like we need a hard rail height like, on everything.

3669
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:53,480
I do want to also point out, we probably should have roughly 30-30 snipers they have rampart walls so we do need to break those.

3670
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:55,280
You have rampart walls?

3671
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,740
What the fuck?

3672
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:58,060
Why didn't they get the gook side?

3673
01:53:58,260 --> 01:53:58,780
We're not fusing.

3674
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:01,940
We're just spamming at the rampart walls.

3675
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:02,680
I...

3676
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,120
If...

3677
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,380
Why didn't we get rampart?

3678
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,240
Is that fair?

3679
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,320
Oh, no.

3680
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,200
People DC'd.

3681
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,000
Scrims.

3682
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:15,620
Scrims.

3683
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,140
Scrims.

3684
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:17,600
Again.

3685
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:18,920
Please.

3686
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:19,580
Please.

3687
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:21,280
Oh my god.

3688
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:27,280
Get the 30-30 game out of my life faster.

3689
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:29,940
You might just give her every hit at that point.

3690
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:35,660
So is the voice better?

3691
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:37,340
I lowered the volume.

3692
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:38,260
Is it better now?

3693
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:39,840
No, play Ash.

3694
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:43,600
Oh my god.

3695
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:46,060
If somebody wants to be quirky and play Ash...

3696
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:48,500
Is the volume better now?

3697
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:49,620
There you go.

3698
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,300
I'll be a little lower.

3699
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,520
That's the new code, right?

3700
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:54,060
Has to be.

3701
01:54:55,740 --> 01:55:00,140
Why is this game the one that is the hardest to start?

3702
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:06,260
This is the game that I'm most uncomfortable with because there's too many people.

3703
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:13,500
My introvert ass can't handle this.

3704
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:14,840
I'm gonna repost our thing.

3705
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,700
I'm gonna post it too.

3706
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:16,980
Thank you.

3707
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:22,070
My introvert ass can't handle this.

3708
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:24,460
It's too many cooks.

3709
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,420
Suffering.

3710
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:32,700
Please.

3711
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:33,940
Is it not a new code?

3712
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:39,040
My social battery is gone already.

3713
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:44,500
How were you?

3714
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,280
Too many cooks.

3715
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:48,380
Too many cooks.

3716
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:49,600
No, I'm just loading back.

3717
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,440
Too many cooks.

3718
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:50,940
Too many cooks.

3719
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,120
It didn't get me the second time, but...

3720
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,700
I'm gonna go relay the information to our other peoples.

3721
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:03,760
I'm picking a bright orange Ash skin so everyone knows.

3722
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:05,060
Okay.

3723
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:10,520
Oh my god, we're coordinating our skins to a color?

3724
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:11,740
How cute would that be?

3725
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,620
That would be something.

3726
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,340
That would be...

3727
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:17,240
That would be...

3728
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:19,680
We need people going bean, by the way.

3729
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,760
What the fuck is bean?

3730
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:24,620
Is it... is it Cascade Balls?

3731
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,400
Balls, yeah.

3732
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:27,580
I'm so confused.

3733
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:30,280
That whole, like, those buildings on the south.

3734
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:31,140
North of Pylon.

3735
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:35,400
We could have another team from Command Center go down there.

3736
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,460
You know what's funny, chat?

3737
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:44,020
The other side, the other chat, all of them are like united and together.

3738
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:50,840
And then there's our team or the controller players literally left into their own voice chat.

3739
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:51,920
Like...

3740
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:59,780
Oh yeah, the thing you listed, by the way, of two teams, I feel like one of those teams needs to be...

3741
01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:00,960
That's really funny.

3742
01:57:02,860 --> 01:57:07,920
Our team, the controller players, don't even want to be together with us.

3743
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:09,500
Like, that's our team.

3744
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,340
No, not my voice.

3745
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:19,020
The other team is like, our team, the mouse and keyboard players, and the roller players are united together.

3746
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,220
One from Command Center.

3747
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,720
Probably one of the Command teams.

3748
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:24,880
Team 12, Cascade Balls.

3749
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:26,760
You mean Team 11?

3750
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,540
I just thought it was so funny.

3751
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,140
I never knew it was called that.

3752
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:33,340
It's literally all the roller players, too.

3753
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:34,360
Like, what the f...

3754
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,720
They're just like, we're outta here.

3755
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,080
And someone from the loose needs to do that.

3756
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:43,260
Wait, we don't know.

3757
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:43,500
Nevermind.

3758
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,000
Are these guys...

3759
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:48,980
Are they stealing our shot right now?

3760
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:51,180
Are they stealing our shot right now?

3761
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:52,280
No, we gave them time.

3762
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:52,760
No, we gave them time.

3763
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,280
I think we're just waiting on Red to connect.

3764
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:01,020
Wait, did Drop leave to see the controller gang?

3765
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,160
It's not even controller.

3766
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:06,580
What are you doing here?

3767
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:07,180
Get out.

3768
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:09,100
What are you doing here?

3769
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:09,540
Get out.

3770
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:12,500
Drop, leave their voice chat!

3771
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,500
You're not even part of that group!

3772
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:15,260
I don't think they will.

3773
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,500
Drop left to check on the controller gang.

3774
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,560
What if we just have all the controller players go to one side and then the MEK players go to the other side?

3775
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:27,940
Oh, they came back.

3776
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:28,880
Drop came back.

3777
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,700
What if we diviate the controller players?

3778
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:33,620
Put one in their center spot.

3779
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,560
What if we divide the role?

3780
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,220
The controller players go stand in the corner.

3781
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,520
Use them as bait.

3782
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,220
I mean, they're already doing that.

3783
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,640
Don't worry, I'm plugging in the keys right now.

3784
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,880
They're already doing that.

3785
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:46,200
You got a turret.

3786
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:48,520
Stop becoming one of you.

3787
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:50,260
MadMaggie time.

3788
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:51,860
Welcome to the dark side.

3789
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:54,240
I don't know what the strat is.

3790
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:57,020
I don't know what the strat is.

3791
01:58:57,080 --> 01:58:58,100
I'm just gonna play the game.

3792
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,100
I'm just gonna play!

3793
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:02,060
This is so scary.

3794
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,440
I don't even know what the strat is.

3795
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:07,560
I tuned out the strat.

3796
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:09,180
Which is pretty bad.

3797
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,240
I should not have tuned out.

3798
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:13,540
I have no idea where we're going.

3799
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:14,780
King Digi.

3800
01:59:15,740 --> 01:59:17,500
Let's go because we got hostiles.

3801
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:18,260
Let's go.

3802
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:19,880
We're going launch pad.

3803
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,180
Bullet tickets at command center.

3804
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:26,860
Guys, no!

3805
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,400
I can't be the first one in this team to die!

3806
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:31,320
There's 30 of us!

3807
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,180
I can't loot back side.

3808
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:35,020
I'm out.

3809
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,760
I'm gonna start from the front.

3810
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:40,300
I'm gonna loot front of storm point.

3811
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:41,500
Or storm catcher.

3812
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:43,920
Wait, what are the other assault tanks?

3813
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,840
I need to look it up.

3814
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,740
I'm really confused.

3815
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:52,080
Ash, Fuse, Mad Maggie, Bangalore, Rev.

3816
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:52,540
Okay.

3817
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,760
If I fuck up, it's not my fault.

3818
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,000
If I fuck up, it's not my fault.

3819
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:00,820
I got overwhelmed.

3820
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,060
I'm gonna follow Nadi.

3821
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:09,340
I'm gonna loot back here.

3822
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:11,940
I'm gonna loot back here.

3823
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:12,740
I'm gonna loot back here.

3824
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:16,060
Our pro player is not even with us.

3825
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:17,120
Our pro player is not even with us.

3826
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,480
I'm here.

3827
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,640
Who am I looking at with their nice little sword?

3828
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:24,440
Our pro player is not even in our chat.

3829
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,020
He left us.

3830
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:28,220
Oh my god, I almost killed him.

3831
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,040
Okay.

3832
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:30,880
They got zoned.

3833
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,540
What the fuck?

3834
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,360
Somebody code net.

3835
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,340
Bro.

3836
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:40,960
That's fucked up.

3837
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,720
That's really bad.

3838
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:43,740
What?

3839
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:47,280
They have red pipes.

3840
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,200
They have red pipes.

3841
02:00:49,580 --> 02:00:51,320
You see the rocks and shit over there?

3842
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:53,480
They nearly have red pipes.

3843
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:54,800
They have plastic barrels.

3844
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,660
We're just gonna flank them.

3845
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:59,300
Go all the way this side.

3846
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:01,120
We're just gonna hit a hot flank.

3847
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:03,120
I need a backpack.

3848
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,980
Bro, we might as well cross the nomad's land.

3849
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:07,320
We might as well cross the nomad's land.

3850
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,040
At this point...

3851
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,100
They got full on.

3852
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:18,660
If you guys need like specific loot with your team, you should probably just type in game if it's possible.

3853
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:19,700
That's probably the best way.

3854
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:21,840
Yeah, or even just use voice chat.

3855
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:23,960
Or voice chat, yeah.

3856
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:27,640
Wait, did I steal somebody's loot?

3857
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:28,880
I might have.

3858
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:29,340
Wait, no.

3859
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,080
We got... this is my loot now.

3860
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:36,680
Oh my god, we're so fucking stupid.

3861
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:37,740
Are we starting already?

3862
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,560
Oh shit, what the fuck?

3863
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:42,940
We have to just chill, I think.

3864
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:44,080
Honestly, I think we just...

3865
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:45,000
We have to go.

3866
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:47,760
...fucking log shed right now.

3867
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:49,280
I'll jive, I'll jive.

3868
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:51,160
I'm about to go all the way up towards the wall.

3869
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,900
IGLs, where do you want us to go?

3870
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:55,660
IGLs.

3871
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:56,960
IGLs.

3872
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:01,100
Where should we meet?

3873
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:03,360
We should meet Cascades.

3874
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:06,180
Maybe we rotate late, get all the harvesters, get our shits on.

3875
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:06,860
Yeah, I'm down.

3876
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,300
We need to get all our harvesters, but fuck.

3877
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:10,900
Yeah, we need to all get our armors up.

3878
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:12,780
Try and focus getting evil harvesters.

3879
02:02:12,820 --> 02:02:14,280
I'm gonna do those command spiders.

3880
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:18,180
You guys should split up and send each guy different harvesters.

3881
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:18,720
Yeah.

3882
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:20,220
Where's Nottie going?

3883
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:22,200
Where's Nottie going?

3884
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:26,040
It's a unit.

3885
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:27,700
The IGL unit.

3886
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,820
They're gonna be sitting behind walls for sure.

3887
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:35,240
I don't wanna get triple shot on.

3888
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:36,160
What do they say?

3889
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:38,880
Do we think Banks should take ultimate cooldown or tap cooldown?

3890
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,440
I think ult would go crazy right now.

3891
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:41,440
Ult cooldown, yeah.

3892
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,740
That's our teammate, right?

3893
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:45,900
Yeah, they're on our side.

3894
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:49,980
But if you die, probably mute so the people alive won't get confused.

3895
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:50,960
Oh, thank god.

3896
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:52,020
Makes sense.

3897
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,900
You should just stop calling out while you're down.

3898
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,140
Just rage really hard.

3899
02:02:58,380 --> 02:02:59,600
Start screaming you're holding knockdown.

3900
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:04,840
Guys, I could've put the descript list of all the people that's in our voice.

3901
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,320
Wait, wait, wait.

3902
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:05,640
What the fuck?

3903
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:07,660
Why is this guy shooting at us?

3904
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:11,840
Bro, is it... Do we can...

3905
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:13,040
There's a stupid Bang right there.

3906
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:17,340
Wait, we can farm armors off them, can't we?

3907
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:18,700
Did any of you guys loot walls?

3908
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:20,360
No.

3909
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,720
How does this round work?

3910
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,260
We have to cross to the other side.

3911
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,500
We have to cross here.

3912
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:26,620
We should shoot each other.

3913
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:27,760
We should shoot each other for Evo.

3914
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:28,480
Oh!

3915
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:30,160
Nice!

3916
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:32,860
That was mine!

3917
02:03:33,460 --> 02:03:35,280
But then we're just wasting...

3918
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,180
We're gonna lose our shields.

3919
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:38,020
Just wasting our time.

3920
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:40,520
Wait, wait, wait.

3921
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:42,040
That's actually smart as fuck.

3922
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:45,260
Wait, they're watsing too, so they get to spam it.

3923
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:46,700
They're dumbed out.

3924
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:47,620
What do we want?

3925
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:48,240
Wrecking Ball?

3926
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:48,920
Catch a spy?

3927
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,240
Okay, Wrecking Ball.

3928
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,320
And one of the...

3929
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:54,000
Whose car is this?

3930
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:54,480
That's us.

3931
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:57,640
Are you back?

3932
02:03:57,660 --> 02:04:00,120
I'm with you on your left, Ren.

3933
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:01,700
I'm looking for...

3934
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:03,000
I'm looking for juice for us.

3935
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:04,660
Yo, pylon is still unlooted, guys.

3936
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:06,400
Yeah, I'm going to pylon her now.

3937
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:11,960
We can do like the animal PLIs real quick too, or whatever the...

3938
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:12,800
Oh yeah.

3939
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:16,000
Yeah, it's probably important we get those for attachment.

3940
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,160
I'm literally like tuning out what they're saying and just following Naughty right now.

3941
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:21,060
I...

3942
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:23,900
That's my strat.

3943
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,280
I'm gonna believe in the controller.

3944
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,220
I think they're all group.

3945
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,240
In the controller squad.

3946
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:32,500
I'm gonna shoot in pylon right now.

3947
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:34,380
Just make sure...

3948
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:35,660
Yeah, you're good bro.

3949
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:36,420
We're in pylon.

3950
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:38,260
The council of IGL.

3951
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:41,180
Yo, I'm cast guys at the moment.

3952
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,500
There's too many people.

3953
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,740
Too many cooks.

3954
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:45,660
Too many cooks.

3955
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,000
What's up?

3956
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:48,440
Anyone Jurassic?

3957
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:50,480
No, we're in Jurassic.

3958
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,520
We're in Jurassic.

3959
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:54,560
We're at barometer.

3960
02:05:00,230 --> 02:05:00,850
What?

3961
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:02,490
I like nothing.

3962
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:07,730
I have nothing on my nemesis.

3963
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:08,270
I have nothing on my nemesis.

3964
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,670
We should have been better on them.

3965
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:12,730
Too many cooks.

3966
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:13,190
Too many cooks.

3967
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:15,610
That's not fair.

3968
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:19,030
They would have gone to hide in the corner really quick.

3969
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:19,210
They would have gone to hide in the corner really quick.

3970
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:23,110
We should have had the map with no zones.

3971
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:30,070
In my opinion, we should honestly start grouping now and go kill them because they are 100% running around the map trying to get their evas up.

3972
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:31,810
We should try to pick them.

3973
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:34,330
What spot are we regrouping at?

3974
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:35,030
Barrow you think?

3975
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:37,870
I just saw two of them just waste evac.

3976
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:38,570
So they're coming.

3977
02:05:38,710 --> 02:05:40,030
We should go to mill right now.

3978
02:05:40,090 --> 02:05:41,870
We should all go towards mill and try to kill people at mill.

3979
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:43,270
Bro, the mill is so far.

3980
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:44,710
Give us time though.

3981
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:46,050
Is that one of us that hit Kennen?

3982
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,390
Damn.

3983
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:49,110
That's us.

3984
02:05:49,610 --> 02:05:50,330
Look at us go.

3985
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:54,890
Where's the cascades?

3986
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:56,330
The IGL council has arrived.

3987
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:59,430
Oh my god, the mad Maggie council.

3988
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:02,930
We should have just gone towards check point and then going towards Mill now.

3989
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:05,610
What the fuck?

3990
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:09,190
Yeah, I'm going to be really mad.

3991
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:12,010
We should have flanked it.

3992
02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:13,870
We can probably take Godrock island or something.

3993
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:15,190
Aight, bullets to Diash.

3994
02:06:16,450 --> 02:06:19,010
You're talking about which side of the map?

3995
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:21,470
We should come from the north side.

3996
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:22,670
If we go mill side.

3997
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:26,230
If we go mill then we can go Godrock and then we can scout it.

3998
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:29,410
Take this island?

3999
02:06:29,410 --> 02:06:30,190
I'm gonna go Godrock.

4000
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:31,550
That's everything I registered.

4001
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:33,590
We're in C2.

4002
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:35,470
I'm gonna see where C2 is as well.

4003
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:39,550
That's everything I could register from this 30 man chat.

4004
02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:41,610
Nevermind, let's just go.

4005
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:42,110
We're walking over.

4006
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:43,390
Are you going Milfs?

4007
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:46,450
Yeah, we're gonna go Milfs.

4008
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:48,010
Oh my god, what the fuck is this zone?

4009
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:50,470
What the fuck is this zone?

4010
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:51,150
Oh my god.

4011
02:06:51,590 --> 02:06:52,610
What the fuck?

4012
02:06:53,950 --> 02:06:55,410
Why did he get everything?

4013
02:06:57,290 --> 02:06:58,610
I have a balloon.

4014
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:00,030
We can all rotate with a balloon.

4015
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:00,670
Oh!

4016
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:04,610
Oh, this can fucking take the balloon.

4017
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:07,950
We should keep going towards Milfs side.

4018
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:08,530
Yeah.

4019
02:07:09,950 --> 02:07:11,130
I'm gonna... I'm just...

4020
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:12,530
Yeah, I was gonna say...

4021
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:14,150
Let's all take the balloon.

4022
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:15,910
Crafting time.

4023
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:17,750
Crafting time!

4024
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:19,870
One at a time, everybody!

4025
02:07:20,470 --> 02:07:21,270
One at a time, everybody!

4026
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:22,390
There's gunshots in checkpoint.

4027
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:23,230
Who's in checkpoint?

4028
02:07:23,690 --> 02:07:24,470
Where's Dotty?

4029
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:25,730
She's shooting spiders.

4030
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:26,670
Where's Dotty?

4031
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:31,410
I see him on the God Rocker now.

4032
02:07:32,790 --> 02:07:34,130
Oh, Dotty's behind us!

4033
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:34,450
Oh my god.

4034
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:38,270
This is a bad zone.

4035
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:39,290
We can't use any bang-alls.

4036
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:40,230
They're all the way over there.

4037
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:42,270
We go C-Note then, right?

4038
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:43,590
No one's guarding the left side of C-Note, are you?

4039
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:45,090
The far left side entrance is C-Note.

4040
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:48,010
We should probably group up, no?

4041
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:51,330
Towards Barrow, right?

4042
02:07:51,570 --> 02:07:52,210
Going Bean?

4043
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:52,590
Yeah.

4044
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:53,010
Go Bean.

4045
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:54,770
Like a... Bean?

4046
02:07:57,790 --> 02:07:59,250
I have a 2x4.

4047
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:01,110
Nuddy, where are you going?

4048
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:03,590
We probably need to wait for a bunch of people too.

4049
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:06,670
There's no one holding the side.

4050
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:07,630
Yeah, let's do it.

4051
02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:09,270
Which side are you talking about?

4052
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:10,730
We're going beans.

4053
02:08:11,410 --> 02:08:12,710
Oh, he's getting the armor.

4054
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:15,830
Left side of Ceno.

4055
02:08:15,950 --> 02:08:16,670
We're on our way.

4056
02:08:17,090 --> 02:08:18,470
I'm going to go too.

4057
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:20,370
I don't want to be like...

4058
02:08:20,370 --> 02:08:21,110
Get in.

4059
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:21,250
Get in.

4060
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:25,530
I'm waiting for you guys.

4061
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:27,950
Is that people there?

4062
02:08:28,150 --> 02:08:28,970
Is that them?

4063
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:30,190
Yeah, that's them.

4064
02:08:31,230 --> 02:08:32,110
I'm in Cenote now.

4065
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:33,570
Yeah, we're moving up.

4066
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:34,590
Nobody close buildings.

4067
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:37,370
So you guys are at Mills?

4068
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:38,030
We're good at Mills.

4069
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:40,290
We're going bean right now.

4070
02:08:41,870 --> 02:08:44,470
We're moving into Ceno.

4071
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:45,190
I'm waiting for you guys.

4072
02:08:46,030 --> 02:08:47,470
We should probably just group up here and wait for everyone.

4073
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:49,130
On the main hill.

4074
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:50,510
Yeah.

4075
02:08:51,110 --> 02:08:53,350
Are you allowed to take care packs then?

4076
02:08:53,570 --> 02:08:54,070
Yeah.

4077
02:08:54,210 --> 02:08:55,310
I'm so scared.

4078
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:57,290
I don't see anybody.

4079
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:58,450
I'm so scared.

4080
02:08:58,710 --> 02:08:59,650
Oh, I see them.

4081
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,630
Look at their fucking shoes.

4082
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:04,990
We're going through.

4083
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:05,770
We're going through care packs.

4084
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:08,570
Oh my god, do you see that?

4085
02:09:11,610 --> 02:09:12,930
Oh my god.

4086
02:09:12,930 --> 02:09:13,930
Oh my god.

4087
02:09:14,330 --> 02:09:14,930
Oh my god.

4088
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:16,870
What the fuck?

4089
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:18,950
This is not fair.

4090
02:09:19,590 --> 02:09:20,830
What the fuck?

4091
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:22,850
Oh my god.

4092
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:25,830
What the fuck?

4093
02:09:26,070 --> 02:09:27,310
What the fuck am I looking at?

4094
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:30,730
You should stick by your teammates by the way.

4095
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:31,290
Oh shit.

4096
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:33,070
Bro!

4097
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:36,710
Dude, they're literally just sitting on top of those rocks.

4098
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:37,290
That's not fair.

4099
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:39,330
Bro, I would be on that team.

4100
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:41,670
They're going to have console.

4101
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:42,350
They're going to have console.

4102
02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:43,010
Bro!

4103
02:09:43,410 --> 02:09:48,350
I would be on that team.

4104
02:09:50,210 --> 02:09:51,090
They have a console over there too.

4105
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:52,070
I believe in this zone.

4106
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:56,370
They made a new POI.

4107
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:56,730
They made a new POI.

4108
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:58,670
They're going to have Watson gens and stuff.

4109
02:09:58,710 --> 02:10:00,570
They're going to have Watson gens and stuff.

4110
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:01,370
Oh my god.

4111
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:03,890
You said back side, south side of C note?

4112
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:05,770
All C notes open.

4113
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:09,630
Wait, it might be the one in the far back.

4114
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:10,830
It's like far left.

4115
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:11,810
Yeah.

4116
02:10:13,590 --> 02:10:14,030
Bro!

4117
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:16,550
Why can't I be on that team?

4118
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:18,270
Bro!

4119
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:21,670
Brooo!

4120
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:21,810
Bro!

4121
02:10:22,230 --> 02:10:22,330
Bro!

4122
02:10:22,390 --> 02:10:24,730
Look at this!

4123
02:10:26,650 --> 02:10:28,670
I could ask a TPS to one of the houses.

4124
02:10:28,970 --> 02:10:31,750
Can we fight left building, the far left building, break all this up.

4125
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:32,170
We have to, we have to.

4126
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:35,370
We're here with the Navy, we're here walking them.

4127
02:10:35,590 --> 02:10:36,530
This is us behind you.

4128
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:37,810
I can ulti the top of the wall.

4129
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:41,010
Yeah, you should do that.

4130
02:10:41,250 --> 02:10:41,330
We have a secure.

4131
02:10:41,790 --> 02:10:43,330
Give me a smoke to run into, give me a smoke to run into.

4132
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:45,070
This is actually crazy.

4133
02:10:48,270 --> 02:10:49,210
Ready to take the Ashe TP boys.

4134
02:10:51,990 --> 02:10:54,470
Oh I'm lagging in the server now.

4135
02:10:56,670 --> 02:11:02,330
Wait careful guys you might be shooting us.

4136
02:11:02,350 --> 02:11:02,910
One HP inside.

4137
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:04,630
Oh no.

4138
02:11:10,050 --> 02:11:11,510
I don't know what's going on.

4139
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:12,550
I'm following the crowd.

4140
02:11:14,130 --> 02:11:15,290
Careful not to kill each other.

4141
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:20,230
I can't tell.

4142
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:21,670
I can't.

4143
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:22,690
There's so many.

4144
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:23,750
Do not bang ult.

4145
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:25,390
I'm gonna kill each other.

4146
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:27,190
I'm on roof.

4147
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:28,550
I'm on top.

4148
02:11:29,170 --> 02:11:29,790
I'm on roof.

4149
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:32,410
Oh my god.

4150
02:11:32,470 --> 02:11:33,590
We're going in.

4151
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:35,770
I can't.

4152
02:11:35,870 --> 02:11:37,710
We need to get inside the building if we can.

4153
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:38,550
Okay.

4154
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:42,870
Okay I'm inside.

4155
02:11:42,950 --> 02:11:43,450
I'm safe.

4156
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:46,030
What is this?

4157
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:47,070
What is going on?

4158
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:48,750
I'm dead.

4159
02:11:49,590 --> 02:11:50,230
I'm dead.

4160
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:52,750
I'm coming.

4161
02:11:55,170 --> 02:11:55,810
I'm knocked.

4162
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:56,130
I'm knocked.

4163
02:11:56,330 --> 02:11:56,790
I'm dead.

4164
02:11:57,090 --> 02:11:58,290
I'm gonna try to res you Mario.

4165
02:11:58,430 --> 02:12:00,270
I can't cross.

4166
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:03,550
They're all trying to fucking push up.

4167
02:12:04,110 --> 02:12:04,950
Oh my god.

4168
02:12:05,110 --> 02:12:07,170
I can't see.

4169
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:09,190
I don't know who's my teammate.

4170
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:09,870
They're in building as well.

4171
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:10,510
Right there Jens.

4172
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:13,290
I can't see.

4173
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:15,350
Wait someone's finishing.

4174
02:12:15,650 --> 02:12:16,910
I have a respawn beacon.

4175
02:12:17,070 --> 02:12:17,730
I'm gonna put it right here.

4176
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:20,210
Is that the enemy?

4177
02:12:20,350 --> 02:12:20,930
I can't tell.

4178
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:22,790
I actually can't tell.

4179
02:12:24,130 --> 02:12:25,690
Oh fuck okay.

4180
02:12:26,350 --> 02:12:28,010
There's too many people.

4181
02:12:28,830 --> 02:12:29,750
I'm inside the building right now.

4182
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:31,310
Let me know.

4183
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:32,190
I need a respawn.

4184
02:12:32,310 --> 02:12:32,690
Oh shit.

4185
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:35,030
I stormed the beat.

4186
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:37,430
This feels like war.

4187
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:43,610
It's okay.

4188
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:44,030
Good try.

4189
02:12:44,690 --> 02:12:46,210
We're still inside the building.

4190
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:47,130
I got you.

4191
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:49,930
Oh my god this is war.

4192
02:12:50,110 --> 02:12:50,770
Are you good?

4193
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:52,310
I'm good.

4194
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:54,470
Yes the building is still in.

4195
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:54,750
I'm going.

4196
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:56,350
I might kill you.

4197
02:12:57,650 --> 02:12:58,690
We need to get inside.

4198
02:12:58,890 --> 02:12:59,650
I think we need to get inside.

4199
02:13:00,010 --> 02:13:00,850
Yeah we do.

4200
02:13:00,910 --> 02:13:01,550
We need to get inside.

4201
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:03,990
Some of them have blue armors in the building on the left.

4202
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:04,790
Can we drill this building?

4203
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:06,630
Yes I do.

4204
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:08,950
In which building are we drilling?

4205
02:13:10,790 --> 02:13:12,350
They're playing the opposite side from us.

4206
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:14,530
No one's inside middle right now as far as I can tell.

4207
02:13:14,530 --> 02:13:16,310
I'm coming through with a drill.

4208
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:18,510
See if you can shove the building.

4209
02:13:21,130 --> 02:13:22,630
I'm going to respawn you ghost.

4210
02:13:23,650 --> 02:13:24,330
Empire close.

4211
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,890
I knew the one.

4212
02:13:25,890 --> 02:13:27,390
I was going to destroy this one.

4213
02:13:27,810 --> 02:13:30,230
Oh my god.

4214
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:32,490
Every time I try to get there I just throw on the drone.

4215
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:33,130
Throw on the drone.

4216
02:13:36,170 --> 02:13:37,470
I'm about to suck your gas.

4217
02:13:38,050 --> 02:13:39,010
This is war.

4218
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:40,710
I just spawned in.

4219
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:41,470
On our roof.

4220
02:13:41,770 --> 02:13:43,570
You guys need to smoke the zip.

4221
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:47,510
Someone smoked the crosswalk and that's our teammate.

4222
02:13:48,610 --> 02:13:51,070
There's so many things going on.

4223
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:55,610
If you're going to do it you have to try right now.

4224
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:56,510
No.

4225
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:58,010
No.

4226
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,990
The fucking gas.

4227
02:14:00,070 --> 02:14:01,610
I couldn't tell which one.

4228
02:14:01,810 --> 02:14:03,770
I already used it.

4229
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:04,410
Guys.

4230
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:05,050
Naughty.

4231
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:07,030
You're so fucked Naughty.

4232
02:14:07,130 --> 02:14:08,950
You're so fucked Naughty.

4233
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:10,830
Use my...

4234
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:12,410
You got this.

4235
02:14:12,490 --> 02:14:13,950
There's so many armor swaps.

4236
02:14:14,530 --> 02:14:15,010
No way.

4237
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:17,150
I have no more shields.

4238
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:25,930
Anyone here on this side of the fucking...

4239
02:14:25,930 --> 02:14:26,670
I don't know man.

4240
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:29,170
Naughty.

4241
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:30,010
Come on Naughty.

4242
02:14:30,050 --> 02:14:32,190
I know you're confused.

4243
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:34,650
But I'm literally your teammate Naughty.

4244
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:36,470
Naughty I'm literally your teammate.

4245
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:37,390
Naughty.

4246
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:42,510
I'm literally your teammate Naughty.

4247
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:45,210
I know you're confused because there's so many people.

4248
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:47,230
But I'm literally your teammate.

4249
02:14:48,190 --> 02:14:49,570
I know you're confused because there's so many people.

4250
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:51,590
No.

4251
02:14:51,590 --> 02:14:52,790
I'm sorry Naughty.

4252
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:53,050
No.

4253
02:14:53,050 --> 02:14:53,050
I'm sorry Naughty.

4254
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:57,350
I'm back here inside of C9 with you guys.

4255
02:14:57,390 --> 02:14:58,110
You guys got any meds?

4256
02:14:58,110 --> 02:14:58,470
I'm pretty low.

4257
02:14:59,210 --> 02:15:01,630
Of course the moment he res is...

4258
02:15:01,630 --> 02:15:01,830
Of course the moment he res is...

4259
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:01,950
I'm coming.

4260
02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:05,230
Shields.

4261
02:15:08,770 --> 02:15:09,210
Bro.

4262
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:09,650
Bro.

4263
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:10,310
Bro.

4264
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,430
Bro.

4265
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:10,430
Bro.

4266
02:15:10,430 --> 02:15:12,490
This is like the most unfair game.

4267
02:15:18,710 --> 02:15:21,090
This is like the most unfair game.

4268
02:15:21,090 --> 02:15:24,170
This is actually the most unfair game ever.

4269
02:15:24,430 --> 02:15:24,890
This is actually the most unfair game ever.

4270
02:15:24,890 --> 02:15:25,210
To me.

4271
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:28,210
Oh my god.

4272
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:32,710
He hesitated.

4273
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:33,870
He hesitated.

4274
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:37,430
I was so free to rest for the longest time.

4275
02:15:37,770 --> 02:15:39,710
This is actually.

4276
02:15:40,270 --> 02:15:41,870
I can't believe.

4277
02:15:42,490 --> 02:15:44,670
We actually have to run the beach.

4278
02:15:44,830 --> 02:15:47,130
I can't believe we actually had to do that.

4279
02:15:47,230 --> 02:15:47,570
I can't believe we actually had to do that.

4280
02:15:47,570 --> 02:15:48,970
We had to storm that beach.

4281
02:15:49,150 --> 02:15:52,630
That's actually crazy that that happened.

4282
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:55,570
That.

4283
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:58,150
That was actually.

4284
02:15:58,430 --> 02:15:59,770
fucking crazy.

4285
02:16:00,770 --> 02:16:02,050
But like.

4286
02:16:02,170 --> 02:16:04,270
It was the most unfair to us.

4287
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:06,750
Cause we had to run to the beach.

4288
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:08,510
We had to run to the beach.

4289
02:16:08,510 --> 02:16:10,930
The team had to run to the beach.

4290
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:12,750
We reach against defence!

4291
02:16:13,410 --> 02:16:14,930
What the fuck!

4292
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:22,430
War... War never changes.

4293
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:29,270
Bro, there's no way our team's still alive.

4294
02:16:29,730 --> 02:16:31,030
There's no fucking way.

4295
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:32,190
I don't think, I don't think.

4296
02:16:32,550 --> 02:16:36,130
There's no way the assault characters are alive.

4297
02:16:36,410 --> 02:16:37,650
There's no fucking way.

4298
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:38,670
I think we're all dead.

4299
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:40,610
We're all dead.

4300
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:42,090
I legitimately think we're all dead.

4301
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:50,170
War... it never changes.

4302
02:16:50,790 --> 02:16:52,170
It really does.

4303
02:16:52,590 --> 02:16:55,790
War is not fair, Doki.

4304
02:16:55,950 --> 02:17:00,810
Bro, look at how many of the defenders are still alive.

4305
02:17:01,410 --> 02:17:04,450
Like, they only lost five people.

4306
02:17:04,730 --> 02:17:06,370
Oh my god.

4307
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:14,070
That's only five people died.

4308
02:17:15,530 --> 02:17:17,450
That's actually crazy.

4309
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:19,490
That's actually crazy.

4310
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:24,510
This is 100% defense sided.

4311
02:17:24,610 --> 02:17:26,870
I lost the 50-50 chat.

4312
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:30,650
I lost the lottery to be on team defense.

4313
02:17:31,290 --> 02:17:34,930
This is what Normandy feels like.

4314
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:40,290
Oh my god.

4315
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:42,970
They got the fucking...

4316
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:45,030
They got the map... they got the zone.

4317
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:47,510
They also got like...

4318
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:49,630
They got the zone as defenders.

4319
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:52,650
I think that's the worst part.

4320
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:55,730
If they were playing the same...

4321
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:58,290
I think if they were playing the same...

4322
02:17:58,290 --> 02:18:01,650
If they were on assault characters, I think it would be more fair.

4323
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:03,370
But the fact that like...

4324
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:07,490
They got the controller class and zone.

4325
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:10,190
That was... that was fucked up, man.

4326
02:18:10,410 --> 02:18:11,890
That was so fucked up.

4327
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:14,030
They actually won the gacha.

4328
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:15,210
Yeah.

4329
02:18:15,350 --> 02:18:18,930
They got the best possible zone for this fight.

4330
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:24,690
Holy shit.

4331
02:18:24,730 --> 02:18:25,690
That's so funny.

4332
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:29,050
That's actually so funny.

4333
02:18:29,610 --> 02:18:33,110
I can't believe we had to run at the beach.

4334
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:34,890
I can't believe that.

4335
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:37,190
Oh my god.

4336
02:18:41,870 --> 02:18:45,650
I can't believe we had to run at the beach.

4337
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:48,250
It's so poetic.

4338
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:49,990
It actually is.

4339
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:57,890
The thing is, I was so confused because I was worried I was going to shoot my old teammates.

4340
02:18:58,310 --> 02:18:59,970
That was the worst part.

4341
02:19:00,390 --> 02:19:01,470
I was just like...

4342
02:19:01,470 --> 02:19:03,030
Who's my teammate?

4343
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:04,870
It doesn't matter when you're in the game.

4344
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:08,930
But when you're in a fight, there's so many people around me, I couldn't tell.

4345
02:19:09,270 --> 02:19:12,750
And then we couldn't use Bangalore ult because we can ult ourselves.

4346
02:19:13,410 --> 02:19:14,710
So it was like...

4347
02:19:14,710 --> 02:19:20,370
We couldn't use Bangalore ult because we didn't want to kill ourselves with Bangalore ult.

4348
02:19:20,730 --> 02:19:21,610
I can't...

4349
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:27,110
That's actually crazy.

4350
02:19:31,890 --> 02:19:33,290
Oh my god.

4351
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:34,530
They're fighting each other.

4352
02:19:34,530 --> 02:19:35,650
We're fisting again.

4353
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:38,390
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

4354
02:19:38,890 --> 02:19:40,750
It's back to fisting.

4355
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:43,810
Oh my god.

4356
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:46,350
I like how we had like no man's land.

4357
02:19:46,710 --> 02:19:48,510
We established no man's land.

4358
02:19:48,790 --> 02:19:50,770
We're like, oh you can't cross no man's land.

4359
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:53,750
But it didn't matter because the zone was like their zone.

4360
02:19:54,150 --> 02:19:56,410
So we had to cross.

4361
02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:57,770
We had...

4362
02:19:59,730 --> 02:20:01,330
Oh my god, we were all here.

4363
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:03,450
We were all here for this.

4364
02:20:03,970 --> 02:20:06,230
The Apex Civil War.

4365
02:20:06,450 --> 02:20:09,410
We were all here for the Apex Civil War chat.

4366
02:20:09,810 --> 02:20:11,550
We were all here for the Apex Civil War chat.

4367
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:14,590
Okay.

4368
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:16,990
Oh my god.

4369
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:28,080
Oh true!

4370
02:20:28,420 --> 02:20:29,180
They're gens.

4371
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:31,900
You're right because they established the gens.

4372
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:34,780
War never changes.

4373
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:40,300
We didn't get the zone or the class we wanted.

4374
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:47,020
Yeah, we had the middle zone.

4375
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:48,080
It would have been more balanced.

4376
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:50,100
That was crazy though.

4377
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:52,220
The fucking wall that they made.

4378
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:54,300
That shit was insane.

4379
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:56,000
Shit.

4380
02:20:56,160 --> 02:21:00,080
Like looking at that wall live was actually insane.

4381
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:03,500
I can't believe that that was real.

4382
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:08,940
I can't believe that was that.

4383
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:09,980
I saw that.

4384
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:14,100
And then the... and then the final zone was at the beach.

4385
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:16,620
That was actually the craziest part.

4386
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:19,200
That the final zone was at the fucking beach.

4387
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:23,320
Yeah.

4388
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:32,040
Take notes guys.

4389
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:33,520
Take notes.

4390
02:21:33,820 --> 02:21:34,000
Alright.

4391
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,040
How much was that?

4392
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:37,780
That was uh...

4393
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:40,140
Oh my gosh.

4394
02:21:40,140 --> 02:21:41,180
Oh my god.

4395
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:43,440
They get double the fucking price for that.

4396
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:43,780
Okay.

4397
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:44,200
Let me...

4398
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,560
I need to know how much I got for that.

4399
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:47,140
I must get like a hundred or some shit.

4400
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:47,860
Alright.

4401
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,580
Four five zero zero divide by thirty.

4402
02:21:50,980 --> 02:21:51,740
A hundred fifty!

4403
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:53,940
I got a hundred fifty for that.

4404
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:54,520
Nice.

4405
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:55,780
That's fine.

4406
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:56,920
A hundred fifty is nice.

4407
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:01,720
Yeah, we got like major fucked up.

4408
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:05,680
We actually got major fucked up there.

4409
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:06,740
There's me.

4410
02:22:07,420 --> 02:22:11,400
I'm with Dwells and Sweet X Sage.

4411
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:12,720
Dwells?

4412
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:13,460
Who's Dwells?

4413
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:20,890
Oh shit!

4414
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:22,150
He's the Consul Pred!

4415
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:25,130
He's Consul Pred!

4416
02:22:25,330 --> 02:22:26,510
That's even better!

4417
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:31,410
Alright.

4418
02:22:33,850 --> 02:22:34,690
Let's see.

4419
02:22:35,690 --> 02:22:38,870
Um... and then I don't know who the other or my other one is.

4420
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:40,830
This is like...

4421
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:42,290
Let me check up.

4422
02:22:43,550 --> 02:22:44,950
X Sweet Sage.

4423
02:22:46,030 --> 02:22:47,210
Is this the right one?

4424
02:22:48,470 --> 02:22:49,030
No.

4425
02:22:49,150 --> 02:22:50,130
I typed it wrong.

4426
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:52,390
I was like, that's not the right one.

4427
02:22:58,580 --> 02:22:59,140
Okay.

4428
02:22:59,140 --> 02:23:00,980
Our pro player is a Consul Pred.

4429
02:23:02,260 --> 02:23:03,420
It's three strikes.

4430
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:05,860
Okay, but does he... does he...

4431
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:09,140
Does he have like the uh...

4432
02:23:09,140 --> 02:23:10,440
the brains?

4433
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:13,960
Okay.

4434
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:16,180
Code is...

4435
02:23:16,180 --> 02:23:16,360
Okay.

4436
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:16,360
Code is...

4437
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:16,500
up.

4438
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:16,860
Alright.

4439
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:18,140
Code.

4440
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:19,860
We got the code.

4441
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:28,740
Alright.

4442
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:29,800
We are team...

4443
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,300
What team are we?

4444
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:34,700
Uh...

4445
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:35,860
We are team...

4446
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:38,960
I already forgot our team.

4447
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:40,560
We are team...

4448
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:41,420
15!

4449
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:42,920
We're 15.

4450
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:44,440
Okay.

4451
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:48,220
Oh yeah, Sharko!

4452
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:49,900
Make sure you drink lots of water!

4453
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:52,500
Make sure!

4454
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:54,540
Don't... don't be...

4455
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:57,520
Don't drink... balance it out with water and stay safe, man.

4456
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:58,200
Stay safe.

4457
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:00,680
Okay, let me... Am I team 15 again?

4458
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:01,340
Alright.

4459
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:02,260
Team 15.

4460
02:24:02,360 --> 02:24:02,900
Alright.

4461
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:04,620
Holy fuck.

4462
02:24:04,660 --> 02:24:05,460
That was like...

4463
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:07,320
Bruh.

4464
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:09,860
What the fuck was that game?

4465
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:19,300
Wait...

4466
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:20,580
Oh my god.

4467
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,400
I'm still trying to...

4468
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:26,520
I'm still fucking processing what we just played.

4469
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:33,000
Like it was... it was actually we... saving Private Ryan right there, but what have we failed?

4470
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:33,960
Like...

4471
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:47,920
Oh my god.

4472
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:48,400
Oh my god.

4473
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:49,340
Oh my god.

4474
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:50,100
That's actually insane.

4475
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:52,220
Alright.

4476
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:53,640
Uh...

4477
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:56,780
I went through some PTSD shit right there.

4478
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:58,960
Alright, we're joining...

4479
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:00,360
We're supposed to join team 15!

4480
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:03,220
Team 15.

4481
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,200
That's so...

4482
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:06,160
Hi.

4483
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:07,680
Hello!

4484
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:09,660
Hello!

4485
02:25:11,480 --> 02:25:12,920
Go Evan, bro.

4486
02:25:14,680 --> 02:25:16,080
Hit him for like 20 damage.

4487
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:23,980
Okay, which... were you guys on the control... were you guys on the winning team or the losing team?

4488
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:24,820
Cause I felt like...

4489
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:25,240
Oh, losing team.

4490
02:25:25,560 --> 02:25:26,700
Okay, were we all...

4491
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:27,480
were we all losing?

4492
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:28,660
Okay, what the fuck was that?

4493
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:30,200
What the... they got the beach.

4494
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:33,640
We recreated... we recreated World War 2.

4495
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:34,940
But like...

4496
02:25:34,940 --> 02:25:41,080
In my history of playing Apex Legends the last four years, have I ever seen that zone.

4497
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:44,840
We... we literally had to storm the beach, but like...

4498
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:45,440
we lost.

4499
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,720
Like... that's not what history taught me.

4500
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,120
What the fuck happened?

4501
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:50,680
History didn't teach me this.

4502
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:51,380
Like...

4503
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:52,720
That was so rough.

4504
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:54,040
My frames were dead.

4505
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:55,300
My frames were dying.

4506
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:56,660
I was on like 90 frames.

4507
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:58,040
You were on 90 frames?

4508
02:25:58,440 --> 02:25:59,420
Aren't you on roller?

4509
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:00,660
You don't need the frames.

4510
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,020
Yes, I do.

4511
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:02,940
You're on roller.

4512
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:04,460
Does it matter?

4513
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:06,040
I can't even shoot my gun.

4514
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:09,520
It was terrible.

4515
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:11,320
That was terrible.

4516
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:14,440
Of course they get the zone and they were on control...

4517
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:15,880
they were on the controller characters.

4518
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:16,460
Like...

4519
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:17,340
what the fuck?

4520
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:18,380
Yeah, no.

4521
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:19,240
That zone was crazy.

4522
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:21,560
I've never seen it end on that little rock like that.

4523
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,600
That was actually fucking insane.

4524
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:26,360
Apparently only five people died on the other team.

4525
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:27,160
That's fucked up.

4526
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:27,700
Oh, it was five?

4527
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:28,200
Yeah.

4528
02:26:28,380 --> 02:26:28,860
That was just one.

4529
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:29,760
They said...

4530
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:36,540
They said five people died on their side while our entire team got wiped out.

4531
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:40,620
We didn't even get a single we only got five.

4532
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:45,440
I think I got to shoot my gun twice.

4533
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:47,560
I was just smoking.

4534
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:47,800
I was scared.

4535
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:49,540
I was scared I was gonna shoot my own teammates.

4536
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:54,480
I was so fucking Everybody was just like in my face.

4537
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:58,240
If that zone pulled the middle it would have been so much different.

4538
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:00,000
I feel like... Yeah, that would have been a lot more...

4539
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,680
Wasn't there a map where you could turn off zones?

4540
02:27:01,940 --> 02:27:02,840
Why didn't we do that?

4541
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,260
Yeah, you can.

4542
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:05,100
Why didn't we do that?

4543
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:10,420
There is a way to make it where you can turn off zones and just like everybody meets up in one spot and just battles it out.

4544
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:11,860
I feel like it's all in one spot.

4545
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:11,980
Yeah!

4546
02:27:12,940 --> 02:27:16,720
Why didn't... Why didn't we just do that instead of letting...

4547
02:27:17,620 --> 02:27:18,680
Instead of letting everybody in one spot?

4548
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,940
I didn't even have all of this.

4549
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:22,900
Alright, who are we playing?

4550
02:27:22,980 --> 02:27:23,500
Who are we playing?

4551
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:25,460
We need a Newcastle.

4552
02:27:26,600 --> 02:27:27,340
I think.

4553
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:30,400
I feel like Newcastle is very helpful here.

4554
02:27:30,580 --> 02:27:30,960
Oh yeah.

4555
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:31,820
Or Mirage at least.

4556
02:27:31,860 --> 02:27:36,440
Oh, that means three strikes so it's Newcastle uh... maybe Conduit?

4557
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:38,380
Conduit Horizon.

4558
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:39,760
Newcastle Conduit Horizon.

4559
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:49,400
Last time... Last time I played the last one I just died off rip because literally like we didn't have any kind of character that we could fight with.

4560
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:50,780
Yeah.

4561
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:52,600
Wait, what did you play last time?

4562
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:56,540
We were playing Conduit, Newcastle, and Caustic.

4563
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:57,080
It was that.

4564
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:59,400
Okay, so we just don't have Caustic then.

4565
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:00,640
We should have like someone...

4566
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:00,640
Yeah.

4567
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:01,960
I'm gonna play Horizon.

4568
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:02,680
Oh.

4569
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:06,080
I can do Conduit or Newcastle.

4570
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:07,780
Which one do you prefer, Sage?

4571
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,400
Um...

4572
02:28:14,020 --> 02:28:15,700
I don't think she wants either or.

4573
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:19,040
No, I like... Oh, are you saying like of those two which one would I prefer?

4574
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:20,920
Which one I would want to be.

4575
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:22,060
Yeah, which one do you want to play?

4576
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:23,980
Like which one are you more comfortable in?

4577
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:24,960
I'm a Conduit main.

4578
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:26,680
Oh yeah, I'll just play Newcastle.

4579
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:27,680
Okay.

4580
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:29,720
And this time I'll use my shield.

4581
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:38,920
I was on a team with Timmy for the the no strikes, three strikes or something and then he kept yelling shield but I thought he meant Conduit shield so I never...

4582
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:39,860
No!

4583
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:44,000
He was like, shield, shield, shield!

4584
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,420
And I looked at my Conduit and I was like where the fuck is the shield?

4585
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:48,200
And then, but he meant me.

4586
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:49,720
He was talking to me and I was like, oh!

4587
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:52,400
And then we died so I didn't understand.

4588
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:54,620
I was like where was the Newcastle shield?

4589
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:56,560
I was like, oh you were talking to me!

4590
02:28:57,920 --> 02:28:59,720
Cause he's... after shield he said Q.

4591
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:02,520
So I looked at my Conduit and I was like give me the Q.

4592
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:06,540
No, you're so real.

4593
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:08,560
I was like, yeah, where is it?

4594
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:10,300
Oh my gosh.

4595
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:18,300
So if you... so if you want me to use my Newcastle shield, please say Newcastle before you die.

4596
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:23,500
Oh, I didn't know we were on Olympics.

4597
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:23,780
You need to be specific.

4598
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:27,900
I feel a little bit better.

4599
02:29:30,580 --> 02:29:31,000
Alright.

4600
02:29:31,320 --> 02:29:32,980
Make sure you're not on Fuse.

4601
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:35,180
I'll be on Newcastle.

4602
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:35,960
I'll be on Newcastle.

4603
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:38,980
I'll be on Newcastle.

4604
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:47,890
Watts and mains are like eating this tourney.

4605
02:29:48,390 --> 02:29:49,010
For real.

4606
02:29:49,570 --> 02:29:51,130
I mean the next round is...

4607
02:29:51,130 --> 02:29:53,310
The next round is...

4608
02:29:53,590 --> 02:29:54,010
Punching again.

4609
02:29:54,270 --> 02:29:56,870
I hope somebody plays Crypto this time.

4610
02:29:57,330 --> 02:29:59,510
I think that's what's gonna happen.

4611
02:30:01,090 --> 02:30:02,230
Bucks a good choice too.

4612
02:30:06,130 --> 02:30:07,250
Wait, where are we dropping?

4613
02:30:07,650 --> 02:30:08,870
Did we even call a zone?

4614
02:30:09,150 --> 02:30:10,070
We didn't even call.

4615
02:30:10,310 --> 02:30:12,590
But I think we can go...

4616
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:14,830
I don't even know what's gonna be free.

4617
02:30:15,730 --> 02:30:16,490
Maybe Oracle?

4618
02:30:18,430 --> 02:30:19,290
I have no idea.

4619
02:30:19,330 --> 02:30:19,830
I didn't even check.

4620
02:30:23,010 --> 02:30:24,030
I don't know.

4621
02:30:24,130 --> 02:30:24,630
I don't know.

4622
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:26,830
I'm on 130 ping.

4623
02:30:26,950 --> 02:30:27,630
Are y'all on high ping?

4624
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:28,230
Nope.

4625
02:30:28,470 --> 02:30:29,370
Oh wait, yes.

4626
02:30:29,490 --> 02:30:29,930
160.

4627
02:30:30,210 --> 02:30:30,970
What the fuck?

4628
02:30:31,910 --> 02:30:32,350
160.

4629
02:30:32,970 --> 02:30:35,530
This is not even East Coast anymore.

4630
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:36,130
We're on Europe.

4631
02:30:36,750 --> 02:30:38,070
No, we're on Europe.

4632
02:30:38,130 --> 02:30:39,890
I get 100 ping on Tokyo.

4633
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:42,690
This is Europe.

4634
02:30:43,090 --> 02:30:43,930
Wait, what the hell?

4635
02:30:43,930 --> 02:30:45,390
Do you wanna go like way back here?

4636
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:46,490
Yeah, just go wherever.

4637
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:48,910
What the fuck?

4638
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:50,610
I'm gonna be really mad then.

4639
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:52,450
I'm on 150 ping on Europe.

4640
02:30:52,930 --> 02:30:55,250
I think there's one person coming here.

4641
02:30:55,450 --> 02:30:57,350
I'm pretty sure there is a team.

4642
02:30:57,550 --> 02:30:58,590
We're getting conned.

4643
02:30:58,910 --> 02:31:01,550
Do you wanna go here or do you wanna go here?

4644
02:31:02,370 --> 02:31:03,630
And then we can go to Icarus.

4645
02:31:04,330 --> 02:31:05,510
There's a team in Icarus though.

4646
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:06,910
Oh, okay.

4647
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:09,010
Just go to the compound.

4648
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:10,890
Just go to the compound that you ping.

4649
02:31:11,550 --> 02:31:11,950
Alright.

4650
02:31:12,130 --> 02:31:13,150
Oh my gosh, no balls?

4651
02:31:13,370 --> 02:31:14,210
You don't wanna con them?

4652
02:31:14,310 --> 02:31:14,930
We have three strikes.

4653
02:31:15,330 --> 02:31:17,490
Yeah, my flying was kinda...

4654
02:31:18,410 --> 02:31:19,450
Yeah, I apologize.

4655
02:31:20,590 --> 02:31:21,910
I was looking around too much.

4656
02:31:21,990 --> 02:31:23,030
Trying to figure out where the hell I was going.

4657
02:31:23,230 --> 02:31:24,790
My ping is going up.

4658
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:25,750
Oh, okay, match ended.

4659
02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:26,690
Thank fucking god.

4660
02:31:26,770 --> 02:31:27,650
Okay, I was gonna say.

4661
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:30,030
How is my ping going higher?

4662
02:31:30,250 --> 02:31:30,790
I was gonna...

4663
02:31:32,550 --> 02:31:34,690
Fucking Brazil servers or something.

4664
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:37,050
We're in...

4665
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:38,650
We're in fucking Sao Paulo?

4666
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:41,730
We're in Sao Paulo?

4667
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:43,950
We're in Sao Paulo?

4668
02:31:43,950 --> 02:31:45,630
Oh my god, back in rank we go.

4669
02:31:54,920 --> 02:31:57,320
Oh my god, back in rank we go.

4670
02:31:57,320 --> 02:31:58,680
Someone was on lifeline.

4671
02:32:02,260 --> 02:32:04,420
It's like nobody on Horizon this time.

4672
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:08,280
I'm seeing a lot of Newcastle Conduit, Caustic actually.

4673
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:08,920
Oh!

4674
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:10,860
It reset to London.

4675
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:11,760
Oh my god.

4676
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:14,300
I knew it was EU.

4677
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:15,780
I was like, this is EU ping.

4678
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:16,780
There's no fucking way.

4679
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:21,060
There's no fucking way.

4680
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:23,280
Everybody's on Conduit, Caustic and Watson.

4681
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,320
Yeah, that sounds about right.

4682
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:26,740
Yeah, I mean that worked out.

4683
02:32:32,110 --> 02:32:33,910
We're stealing strats from other people.

4684
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:34,110
We're stealing strats from other people.

4685
02:32:34,110 --> 02:32:35,150
Wait, someone has it on Mirage?

4686
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:36,370
Who's that genius?

4687
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:39,690
Who the fuck is cooking right now?

4688
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:45,020
It's that, uh, Tempur guy.

4689
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:45,900
Oh no.

4690
02:32:46,020 --> 02:32:50,340
I don't think Giggle got it, like, into play.

4691
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:50,860
I don't think Giggle got it, like, into play.

4692
02:32:51,020 --> 02:32:52,260
I think they started without.

4693
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:53,820
It's okay.

4694
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:07,810
Okay.

4695
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:09,010
Round two.

4696
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:11,630
Now we're definitely not in London.

4697
02:33:24,810 --> 02:33:25,530
Okay, how's it going?

4698
02:33:25,550 --> 02:33:26,550
How good are your zone reads?

4699
02:33:30,030 --> 02:33:30,470
Who?

4700
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:34,690
Well, of course you, the fucking pro player that's rank one.

4701
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:37,190
I'm not a pro player.

4702
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:40,590
Aspiring pro player.

4703
02:33:42,410 --> 02:33:43,490
I just got here.

4704
02:33:43,610 --> 02:33:45,730
I just got to PC like two months ago.

4705
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:47,110
I'm being called a pro player.

4706
02:33:47,910 --> 02:33:48,350
Again?

4707
02:33:51,030 --> 02:33:52,450
I'm not bad at reading zones.

4708
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:53,670
I'm not horrible at it.

4709
02:33:54,190 --> 02:33:57,830
Okay, but like, if you had, what is your position in your team?

4710
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:59,010
The roller player?

4711
02:34:00,310 --> 02:34:00,590
Yeah, yeah.

4712
02:34:00,730 --> 02:34:01,330
I have feelings.

4713
02:34:02,130 --> 02:34:03,950
The one on controller.

4714
02:34:04,370 --> 02:34:05,170
I play Bloodhound.

4715
02:34:07,510 --> 02:34:07,910
Alright.

4716
02:34:08,970 --> 02:34:10,070
Are y'all both on M&A?

4717
02:34:10,450 --> 02:34:10,850
Yes.

4718
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:11,910
Absolutely.

4719
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:16,150
Of course.

4720
02:34:16,330 --> 02:34:17,670
I'm just a content creator.

4721
02:34:17,790 --> 02:34:19,490
I haven't shot my gun.

4722
02:34:20,530 --> 02:34:23,050
Every single game, I've barely gotten to shoot my gun.

4723
02:34:23,210 --> 02:34:24,070
I feel like I'm dead.

4724
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:25,230
What the fuck?

4725
02:34:25,250 --> 02:34:27,910
Bro, you're giving me so much hope right now for our team.

4726
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:28,750
I am.

4727
02:34:29,870 --> 02:34:31,830
Listen, I'm completely and totally ready.

4728
02:34:31,830 --> 02:34:33,390
You're supposed to hype us up.

4729
02:34:33,490 --> 02:34:34,410
What the fuck happened?

4730
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:35,210
I am.

4731
02:34:35,210 --> 02:34:36,550
You barely shot your gun.

4732
02:34:36,550 --> 02:34:37,970
I'm ready to drop a 6k.

4733
02:34:38,190 --> 02:34:43,270
You barely shot your gun, but this is the game that's gonna change.

4734
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:43,670
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

4735
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:44,030
I'm warmed up.

4736
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:47,130
You are so warmed up with the zero kills, man.

4737
02:34:47,210 --> 02:34:47,810
You're so...

4738
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:54,050
Bro, I had a kill.

4739
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:55,630
I had a kill before you had a kill.

4740
02:34:57,090 --> 02:34:58,910
And I'm the content creator.

4741
02:34:59,590 --> 02:34:59,910
And I'm the content creator.

4742
02:34:59,910 --> 02:35:02,270
Bro, what's going on?

4743
02:35:02,310 --> 02:35:03,350
You got rank 1.

4744
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:04,110
What happened?

4745
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:05,730
Did you fall off?

4746
02:35:06,170 --> 02:35:08,010
No, I'm not falling off.

4747
02:35:08,070 --> 02:35:08,550
Did you?

4748
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:14,330
Don't worry.

4749
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:15,990
This is the game that's gonna change, right?

4750
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:16,870
This is it.

4751
02:35:17,450 --> 02:35:20,390
I got zero damage in the duels game, if that makes you feel anybody.

4752
02:35:21,190 --> 02:35:22,510
We got placed 8th, though.

4753
02:35:23,130 --> 02:35:24,050
Yeah, I got last.

4754
02:35:24,070 --> 02:35:28,590
I got last place in the duels, because Dropped was AFK getting chicken and rice.

4755
02:35:28,970 --> 02:35:30,350
So we had zero plans.

4756
02:35:30,970 --> 02:35:30,990
No way!

4757
02:35:32,850 --> 02:35:36,250
He went and got chicken and rice, and I asked him if it was worth it, and he said, yeah.

4758
02:35:37,070 --> 02:35:37,670
Oh no!

4759
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:42,310
As long as it was worth it, I guess.

4760
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:46,730
We still got $100 out of chicken and rice.

4761
02:35:47,270 --> 02:35:47,630
So...

4762
02:35:48,210 --> 02:35:48,870
Okay, period.

4763
02:35:48,970 --> 02:35:49,310
I love that.

4764
02:35:49,330 --> 02:35:51,010
Yeah, last place still gets $100.

4765
02:35:51,270 --> 02:35:52,310
That's all that matters.

4766
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:04,180
I believe this is it.

4767
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,800
You're gonna frag out here.

4768
02:36:06,900 --> 02:36:07,520
You've like...

4769
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:11,720
You've like stored all your fragging energy for this one game.

4770
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:15,320
Because after this game, you're just gonna be punching people.

4771
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:17,400
This is your last chance to shoot your gun.

4772
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:19,100
Oh, that's true.

4773
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:22,240
Yeah, this is his actual last chance to shoot the gun.

4774
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:27,900
Got this.

4775
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:29,560
Easy peasy.

4776
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:35,760
Also, how's the switch from console to PC?

4777
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:37,420
I think he like AFK'd a cry.

4778
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:38,680
No!

4779
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:42,560
No, don't cry.

4780
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,120
Maybe he went to go get some...

4781
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:48,080
some snack.

4782
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:53,400
Yeah, he's just on a snack break.

4783
02:36:54,340 --> 02:36:56,580
He's just on a snack break, guys.

4784
02:36:57,400 --> 02:36:57,880
Chicken and rice.

4785
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:00,720
It's okay.

4786
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:01,900
He's not gonna...

4787
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:04,840
He's off to get his own chicken and rice chat.

4788
02:37:05,180 --> 02:37:07,980
He's off to get his own chicken and rice.

4789
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:08,580
He's off to get his own chicken and rice.

4790
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:16,930
We got this.

4791
02:37:17,010 --> 02:37:17,630
Easy peasy.

4792
02:37:17,930 --> 02:37:19,390
I believe in our team.

4793
02:37:19,990 --> 02:37:21,690
We can't get worse.

4794
02:37:29,140 --> 02:37:29,660
Alright.

4795
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:32,860
Maybe we picked the right character.

4796
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:34,300
He did.

4797
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:34,640
Alright.

4798
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:37,680
Wait, are you actually still here?

4799
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:38,260
Who else?

4800
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:39,640
No, I'm pretty sure.

4801
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:41,420
I'm pretty sure he's actually on AFK.

4802
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:42,280
Like actually gone?

4803
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:44,000
I think he's AFK.

4804
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:46,780
Okay, if he's in the bathroom that long...

4805
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:48,420
I don't think he's okay.

4806
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:50,420
Yeah, wash your hands.

4807
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:54,380
I don't think he's okay if he's in the bathroom that fucking long.

4808
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:56,280
Okay,

4809
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:03,040
we're in the right area now.

4810
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:04,880
Let's hope that he's not Jump Master.

4811
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:05,520
Oh, thank god.

4812
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:05,840
Okay.

4813
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:07,660
Cause I'm pretty sure he's still AFK.

4814
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:13,590
I'm scared.

4815
02:38:13,930 --> 02:38:14,790
Where are we supposed to land?

4816
02:38:15,470 --> 02:38:16,150
I don't know now.

4817
02:38:16,290 --> 02:38:17,210
Now I don't know.

4818
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,690
It's AFK!

4819
02:38:19,290 --> 02:38:20,110
We couldn't check.

4820
02:38:21,390 --> 02:38:22,650
Oh, you have terrible luck.

4821
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:23,670
Just like...

4822
02:38:24,970 --> 02:38:27,290
How does two teammates go AFK?

4823
02:38:28,170 --> 02:38:29,150
Oh my god.

4824
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:31,570
I really don't know where to go.

4825
02:38:31,670 --> 02:38:33,410
I think we probably should just land right here.

4826
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:34,510
We're going back.

4827
02:38:34,510 --> 02:38:35,230
We're repeating this.

4828
02:38:35,370 --> 02:38:37,090
I mean, we have a teammate that's AFK.

4829
02:38:37,090 --> 02:38:38,530
I don't know what the fuck it is.

4830
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:39,670
Yeah.

4831
02:38:40,210 --> 02:38:41,410
Like I don't wanna like...

4832
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:43,190
I don't wanna contest anywhere.

4833
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:45,330
Where no people are gonna be at.

4834
02:38:45,550 --> 02:38:47,790
I don't think it's a coincidence anymore.

4835
02:38:48,130 --> 02:38:49,730
Two teammates that are AFK.

4836
02:38:52,770 --> 02:38:53,790
Now we'll split off.

4837
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:54,430
Are you back?

4838
02:38:55,350 --> 02:38:56,070
Yeah, I'm back.

4839
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:57,670
Oh shit, what happened to you?

4840
02:38:58,950 --> 02:39:00,070
Where did you go?

4841
02:39:01,550 --> 02:39:02,070
Nowhere.

4842
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:04,150
We were talking to you!

4843
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:05,290
You didn't talk to us!

4844
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:06,650
Talking to chat.

4845
02:39:07,070 --> 02:39:08,190
Oh my god!

4846
02:39:08,470 --> 02:39:12,170
You didn't even fucking answer back to us.

4847
02:39:12,170 --> 02:39:14,790
We had important questions about this game!

4848
02:39:15,710 --> 02:39:17,210
We were meta crafting!

4849
02:39:17,530 --> 02:39:18,650
We were theory crafting!

4850
02:39:22,030 --> 02:39:25,390
Oh, but I did ask you how you feel about switching from console to PC.

4851
02:39:26,290 --> 02:39:26,990
It's good.

4852
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:28,450
It feels better.

4853
02:39:28,590 --> 02:39:29,330
More crisp.

4854
02:39:29,570 --> 02:39:30,270
More responsive.

4855
02:39:31,270 --> 02:39:31,950
That's good.

4856
02:39:33,950 --> 02:39:35,610
We got a lot of cool people.

4857
02:39:38,470 --> 02:39:39,910
They got a little car right there.

4858
02:39:41,330 --> 02:39:42,150
I'm gonna grab this.

4859
02:39:46,990 --> 02:39:49,170
I wanna go try to fight the team at orbital, Loki.

4860
02:39:49,350 --> 02:39:49,950
Y'all got guns?

4861
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:50,730
Yeah, I do.

4862
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:51,870
I'm down to fight.

4863
02:39:52,230 --> 02:39:53,430
I'm okay to fight.

4864
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:55,750
Alright, let's walk up and hope we're okay.

4865
02:40:16,270 --> 02:40:17,130
Did I see them?

4866
02:40:18,350 --> 02:40:18,830
On me.

4867
02:40:18,890 --> 02:40:19,570
Literally on my roof.

4868
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:20,110
Literally on my roof.

4869
02:40:21,650 --> 02:40:22,310
I'm here now.

4870
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:23,290
Oh my gosh.

4871
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:24,990
Newcastle's weak.

4872
02:40:25,050 --> 02:40:25,570
Newcastle's weak.

4873
02:40:26,770 --> 02:40:28,210
Wait, there's a team on...

4874
02:40:28,210 --> 02:40:30,110
There's a third on the roof.

4875
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:31,790
I'm gonna fucking ape this guy.

4876
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:32,590
I'm gonna ape this guy right here.

4877
02:40:32,690 --> 02:40:33,730
Yeah, I'm inside the building.

4878
02:40:33,970 --> 02:40:34,570
I don't see anybody.

4879
02:40:35,070 --> 02:40:36,590
I'm going over to our...

4880
02:40:37,490 --> 02:40:38,270
He's by himself.

4881
02:40:39,810 --> 02:40:40,970
I don't know if I can kill him.

4882
02:40:40,970 --> 02:40:41,310
I don't have Q.

4883
02:40:42,730 --> 02:40:43,090
Nice.

4884
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:49,860
Oh my god, you did it!

4885
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:50,420
You got the kill!

4886
02:40:50,540 --> 02:40:50,880
Congratulations!

4887
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:51,840
I'm so proud of you!

4888
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:54,080
This is the game that's gonna turn around.

4889
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:56,120
I knew it.

4890
02:41:00,030 --> 02:41:01,030
I got the shield.

4891
02:41:02,090 --> 02:41:02,450
Upgrade.

4892
02:41:03,310 --> 02:41:03,970
Who's this one?

4893
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:05,050
I'm gonna Q in two.

4894
02:41:06,210 --> 02:41:07,210
I'm just gonna wait for it.

4895
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:07,930
They're both up here.

4896
02:41:08,250 --> 02:41:08,570
Yeah.

4897
02:41:11,310 --> 02:41:12,090
Uh, they jumped down.

4898
02:41:13,050 --> 02:41:16,110
We gotta wipe this so we can get our fucking... get their loot.

4899
02:41:16,450 --> 02:41:17,110
It's just two.

4900
02:41:17,250 --> 02:41:17,590
It's a few.

4901
02:41:17,590 --> 02:41:18,110
Are they in the building?

4902
02:41:18,230 --> 02:41:19,230
Yeah, they're inside here.

4903
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:22,490
Y'all drop through that door.

4904
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:23,670
I'm going in.

4905
02:41:23,950 --> 02:41:24,490
I'm going in now.

4906
02:41:24,550 --> 02:41:24,950
That's my nade.

4907
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:29,290
He's almost cracked again.

4908
02:41:29,350 --> 02:41:29,950
Hit 50 on blue.

4909
02:41:31,010 --> 02:41:31,490
That's mine.

4910
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:32,330
I'm going in.

4911
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:32,730
I'm going in.

4912
02:41:33,170 --> 02:41:33,890
He's on your side.

4913
02:41:33,970 --> 02:41:34,470
He's on your side.

4914
02:41:34,570 --> 02:41:35,590
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.

4915
02:41:36,630 --> 02:41:36,990
Dead.

4916
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:37,490
Dead.

4917
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:37,790
Full dead.

4918
02:41:37,850 --> 02:41:38,090
Nice.

4919
02:41:39,410 --> 02:41:39,890
Good job.

4920
02:41:40,210 --> 02:41:40,570
Hey!

4921
02:41:42,730 --> 02:41:43,090
Easy.

4922
02:41:43,650 --> 02:41:44,010
Easy.

4923
02:41:44,070 --> 02:41:45,150
Nothing to worry about.

4924
02:41:49,630 --> 02:41:49,990
Uh...

4925
02:41:49,990 --> 02:41:52,210
We need to make sure they don't drop back on us.

4926
02:41:53,350 --> 02:41:54,670
They might land on us.

4927
02:41:55,230 --> 02:41:55,970
Yeah, I'm trying to heal up.

4928
02:41:55,970 --> 02:41:56,610
Get their loot back.

4929
02:41:57,350 --> 02:41:59,490
I do kinda want a better light gun.

4930
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:02,210
So if you see like a R9 or a 301.

4931
02:42:02,210 --> 02:42:02,730
Me too.

4932
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:04,150
I have an RE.

4933
02:42:05,150 --> 02:42:05,630
Same.

4934
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:06,670
Which isn't the best.

4935
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:08,630
I dropped a purple energy mag.

4936
02:42:09,090 --> 02:42:09,510
Level 3.

4937
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:13,140
Uh...

4938
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:15,180
It's a Havoc here if anyone wants that.

4939
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,200
Um... no thank you.

4940
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:20,780
Hmm...

4941
02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:27,570
Where do you think zones gonna end?

4942
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:33,540
I can't read zones at all.

4943
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:35,540
It's gonna pull back to phase driver, Banzai.

4944
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:38,100
It's probably gonna hard pull back to fucking phase driver back here.

4945
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:40,680
So we should head over now just to grab a spot.

4946
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:41,860
Yeah possibly.

4947
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:43,860
See if we can, yeah.

4948
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:46,380
I grabbed an ulti-excel for us.

4949
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:49,220
Yeah ping me any...

4950
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:51,100
Sage and I need light guns.

4951
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:52,760
Better light guns so we can find any.

4952
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:55,020
There's an R9 in one of those boxes.

4953
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:55,860
There is?

4954
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,460
I'll go.

4955
02:42:57,740 --> 02:42:59,920
Is it from the horizon you killed?

4956
02:42:59,980 --> 02:43:01,200
Yeah it's the horizon box.

4957
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:03,080
It's like right there I'm pretty sure.

4958
02:43:03,360 --> 02:43:04,420
Oh he crawled all the way there?

4959
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:06,660
Unless it like is gone now.

4960
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:07,640
Yeah it's gone.

4961
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:08,400
God it's gone.

4962
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:09,560
Yeah no worries.

4963
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:11,320
We'll find something.

4964
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:13,220
They're fighting in front of us at this choke.

4965
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:15,140
They're poking I don't know if they're fighting.

4966
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:21,620
I feel like we should just get like a spot cause like kills don't really matter to us.

4967
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:24,140
Yeah I'm just getting people out faster.

4968
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:25,520
In the end they're just gonna...

4969
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:28,240
It's just gonna like uh...

4970
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:29,380
What was it?

4971
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:30,300
Lock up the...

4972
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:32,760
The respawn anyway by then?

4973
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:33,240
By then?

4974
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:34,900
Is someone...

4975
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:36,820
No okay.

4976
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:37,380
I thought it was a car.

4977
02:43:37,380 --> 02:43:38,180
It's even Icarus.

4978
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:39,460
Oh that landed in there.

4979
02:43:44,550 --> 02:43:44,950
Uh...

4980
02:43:46,190 --> 02:43:47,470
Uh take this blue knock.

4981
02:43:50,090 --> 02:43:51,350
Oh wait not me.

4982
02:43:51,490 --> 02:43:52,950
Haha just kidding.

4983
02:43:53,150 --> 02:43:53,610
Right here.

4984
02:43:53,970 --> 02:43:54,570
I'm ready.

4985
02:44:00,180 --> 02:44:01,380
Right in front of us right there.

4986
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:03,460
Just land on the building right here.

4987
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:04,140
Okay.

4988
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:06,660
Right here we can shoot this kid in the back.

4989
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:07,280
Okay.

4990
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:07,780
I'm shooting.

4991
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:09,680
Cracked one!

4992
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:10,080
I cracked one!

4993
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:13,200
I'm gonna ult.

4994
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:13,620
I'm gonna ult.

4995
02:44:13,700 --> 02:44:14,000
I'm gonna ult.

4996
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:14,340
I'm gonna ult.

4997
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:15,080
I'm getting on the building.

4998
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:17,380
Oh my god what happened to my ult?

4999
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:18,400
I'm batting.

5000
02:44:18,620 --> 02:44:19,140
I'm batting.

5001
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:19,420
I'm batting.

5002
02:44:20,300 --> 02:44:21,320
Yeah he already used it.

5003
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:23,300
There's somebody over here.

5004
02:44:23,360 --> 02:44:23,600
Over here.

5005
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:26,000
The last guy is over here.

5006
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:26,740
The last guy is on me.

5007
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:27,760
Right here.

5008
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:29,680
I'll try to kill him if y'all can.

5009
02:44:30,580 --> 02:44:32,980
He's kinda... I don't know.

5010
02:44:33,660 --> 02:44:34,260
He ran ran.

5011
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:34,820
I had the jitterbug.

5012
02:44:34,980 --> 02:44:37,300
He ran ran.

5013
02:44:37,340 --> 02:44:38,000
I can't get him.

5014
02:44:38,700 --> 02:44:39,880
Yeah you can come back.

5015
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:40,260
You can come back.

5016
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:43,080
I think he's just gonna wait for them to crawl back to them.

5017
02:44:43,220 --> 02:44:43,240
I think he's just gonna wait for them to crawl back to them.

5018
02:44:44,060 --> 02:44:45,860
Yeah but there's this other team like right here.

5019
02:44:45,900 --> 02:44:47,540
I don't wanna like separate too much.

5020
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:50,500
I think... I feel like I should get knocked.

5021
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:51,240
and you guys should res me.

5022
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:52,740
No no no no.

5023
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:53,940
I don't want them to like int.

5024
02:44:54,920 --> 02:44:55,740
Yeah but okay.

5025
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,180
I'll just full heal then.

5026
02:44:57,580 --> 02:44:58,980
Where are the bodies that we killed?

5027
02:44:59,040 --> 02:44:59,940
Cause they're just gonna crawl to him.

5028
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:01,700
They're just crawling towards him.

5029
02:45:06,070 --> 02:45:06,430
Okay.

5030
02:45:07,130 --> 02:45:08,310
Where is, um...

5031
02:45:12,030 --> 02:45:13,930
We're still playing left side of Icarus over here.

5032
02:45:13,950 --> 02:45:14,730
Back here if we can.

5033
02:45:15,410 --> 02:45:16,530
How many bats do y'all have?

5034
02:45:17,050 --> 02:45:17,710
I have four.

5035
02:45:17,910 --> 02:45:17,910
I have two.

5036
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:25,940
I think there might be a team still in here so be careful.

5037
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:28,080
Oh my god.

5038
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:29,480
What?

5039
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:31,220
Oh just right here where they were before.

5040
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:32,080
Yeah can you call me?

5041
02:45:32,260 --> 02:45:33,040
I'm gonna get right behind here.

5042
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:34,560
I don't know if I can get to you.

5043
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:37,680
I'm gonna get to Wells actually maybe.

5044
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,860
Yeah he's looking at me right now.

5045
02:45:41,880 --> 02:45:42,540
Oh no.

5046
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:43,600
Can you ult us?

5047
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:44,140
Just ult us.

5048
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:44,820
No I don't have ult.

5049
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:45,220
I don't have ult.

5050
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:45,680
I used it already.

5051
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:46,760
That's like... yeah.

5052
02:45:47,480 --> 02:45:48,260
I didn't have ult.

5053
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:49,440
He's pushing.

5054
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:49,760
He's pushing.

5055
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:50,200
Mirage pushing.

5056
02:45:54,740 --> 02:45:55,780
He's behind this box.

5057
02:45:56,960 --> 02:45:57,480
I think?

5058
02:45:57,720 --> 02:45:58,500
Because I see... yeah.

5059
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:02,360
I'm calling back.

5060
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:06,160
Probably bat.

5061
02:46:06,480 --> 02:46:07,220
I don't have Q yet.

5062
02:46:08,100 --> 02:46:08,780
I'm batting.

5063
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:09,140
I'm just throwing these.

5064
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:12,620
I have four.

5065
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:12,820
I see you.

5066
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:13,140
Look at Gromp.

5067
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:13,520
Rotate through.

5068
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:14,880
Rotate through right now.

5069
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:15,980
Pushing.

5070
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:19,000
Yeah that's the... that's the team that we knocked earlier in the past.

5071
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:21,860
I'm gonna grab something.

5072
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:22,580
Team at this building.

5073
02:46:22,700 --> 02:46:23,620
There's a classic team in here.

5074
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:24,360
I have Q.

5075
02:46:24,460 --> 02:46:25,360
I... I have ult here.

5076
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:29,740
They're just sitting in the building.

5077
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:32,220
I have like no frames right now.

5078
02:46:33,220 --> 02:46:33,880
Wow out.

5079
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:34,760
88.

5080
02:46:35,140 --> 02:46:35,680
Noo Castle one.

5081
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:36,680
Back one.

5082
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:38,820
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going one.

5083
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:41,960
Pull dead, pull dead, pull dead.

5084
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:42,440
I'll raise ours.

5085
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:42,720
I'm gonna raise.

5086
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:48,620
I'm grabbing this R9.

5087
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:49,920
Okay, go.

5088
02:46:52,140 --> 02:46:53,780
I want the shiiiits.

5089
02:46:56,320 --> 02:47:00,060
I have a- the fucking- that jitterbug, my body is like shaking.

5090
02:47:00,200 --> 02:47:01,800
Oh, that's not good.

5091
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:07,820
Um, I had it 2 for a moment.

5092
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:08,620
I don't know what it is.

5093
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:10,180
My frames are really bad right now too.

5094
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:11,360
Yeah, my frames are really bad too.

5095
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:12,920
I have like 80 frames.

5096
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:14,480
I was about to say flames.

5097
02:47:14,980 --> 02:47:15,520
I'm okay.

5098
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:18,400
Don't worry, I'll be here.

5099
02:47:18,460 --> 02:47:18,920
You're gonna have to kill everybody.

5100
02:47:19,420 --> 02:47:21,220
Don't worry, I can clutch this for us.

5101
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:22,820
You got it.

5102
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:23,700
I'm leaving you.

5103
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:26,180
I need like, uh...

5104
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,360
Let's see.

5105
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:29,260
Oh, I see you have a purple knockdown.

5106
02:47:29,320 --> 02:47:29,720
I need that.

5107
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:30,820
Okay.

5108
02:47:36,630 --> 02:47:40,250
Oh yeah, I'm like- oh, it's like only in that spot I'm like jittering really bad.

5109
02:47:40,490 --> 02:47:42,290
Okay, I dropped the blue for us.

5110
02:47:42,290 --> 02:47:43,010
Am I really close?

5111
02:47:43,230 --> 02:47:44,750
I wonder if I can reset my game.

5112
02:47:45,450 --> 02:47:46,230
I don't know.

5113
02:47:46,290 --> 02:47:46,950
That is risky.

5114
02:47:47,990 --> 02:47:50,370
I mean, I like- I'm fucking shaking all over the place.

5115
02:47:50,810 --> 02:47:53,430
It might be- it might just be because we're on the edge of the map.

5116
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:55,390
Like the closer I get like- No, it's been the whole game.

5117
02:47:55,470 --> 02:47:55,990
It's been the whole game.

5118
02:47:56,010 --> 02:47:56,490
For you?

5119
02:47:56,850 --> 02:47:57,170
Okay.

5120
02:47:57,690 --> 02:47:58,470
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

5121
02:47:58,630 --> 02:47:59,230
Just do it now.

5122
02:47:59,350 --> 02:47:59,830
Might as well.

5123
02:48:00,050 --> 02:48:00,510
Nah, it's fine.

5124
02:48:00,590 --> 02:48:01,110
It's fine.

5125
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:01,730
It's fine.

5126
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:02,850
Are you sure?

5127
02:48:02,890 --> 02:48:07,570
Like, if you can do it now then- I just don't wanna like- just not getting back into the game.

5128
02:48:08,090 --> 02:48:08,770
Okay, that's fair.

5129
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:10,570
We gotta rotate.

5130
02:48:12,610 --> 02:48:12,930
Hey.

5131
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:13,230
Hey.

5132
02:48:14,370 --> 02:48:16,110
Sometimes you can join back, sometimes you can't.

5133
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:17,070
We're just gonna play underneath here.

5134
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:17,890
We just hold everybody out.

5135
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:19,970
If there's not a team here- there needs a team here, actually.

5136
02:48:20,330 --> 02:48:22,390
The Watts and Newcastle team all left side, right there.

5137
02:48:22,870 --> 02:48:23,190
Okay.

5138
02:48:24,210 --> 02:48:25,210
I'm gonna try to fight them.

5139
02:48:25,290 --> 02:48:26,510
Try to like get them off of it.

5140
02:48:26,670 --> 02:48:27,250
I do have ult.

5141
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:31,110
I also have ult, but- Newcastle one!

5142
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:31,590
Newcastle one!

5143
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:31,890
Ooh!

5144
02:48:32,030 --> 02:48:32,830
They are coming here.

5145
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:33,190
Hold on.

5146
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:33,890
I'm gonna ult here then.

5147
02:48:34,630 --> 02:48:35,610
Am I ult up front?

5148
02:48:38,010 --> 02:48:39,590
And we have to because of this shit.

5149
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:41,210
Oh, they just ulted.

5150
02:48:41,210 --> 02:48:42,150
Oh no.

5151
02:48:42,370 --> 02:48:43,130
I might be dead to this.

5152
02:48:43,910 --> 02:48:44,230
Maybe.

5153
02:48:44,670 --> 02:48:45,130
I'm fine.

5154
02:48:45,170 --> 02:48:45,770
I'm fine for now.

5155
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:46,950
Okay.

5156
02:48:47,050 --> 02:48:48,110
You're gonna have to- We're gonna shoot them in.

5157
02:48:49,470 --> 02:48:50,070
We're just getting hit.

5158
02:48:50,070 --> 02:48:50,710
Oh, the nade.

5159
02:48:50,850 --> 02:48:51,030
Yeah.

5160
02:48:52,510 --> 02:48:53,010
Right here.

5161
02:48:54,850 --> 02:48:55,170
Yeah.

5162
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:55,910
This is bad.

5163
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:58,550
I might die to- oh wait, I'm s- I'm dead.

5164
02:48:58,830 --> 02:48:59,990
Just gotta keep spam pressing.

5165
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,730
Try to spam press.

5166
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:01,310
Yeah, I'm going for it.

5167
02:49:01,410 --> 02:49:02,110
I'm going for it now.

5168
02:49:02,430 --> 02:49:02,970
I'm gonna die.

5169
02:49:02,990 --> 02:49:03,650
They're pushing right here.

5170
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:04,470
Yeah.

5171
02:49:08,650 --> 02:49:09,590
A Cossack's one-shot.

5172
02:49:10,150 --> 02:49:11,330
I'm just gonna try to spam press you.

5173
02:49:11,330 --> 02:49:12,370
I can't freaking see anything.

5174
02:49:12,790 --> 02:49:13,370
Oh, I can.

5175
02:49:13,470 --> 02:49:14,190
I got knocked here.

5176
02:49:15,770 --> 02:49:18,970
I think with this we just have to...

5177
02:49:18,970 --> 02:49:19,430
Nice.

5178
02:49:19,510 --> 02:49:19,970
Play Song Tian.

5179
02:49:20,050 --> 02:49:20,330
Good job.

5180
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:25,560
Nice.

5181
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:27,400
I think you might be able to get a res.

5182
02:49:27,460 --> 02:49:27,820
Yeah.

5183
02:49:28,660 --> 02:49:29,240
Oh no.

5184
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:29,860
Good shit.

5185
02:49:30,060 --> 02:49:30,300
Nice.

5186
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:30,680
No shot.

5187
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:31,720
Got you.

5188
02:49:33,240 --> 02:49:34,800
Oh, I got knocked a bit.

5189
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:35,900
Oh, wrong person.

5190
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:36,220
Sorry.

5191
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:37,740
No, the team to the right got us.

5192
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:39,360
No way.

5193
02:49:39,360 --> 02:49:40,300
They're just focusing us.

5194
02:49:40,300 --> 02:49:41,520
They're not shooting that team at all.

5195
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:41,900
Yeah.

5196
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:42,680
It's okay.

5197
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:43,560
We had two restraints.

5198
02:49:43,620 --> 02:49:45,380
We just gotta- we can rotate to a better position.

5199
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:46,640
Yeah.

5200
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:47,580
Trying to figure out what a better position is.

5201
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:51,120
Do you want to try up here or no?

5202
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:55,000
Or like- like- I don't have a- Land on this bridge.

5203
02:49:55,060 --> 02:49:55,660
Land on this bridge.

5204
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:56,560
Land on this bridge right here.

5205
02:49:56,680 --> 02:49:56,800
Okay.

5206
02:49:56,840 --> 02:49:57,600
There's people under it.

5207
02:49:58,120 --> 02:49:58,480
Okay.

5208
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:00,760
I'm gonna look inside.

5209
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:02,360
There's a full team inside.

5210
02:50:02,600 --> 02:50:02,880
Fuck.

5211
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:05,260
I have a Q behind us.

5212
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:06,060
I'm gonna Q behind us.

5213
02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:07,240
Nice.

5214
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:08,460
Should we come down?

5215
02:50:08,540 --> 02:50:09,480
I'm gonna come down to you.

5216
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:12,360
I knocked- I'm shooting on this team inside so hard.

5217
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:14,080
Okay, okay, okay.

5218
02:50:14,080 --> 02:50:15,100
I knocked one and shot on two.

5219
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:15,280
There's another team.

5220
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:16,900
Another team is looking at us right now.

5221
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:17,420
Okay, okay.

5222
02:50:17,420 --> 02:50:18,260
I'm batting, I'm batting, I'm batting.

5223
02:50:19,640 --> 02:50:20,460
They rez'd it.

5224
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:24,720
Yeah, I mean- we might be able to rotate backside this way.

5225
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:25,480
I can.

5226
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:27,460
I'm getting shot- I'm getting shot from the other team.

5227
02:50:27,740 --> 02:50:28,700
I don't have Q, sorry.

5228
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:29,340
Yeah, it's fine.

5229
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:30,740
You can just Q me back up.

5230
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:34,520
I mean, like, can- Yeah.

5231
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:37,980
Team right here.

5232
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:38,700
Jump underneath!

5233
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:39,500
There's nobody underneath!

5234
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:40,380
Jump underneath, Sage.

5235
02:50:41,720 --> 02:50:42,180
I'm dead.

5236
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:43,440
I fell through a hole.

5237
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:44,820
Ooh.

5238
02:50:45,100 --> 02:50:45,680
Can you get underneath?

5239
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:46,620
Yeah, I'm getting underneath.

5240
02:50:46,820 --> 02:50:47,400
Yeah, I'm under- I'm under.

5241
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:48,620
Spawn near each other.

5242
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:49,820
There's a person right here!

5243
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:51,060
In the... like, they're right here!

5244
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:52,100
Underneath!

5245
02:50:52,180 --> 02:50:53,280
I think you can get the res off.

5246
02:50:53,300 --> 02:50:54,080
He's just chilling, it's a fucking fuse.

5247
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:56,980
Nice.

5248
02:50:57,040 --> 02:50:57,220
Nice.

5249
02:50:58,080 --> 02:50:59,220
Oh, he had the looking machine.

5250
02:50:59,360 --> 02:51:00,000
I'm trying to shield it.

5251
02:51:04,220 --> 02:51:05,620
I don't know where they are.

5252
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:06,300
Oh, they dropped down.

5253
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:06,900
They're right here.

5254
02:51:11,570 --> 02:51:13,110
I mean, there's nothing I can do.

5255
02:51:13,650 --> 02:51:15,110
Yeah, they're hard pushing now.

5256
02:51:19,370 --> 02:51:20,050
Nice try.

5257
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:21,930
It's hard.

5258
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:22,890
It's like...

5259
02:51:23,950 --> 02:51:27,610
Having to drop when everyone's already in fucking buildings is rough.

5260
02:51:28,530 --> 02:51:30,470
Like, this is what makes it so annoying.

5261
02:51:32,090 --> 02:51:32,950
Where do we do that?

5262
02:51:33,250 --> 02:51:35,090
I'm trying to look, I'm trying to look, I'm trying to look.

5263
02:51:38,750 --> 02:51:39,770
Is anybody on height?

5264
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:40,950
There's a team on height.

5265
02:51:41,430 --> 02:51:43,190
Do you want to try, like, on the wall right there?

5266
02:51:43,190 --> 02:51:45,130
Just land here, land here on me, land here on me.

5267
02:51:46,690 --> 02:51:48,450
Just like, try to AFK here in this corner.

5268
02:51:48,550 --> 02:51:49,350
Try to AFK in this corner.

5269
02:51:49,730 --> 02:51:50,730
Try to AFK in a corner.

5270
02:51:50,990 --> 02:51:51,570
Yeah, I'm trying.

5271
02:51:52,570 --> 02:51:53,730
They're... they're inting.

5272
02:51:54,970 --> 02:51:56,110
No, they can't jump down.

5273
02:51:56,230 --> 02:51:56,970
They'll fucking get fried.

5274
02:51:57,070 --> 02:51:57,870
Just AFK in a corner.

5275
02:51:57,950 --> 02:51:59,410
Literally, just AFK in this corner right here.

5276
02:52:00,810 --> 02:52:02,570
I... I'm in a different corner, but...

5277
02:52:02,570 --> 02:52:03,490
Hey, climb up when you can.

5278
02:52:03,570 --> 02:52:04,290
Just AFK here.

5279
02:52:07,650 --> 02:52:08,810
There's a team on the right.

5280
02:52:11,290 --> 02:52:12,710
Just literally don't make any noise.

5281
02:52:12,770 --> 02:52:14,290
Don't show any to sign up live here.

5282
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:16,650
Just living here.

5283
02:52:17,030 --> 02:52:18,210
This is our home.

5284
02:52:20,170 --> 02:52:21,650
All these fucking Skynaids.

5285
02:52:24,490 --> 02:52:26,730
They don't have a Watson above us, I'm pretty sure.

5286
02:52:27,230 --> 02:52:28,190
Um, I think they do.

5287
02:52:28,370 --> 02:52:29,410
I hear a bunch of...

5288
02:52:29,410 --> 02:52:29,670
Do they?

5289
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:30,430
Yeah, I hear a bunch of, like, shit.

5290
02:52:30,430 --> 02:52:32,410
There was a Vengeance up there earlier so I thought maybe...

5291
02:52:33,530 --> 02:52:35,230
How long until our ults, by the way?

5292
02:52:35,410 --> 02:52:36,010
Uh, fifty?

5293
02:52:36,270 --> 02:52:37,610
Um... I'm at fifty.

5294
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:39,030
Yeah, I'm at fifty-two.

5295
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:41,070
Oh, Sage, nice.

5296
02:52:41,690 --> 02:52:43,770
Look underneath, look underneath right here, look underneath right here.

5297
02:52:44,350 --> 02:52:45,250
Tommy, I'm just dead.

5298
02:52:45,470 --> 02:52:46,370
Oh my God, I got you, I got you.

5299
02:52:47,570 --> 02:52:48,650
You got a new castle wall.

5300
02:52:48,710 --> 02:52:49,790
You got a new castle wall if you have it.

5301
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:50,470
Yeah, I got it.

5302
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:50,770
I got it.

5303
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:52,230
Oh, dude.

5304
02:52:53,410 --> 02:52:54,970
There's... yeah, there's just people down here I feel.

5305
02:52:55,090 --> 02:52:55,870
Oh my god, what?

5306
02:52:57,230 --> 02:52:58,030
It's just so much.

5307
02:52:58,870 --> 02:53:01,290
There's literally just like two, three teams sitting right there.

5308
02:53:01,590 --> 02:53:02,730
There's so many people!

5309
02:53:03,070 --> 02:53:04,230
They all shot us!

5310
02:53:05,470 --> 02:53:07,050
They all wanted us dead!

5311
02:53:08,430 --> 02:53:08,750
Yeah, that was rough.

5312
02:53:08,750 --> 02:53:09,230
Holy shit!

5313
02:53:09,870 --> 02:53:10,910
Oh, we were fucked.

5314
02:53:10,990 --> 02:53:12,450
There was no way we were gonna get to zone.

5315
02:53:12,610 --> 02:53:14,190
There was no way.

5316
02:53:14,450 --> 02:53:15,030
Yeah, that's rough.

5317
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:17,530
We were not even close to zone.

5318
02:53:19,490 --> 02:53:20,530
Alright, nice try.

5319
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:22,350
GG's!

5320
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:24,410
See you guys in the next one!

5321
02:53:26,910 --> 02:53:28,010
GG's, GG's.

5322
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:32,380
Oh my god.

5323
02:53:34,500 --> 02:53:38,180
Holy shit, that zone pull was actually crazy.

5324
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:40,460
Oh my god.

5325
02:53:43,100 --> 02:53:46,100
We were not even like gonna...

5326
02:53:46,100 --> 02:53:46,760
We were not even like gonna...

5327
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:48,700
We were not even gonna fucking...

5328
02:53:48,700 --> 02:53:50,500
We were so far!

5329
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:53,540
This is where the zone landed onto!

5330
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:54,540
We were here!

5331
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:56,880
How will we travel?

5332
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,880
How are we gonna travel all the way?

5333
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:04,500
How are we gonna travel all the way?

5334
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:06,120
GG's!

5335
02:54:08,040 --> 02:54:10,760
Yeah, that was... that was insane.

5336
02:54:11,100 --> 02:54:12,100
That was actually...

5337
02:54:12,100 --> 02:54:13,580
We peaked early, chat.

5338
02:54:13,580 --> 02:54:15,680
We actually peaked early.

5339
02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:21,680
We were like everybody aiming at...

5340
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:21,920
Yes!

5341
02:54:22,220 --> 02:54:23,940
Everybody shot at us!

5342
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:25,880
Holy fuck!

5343
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:28,960
There was no way to live!

5344
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:31,080
That poor man!

5345
02:54:31,540 --> 02:54:33,100
That poor man got...

5346
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:35,180
Oh my god, that poor man got destroyed.

5347
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:38,080
I didn't forget to Q this time.

5348
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:40,760
Yeah!

5349
02:54:41,060 --> 02:54:43,020
I remembered to Q this time.

5350
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:47,780
Yeah!

5351
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:48,460
Yeah, I shot my gun!

5352
02:54:48,740 --> 02:54:49,840
We all shot our gun!

5353
02:54:50,180 --> 02:54:50,760
Thank god.

5354
02:54:54,780 --> 02:54:56,600
There was actually like...

5355
02:54:56,600 --> 02:54:57,520
No way to play.

5356
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:00,240
Everyone really...

5357
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:01,840
What the fuck was that sound?

5358
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:04,700
What the fuck was that gun sound?

5359
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:10,360
No more...

5360
02:55:10,360 --> 02:55:11,400
Now no more gun.

5361
02:55:11,580 --> 02:55:13,080
Now it's back to fisting.

5362
02:55:13,380 --> 02:55:14,460
Chat, we're back.

5363
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:18,260
I was getting too much money.

5364
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:18,960
I was getting too much money.

5365
02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:21,040
It was getting too good for too long.

5366
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:22,440
It was getting too good for too long.

5367
02:55:23,980 --> 02:55:26,980
I was getting way too much money.

5368
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:33,340
Yeah, that was a very weird energy gun sound.

5369
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:35,120
My guy.

5370
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:39,340
True.

5371
02:55:39,480 --> 02:55:41,160
Next one is LG, by the way, chat.

5372
02:55:41,380 --> 02:55:42,920
The next one is LG.

5373
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:43,060
Oh, gee.

5374
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,780
Okay, I hope... is this fucked up to say?

5375
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:48,020
Wait,

5376
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:52,100
I think they... oh my god!

5377
02:55:52,320 --> 02:55:54,820
Oh my god, I hope Timmy doesn't place higher so...

5378
02:55:54,820 --> 02:55:57,040
so like, I would be the best team they had.

5379
02:55:58,480 --> 02:55:59,560
No, that's... I'm joking.

5380
02:55:59,880 --> 02:56:00,920
I'm joking.

5381
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:03,860
No, he's gonna place higher.

5382
02:56:03,940 --> 02:56:04,520
He's gonna win.

5383
02:56:04,660 --> 02:56:06,840
I'm fucking... I bet you he's gonna win.

5384
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:07,920
He literally has deeds.

5385
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:10,560
He literally has deeds.

5386
02:56:10,560 --> 02:56:12,900
Like, on his team.

5387
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:14,380
Like, they're set.

5388
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:15,560
They're actually set.

5389
02:56:15,760 --> 02:56:17,240
And he has an EVA-8?!

5390
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:18,940
Bro, where was I luck there?

5391
02:56:19,240 --> 02:56:22,960
To be fair, I didn't fucking... I didn't fucking queue.

5392
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:23,940
That's my luck.

5393
02:56:24,120 --> 02:56:24,920
That's his luck.

5394
02:56:27,300 --> 02:56:28,700
Bro, he literally has deeds!

5395
02:56:29,220 --> 02:56:30,500
That's fucking crazy!

5396
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:33,580
He literally has deeds on his team!

5397
02:56:34,780 --> 02:56:35,620
That's insane.

5398
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:37,240
He got fifth?!

5399
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:37,900
Yes!

5400
02:56:38,240 --> 02:56:40,540
He was no... their team was no better!

5401
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:42,240
Better than my team... our team!

5402
02:56:46,140 --> 02:56:48,320
They got fifth?!

5403
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:49,600
We're the same!

5404
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:52,260
We're the same!

5405
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:58,280
You think about it.

5406
02:57:01,460 --> 02:57:03,840
We're the same.

5407
02:57:04,120 --> 02:57:05,240
Our team is the same.

5408
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:05,980
It didn't matter.

5409
02:57:06,300 --> 02:57:07,580
Our team won.

5410
02:57:09,820 --> 02:57:15,420
We both... when I was on Timmy's team, we also placed fifth.

5411
02:57:16,760 --> 02:57:21,420
Timmy... when Timmy is not on my team, he also placed fifth.

5412
02:57:21,580 --> 02:57:23,320
So, it didn't matter.

5413
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:27,140
It actually did not matter.

5414
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:32,980
It's the same.

5415
02:57:38,550 --> 02:57:41,010
My sportsmanship is off the roof.

5416
02:57:41,450 --> 02:57:44,650
I hope Joel didn't take my banter as too harsh.

5417
02:57:44,730 --> 02:57:46,430
I hope he actually didn't get angry!

5418
02:57:46,910 --> 02:57:50,130
I just was trying to lighten the mood...

5419
02:57:52,030 --> 02:57:55,650
I hope he realized that this was some friendly banter.

5420
02:57:56,950 --> 02:57:57,510
Hopefully.

5421
02:57:59,230 --> 02:58:01,210
I hope I didn't make him cry...

5422
02:58:01,210 --> 02:58:01,930
Hold on!

5423
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:12,400
It's VTubers now!

5424
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,080
Join the club!

5425
02:58:14,680 --> 02:58:16,540
Join the fucking club!

5426
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:22,980
We're playing Apex here.

5427
02:58:24,260 --> 02:58:24,900
Normies...

5428
02:58:27,540 --> 02:58:29,260
Normies don't know what to do.

5429
02:58:34,190 --> 02:58:35,850
Okay, let's see.

5430
02:58:35,910 --> 02:58:36,850
What's our last team?

5431
02:58:37,110 --> 02:58:39,290
Alright, our last team is...

5432
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:44,330
Oh, we got Naughty again.

5433
02:58:44,790 --> 02:58:45,970
And we got Sage.

5434
02:58:46,290 --> 02:58:47,330
What is this random...

5435
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:48,510
This is not random!

5436
02:58:49,010 --> 02:58:51,610
I get the same teammates all the time!

5437
02:58:51,690 --> 02:58:52,810
I swear!

5438
02:58:53,590 --> 02:58:56,390
I literally got Sage and Naughty before!

5439
02:58:56,670 --> 02:58:57,750
This is not random!

5440
02:58:58,690 --> 02:59:01,290
This is not...

5441
02:59:01,290 --> 02:59:04,050
Where is the variation here?

5442
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:12,890
I literally played with Naughty and I just played with Sage...

5443
02:59:13,230 --> 02:59:13,590
This is the last game!

5444
02:59:14,250 --> 02:59:15,730
How is this random?

5445
02:59:19,290 --> 02:59:21,790
Spotify Shuffle be like...

5446
02:59:21,790 --> 02:59:25,090
Has rigged this for me?

5447
02:59:25,250 --> 02:59:26,530
In what way?

5448
02:59:26,890 --> 02:59:28,870
He rigged it the opposite direction!

5449
02:59:28,910 --> 02:59:31,890
If it was rigged, I would be on the winning team!

5450
02:59:37,190 --> 02:59:41,670
If this was rigged, I would have been on control!

5451
02:59:43,230 --> 02:59:44,310
I would have been on fucking control!

5452
02:59:45,250 --> 02:59:45,850
And...

5453
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:48,410
On the other side!

5454
02:59:48,890 --> 02:59:50,690
I would not have been an assault character!

5455
02:59:56,590 --> 03:00:00,950
Alright, let's see...

5456
03:00:00,950 --> 03:00:02,950
We new code, new code...

5457
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:04,110
Where is the new code?

5458
03:00:04,910 --> 03:00:06,830
New code, here we go...

5459
03:00:07,770 --> 03:00:09,490
Alright, new code time...

5460
03:00:09,490 --> 03:00:09,790
New code!

5461
03:00:09,790 --> 03:00:09,870
New code!

5462
03:00:12,150 --> 03:00:13,350
What did I play last time?

5463
03:00:13,390 --> 03:00:13,910
Watson, right?

5464
03:00:14,090 --> 03:00:15,010
Yeah, I was on Watson.

5465
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:17,190
Watson!

5466
03:00:19,490 --> 03:00:19,890
Okay...

5467
03:00:20,870 --> 03:00:24,850
I didn't leak the code like last... I didn't leak the code like Hal did.

5468
03:00:28,090 --> 03:00:28,490
Uhhhh...

5469
03:00:29,450 --> 03:00:36,050
I was hoping they were there first so I can just join off of them, but they weren't, so I need to fucking look up the leaderboard shit again.

5470
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:38,510
Uhhhh...

5471
03:00:38,510 --> 03:00:40,030
Let's see...

5472
03:00:40,030 --> 03:00:40,610
Team 14!

5473
03:00:41,710 --> 03:00:42,830
Team 14...

5474
03:00:46,690 --> 03:00:47,250
Alright...

5475
03:00:47,250 --> 03:00:51,010
Let's see, let me get my boogie up just in case...

5476
03:00:51,890 --> 03:00:53,250
Can't believe it...

5477
03:00:53,250 --> 03:00:54,590
Can't believe it...

5478
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:56,150
What happens to meeting new people?

5479
03:00:56,290 --> 03:00:57,530
But not too many new...

5480
03:00:58,150 --> 03:01:00,370
Not too many new people though!

5481
03:01:00,670 --> 03:01:02,870
I like to meet new people gradually.

5482
03:01:04,230 --> 03:01:05,750
Like two at a time.

5483
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:06,710
Meeting new people.

5484
03:01:07,930 --> 03:01:11,250
I can't believe... I can't believe I got the same teammates as...

5485
03:01:11,250 --> 03:01:12,550
What are the odds?

5486
03:01:13,310 --> 03:01:18,150
I feel like almost every game I met like the...

5487
03:01:18,150 --> 03:01:20,770
Like one new... one of the person...

5488
03:01:21,630 --> 03:01:24,510
One person would be the person I played with last game.

5489
03:01:27,910 --> 03:01:31,910
Tempo gave me a head start with Jen and Timmy and said you're on your own.

5490
03:01:32,730 --> 03:01:35,450
And then after that I was like now it's real random.

5491
03:01:42,930 --> 03:01:43,450
Basically...

5492
03:01:43,450 --> 03:01:45,850
One or two people at a time.

5493
03:01:48,870 --> 03:01:49,930
Alright... but it was cool.

5494
03:01:50,130 --> 03:01:52,930
It was great that we got to play with Timmy and Jen though.

5495
03:01:53,150 --> 03:01:55,890
And like 30 seconds...

5496
03:01:55,890 --> 03:01:56,890
One minute was dropped.

5497
03:01:59,330 --> 03:02:02,910
The one minute one minute was dropped was like the peak there for me.

5498
03:02:03,110 --> 03:02:04,730
That was with the chicken and rice.

5499
03:02:05,010 --> 03:02:07,150
That shit was peak right there.

5500
03:02:07,270 --> 03:02:08,090
Chicken and rice.

5501
03:02:08,370 --> 03:02:09,090
There we go.

5502
03:02:10,530 --> 03:02:10,970
Uh...

5503
03:02:12,130 --> 03:02:12,570
Hello.

5504
03:02:12,570 --> 03:02:13,830
Hello again, Sage.

5505
03:02:14,890 --> 03:02:15,330
Hello.

5506
03:02:15,330 --> 03:02:16,790
Hello again, Naughty.

5507
03:02:17,330 --> 03:02:17,910
Hello, hello.

5508
03:02:18,430 --> 03:02:21,250
I can't believe this is... I've been playing with the same people all day.

5509
03:02:21,570 --> 03:02:22,590
Bro, it's not random!

5510
03:02:23,450 --> 03:02:24,370
It's not random.

5511
03:02:24,510 --> 03:02:26,070
They're just putting us back to back with people.

5512
03:02:26,310 --> 03:02:28,430
I refuse to believe this is random.

5513
03:02:30,070 --> 03:02:31,990
Yeah, I think it's like just...

5514
03:02:31,990 --> 03:02:33,170
I don't even know.

5515
03:02:33,330 --> 03:02:35,930
Just like either crazy luck or... Bro!

5516
03:02:36,130 --> 03:02:38,850
But then how did some teams get like all the pros?

5517
03:02:39,230 --> 03:02:39,870
How does that happen?

5518
03:02:40,170 --> 03:02:41,250
What the fuck?

5519
03:02:41,410 --> 03:02:44,930
At least like when you're random, you'll be like, wait, this doesn't look fair.

5520
03:02:45,070 --> 03:02:46,950
Let me just move them a little bit.

5521
03:02:48,530 --> 03:02:50,050
Like, what the fuck?

5522
03:02:50,110 --> 03:02:52,010
Timmy and Deeds on the same team?

5523
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:54,630
On a game mode where you actually shoot the gun?

5524
03:02:54,730 --> 03:02:59,010
I got Jen on my first game, but he doesn't... we don't shoot our guns because we're fisting people.

5525
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:01,030
Like...

5526
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:04,110
We got another no gun here.

5527
03:03:04,190 --> 03:03:04,550
This one.

5528
03:03:04,750 --> 03:03:06,310
These are like crazy unguards.

5529
03:03:06,310 --> 03:03:07,290
So, pros...

5530
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:10,550
Okay, are you the guy that knows zones?

5531
03:03:10,990 --> 03:03:12,650
Are you the zone guy for your team?

5532
03:03:13,610 --> 03:03:15,930
I know the zones, you know, somewhat.

5533
03:03:16,310 --> 03:03:18,370
The zones we've been playing today have been crazy.

5534
03:03:18,630 --> 03:03:19,990
Oh yeah, no, they were terrible.

5535
03:03:20,570 --> 03:03:21,830
Yeah, they've been so bad.

5536
03:03:21,990 --> 03:03:23,250
They're like hard to guess too, but...

5537
03:03:23,250 --> 03:03:25,950
We should get a good guess here.

5538
03:03:25,950 --> 03:03:29,330
Wait, did you call your POI yet?

5539
03:03:29,710 --> 03:03:30,310
Yeah, yeah.

5540
03:03:30,450 --> 03:03:30,990
Down Beast.

5541
03:03:31,230 --> 03:03:31,870
Alright, nice.

5542
03:03:31,950 --> 03:03:32,290
Okay.

5543
03:03:32,810 --> 03:03:33,390
Yep, yep.

5544
03:03:33,490 --> 03:03:34,210
We got down...

5545
03:03:34,210 --> 03:03:36,390
I'm on Watts... oh, Watts in.

5546
03:03:37,370 --> 03:03:38,470
Yep, you got Watts in.

5547
03:03:38,850 --> 03:03:41,910
And then I'll play Valk, and then if you wanna play Lifeline, Sage?

5548
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:44,350
Yeah.

5549
03:03:45,130 --> 03:03:46,250
Or would you rather...

5550
03:03:46,250 --> 03:03:47,390
I can play Lifeline.

5551
03:03:47,850 --> 03:03:48,170
Okay.

5552
03:03:48,330 --> 03:03:50,390
Do you not think that's a good...

5553
03:03:50,390 --> 03:03:51,950
Oh no, I can play Lifeline.

5554
03:03:52,630 --> 03:03:53,370
Yeah, it's fine.

5555
03:03:54,890 --> 03:03:56,390
Also, is there a slight echo?

5556
03:03:56,570 --> 03:03:57,650
Yeah, yeah, no, it's not.

5557
03:03:57,670 --> 03:03:58,270
I'm not using.

5558
03:03:58,530 --> 03:03:59,070
There's an echo.

5559
03:04:00,390 --> 03:04:01,190
Here, let me...

5560
03:04:02,150 --> 03:04:02,850
Sorry about that.

5561
03:04:03,230 --> 03:04:03,790
No, it's okay.

5562
03:04:04,150 --> 03:04:06,050
I was like, maybe I'm just really listening to myself.

5563
03:04:06,310 --> 03:04:06,530
I don't know.

5564
03:04:06,570 --> 03:04:06,790
Okay.

5565
03:04:06,890 --> 03:04:07,550
That's my mic.

5566
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:10,430
Maybe somebody this time is gonna play Crypto.

5567
03:04:11,070 --> 03:04:11,930
Oh yeah, I'm late.

5568
03:04:11,930 --> 03:04:13,750
After the lessons we've learned on the first game.

5569
03:04:15,270 --> 03:04:17,950
Maybe someone will actually play Crypto this time.

5570
03:04:20,990 --> 03:04:21,690
I believe.

5571
03:04:21,970 --> 03:04:22,930
I believe.

5572
03:04:23,130 --> 03:04:24,470
Wait, what's the Lifeline for?

5573
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:27,470
Uh, for the self-revive?

5574
03:04:27,550 --> 03:04:29,270
I took my headphones out, so if you're talking, I can't hear you.

5575
03:04:29,370 --> 03:04:31,550
Oh, wait, but would it matter though for self-revive?

5576
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:34,630
Because we're all just gonna fucking be in the mosh pit in the end.

5577
03:04:35,130 --> 03:04:37,930
Well, I mean, yeah, it'll definitely get you some extra placements though.

5578
03:04:38,030 --> 03:04:39,030
You know, just like...

5579
03:04:40,110 --> 03:04:42,730
Because you still have to get Thirsted as Lifeline if you get knocked.

5580
03:04:43,970 --> 03:04:48,750
But at the same time, you might be right regarding that because there's so many fences.

5581
03:04:48,890 --> 03:04:50,510
But if there's a Crypto, Lifeline's so good.

5582
03:04:52,010 --> 03:04:53,910
Like if Crypto blows everything up.

5583
03:04:54,310 --> 03:04:55,650
Takes all the fences out.

5584
03:04:56,790 --> 03:04:57,530
Oh, okay.

5585
03:04:57,710 --> 03:04:58,090
Okay.

5586
03:04:58,170 --> 03:05:00,750
Yeah, I was just thinking like, uh...

5587
03:05:01,870 --> 03:05:03,730
I was just thinking like, oh man.

5588
03:05:04,630 --> 03:05:05,090
Are we...

5589
03:05:06,410 --> 03:05:08,970
Will she even survive long enough to...

5590
03:05:10,290 --> 03:05:13,430
Yeah, it's kinda... Honestly, maybe like a Wraith instead of Lifeline?

5591
03:05:13,590 --> 03:05:13,870
I don't know.

5592
03:05:14,010 --> 03:05:14,830
Or like Caustic.

5593
03:05:15,110 --> 03:05:17,170
Caustic was really good for my first game.

5594
03:05:17,750 --> 03:05:18,750
For your no punch?

5595
03:05:19,010 --> 03:05:19,970
Yeah, yeah, no punch.

5596
03:05:21,270 --> 03:05:24,710
Because we just had the gas cannons to like, make them knock...

5597
03:05:24,710 --> 03:05:26,870
Like, you know, take some extra damage.

5598
03:05:27,510 --> 03:05:28,570
Yeah, I mean, duh.

5599
03:05:28,650 --> 03:05:31,030
With like gens and stuff, it's hard to do that.

5600
03:05:31,250 --> 03:05:31,630
That's true.

5601
03:05:31,650 --> 03:05:32,370
At the end zone.

5602
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:33,170
Yeah, that's true.

5603
03:05:33,450 --> 03:05:33,690
Yeah.

5604
03:05:33,790 --> 03:05:34,470
But like...

5605
03:05:34,630 --> 03:05:36,790
At the same time, like, it also kills and doesn't really matter, you know?

5606
03:05:36,870 --> 03:05:39,110
But like, then again, it is only flesh damage that matters.

5607
03:05:39,410 --> 03:05:39,750
It's just like, spacing.

5608
03:05:40,190 --> 03:05:40,770
Spacing-wise.

5609
03:05:41,590 --> 03:05:45,490
Yeah, I mean, Wasson's like insane to like, spam fences around.

5610
03:05:45,750 --> 03:05:48,430
Cause like, people can't shoot him, and people can't shoot your gen, you know?

5611
03:05:48,450 --> 03:05:49,130
You can literally play wherever.

5612
03:05:49,390 --> 03:05:49,410
Yeah.

5613
03:05:50,510 --> 03:05:52,410
You can play like, in the wide open.

5614
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:53,410
Like, everyone looking at you.

5615
03:05:53,910 --> 03:05:56,450
Alright, so we're gonna do Lifeline or Wraith then?

5616
03:05:56,610 --> 03:05:57,190
For Sage.

5617
03:05:59,350 --> 03:05:59,690
Um...

5618
03:06:01,290 --> 03:06:02,590
Mmm... That's a good question.

5619
03:06:02,590 --> 03:06:03,350
You made a good point.

5620
03:06:03,410 --> 03:06:04,910
Cause I think Valk will be really good.

5621
03:06:05,030 --> 03:06:05,910
Yeah, Valk for ending.

5622
03:06:06,170 --> 03:06:06,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5623
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:08,270
And then...

5624
03:06:08,790 --> 03:06:09,270
Uh...

5625
03:06:10,490 --> 03:06:12,810
I think Wattson and Valk 100%.

5626
03:06:12,810 --> 03:06:14,770
And then...

5627
03:06:14,770 --> 03:06:15,550
Mmm...

5628
03:06:16,650 --> 03:06:17,630
What do you think, Sage?

5629
03:06:20,350 --> 03:06:20,910
Sage die?

5630
03:06:20,910 --> 03:06:22,930
You think like Wraith, Portal, Valk or...

5631
03:06:24,630 --> 03:06:25,110
Lifeline?

5632
03:06:27,570 --> 03:06:28,050
Sage?

5633
03:06:28,170 --> 03:06:29,990
Okay, Sage is AFK at day...

5634
03:06:29,990 --> 03:06:31,610
I think she's AFK!

5635
03:06:32,670 --> 03:06:33,150
Yeah.

5636
03:06:34,150 --> 03:06:36,130
We'll wait for Sage to get back and...

5637
03:06:36,130 --> 03:06:37,790
We have plenty of time.

5638
03:06:38,330 --> 03:06:38,810
Yeah.

5639
03:06:41,090 --> 03:06:42,930
We have plenty of time to theorycraft.

5640
03:06:46,490 --> 03:06:48,510
How well have your games been?

5641
03:06:48,990 --> 03:06:49,630
So far?

5642
03:06:49,630 --> 03:06:50,050
Decent.

5643
03:06:50,150 --> 03:06:50,890
Middle of the pack.

5644
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:51,950
How about you?

5645
03:06:52,050 --> 03:06:52,370
Middle of the pack?

5646
03:06:52,930 --> 03:06:56,650
I think I got like two top 5's in the beginning and then I peaked and then...

5647
03:06:57,190 --> 03:06:58,890
I peaked very early on.

5648
03:06:59,590 --> 03:07:00,490
And then...

5649
03:07:00,490 --> 03:07:02,570
Ever since then, it's not been great.

5650
03:07:02,750 --> 03:07:05,130
Ever since then, Tempo has definitely rigged it against me.

5651
03:07:05,570 --> 03:07:06,010
Yeah.

5652
03:07:06,710 --> 03:07:07,850
Putting us in...

5653
03:07:07,850 --> 03:07:09,450
in the assault category.

5654
03:07:10,630 --> 03:07:12,190
Oh, that... yeah, that was horrible.

5655
03:07:12,310 --> 03:07:13,410
I think that was the turn...

5656
03:07:13,410 --> 03:07:16,230
My turning point was when I dropped AFK for Duos.

5657
03:07:16,690 --> 03:07:17,130
And...

5658
03:07:19,350 --> 03:07:20,230
And then...

5659
03:07:20,230 --> 03:07:22,210
I got ratted out instantly.

5660
03:07:23,710 --> 03:07:24,310
No way.

5661
03:07:24,470 --> 03:07:25,350
How did he go AFK?

5662
03:07:25,750 --> 03:07:27,990
He was getting his chicken and rice.

5663
03:07:28,110 --> 03:07:29,050
He was getting his dinner.

5664
03:07:29,390 --> 03:07:30,090
And then...

5665
03:07:30,490 --> 03:07:31,990
And then I... I got...

5666
03:07:31,990 --> 03:07:35,810
I walked up, did not see a full team in front of me and died!

5667
03:07:36,630 --> 03:07:37,350
Oh my gosh.

5668
03:07:37,590 --> 03:07:38,170
That stinks.

5669
03:07:40,310 --> 03:07:40,690
Oh!

5670
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:42,270
Is everybody waiting for me?

5671
03:07:42,730 --> 03:07:43,750
No, that's not it.

5672
03:07:43,790 --> 03:07:44,270
Where am I?

5673
03:07:44,430 --> 03:07:45,170
No, I'm not.

5674
03:07:45,350 --> 03:07:46,030
I was on the game.

5675
03:07:46,130 --> 03:07:46,130
Team 14.

5676
03:07:46,230 --> 03:07:47,190
No, what the fuck?

5677
03:07:47,230 --> 03:07:48,370
I was already in Team 14!

5678
03:07:49,570 --> 03:07:49,950
What?

5679
03:07:49,970 --> 03:07:51,170
Did they say something to you?

5680
03:07:51,170 --> 03:07:53,030
My chat was like, they're waiting for you.

5681
03:07:53,110 --> 03:07:53,870
And I was like, what?

5682
03:07:54,590 --> 03:07:55,690
I didn't even realize.

5683
03:07:56,290 --> 03:07:57,210
I didn't even see that.

5684
03:07:58,250 --> 03:07:59,710
I wasn't even in Team 5!

5685
03:07:59,710 --> 03:07:59,710
Yeah, Team 5.

5686
03:08:00,490 --> 03:08:01,970
I'm not even the last person!

5687
03:08:02,950 --> 03:08:04,190
There's a Team 5!

5688
03:08:09,910 --> 03:08:11,570
Did we claim down Beast already?

5689
03:08:12,430 --> 03:08:12,950
Yeah.

5690
03:08:12,950 --> 03:08:13,790
Yep, we got it.

5691
03:08:13,890 --> 03:08:15,270
I believe unconfessed.

5692
03:08:15,410 --> 03:08:16,310
Alright, nice.

5693
03:08:17,770 --> 03:08:18,290
Oh,

5694
03:08:23,280 --> 03:08:24,240
they forced moved me.

5695
03:08:24,480 --> 03:08:26,360
Alright, but I still wasn't the last person.

5696
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:28,200
I wasn't holding it up.

5697
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:29,600
I wasn't holding it up.

5698
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:31,160
They were people.

5699
03:08:31,620 --> 03:08:33,460
The Zyneful and Gengar...

5700
03:08:33,460 --> 03:08:34,240
Okay, it's alright.

5701
03:08:34,380 --> 03:08:35,360
It's fisting around.

5702
03:08:35,540 --> 03:08:36,280
So it doesn't matter.

5703
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:39,360
I'm lowkey.

5704
03:08:40,220 --> 03:08:41,220
I think they're actually moving.

5705
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:42,460
I'm gonna look around for Crypto.

5706
03:08:42,540 --> 03:08:43,540
Actually, they won't be on it yet.

5707
03:08:43,740 --> 03:08:44,040
Hello.

5708
03:08:45,060 --> 03:08:47,520
Did you say, um, so yes to Lifeline?

5709
03:08:47,620 --> 03:08:48,640
Was there anything else you talked about?

5710
03:08:48,660 --> 03:08:51,440
Oh yeah, if you wanna do Lifeline or Wraith, which would you prefer?

5711
03:08:53,180 --> 03:08:53,900
Probably Wraith.

5712
03:08:55,220 --> 03:08:56,260
Okay, I'm not a giant.

5713
03:08:56,440 --> 03:08:58,680
But if you want to be...

5714
03:08:58,680 --> 03:09:01,900
Yeah, she could save her Q for the final zone.

5715
03:09:02,620 --> 03:09:04,640
Yeah, that could be a whole other thing too.

5716
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:04,820
Yeah.

5717
03:09:05,940 --> 03:09:11,120
It's sort of like up in the air with like if Lifeline self-revive or Wraith's portal will stall longer than the other, you know?

5718
03:09:11,220 --> 03:09:12,380
I feel like the Wraith...

5719
03:09:12,380 --> 03:09:18,040
Cause like if she gets knocked out outside a zone when it's tiny, then like that'd be fucked for her.

5720
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:18,560
Yeah.

5721
03:09:20,540 --> 03:09:24,980
I just... like if there's a Crypto that would be good for us.

5722
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:25,600
But...

5723
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:28,920
Cause that would like help everyone sort of just...

5724
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:29,660
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

5725
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:31,960
Someone must go Crypto.

5726
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:35,020
There must be somebody on the enemy team that's gonna go Crypto.

5727
03:09:35,080 --> 03:09:35,700
There's no way.

5728
03:09:35,800 --> 03:09:40,460
After what happened in the first game, I refuse to believe no one's gonna go Crypto.

5729
03:09:40,740 --> 03:09:41,200
Yeah.

5730
03:09:41,280 --> 03:09:44,980
Unless everyone's thinking the same thing we are and we're like Yeah, there's gonna be someone that's Crypto.

5731
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:45,420
Totally.

5732
03:09:46,520 --> 03:09:47,940
There has to be.

5733
03:09:48,260 --> 03:09:51,240
But there's like so many of us here.

5734
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:52,160
There's so many.

5735
03:09:52,200 --> 03:09:54,620
There's no way one person's not gonna pick Crypto.

5736
03:09:54,620 --> 03:09:55,400
We just need one guy.

5737
03:09:55,580 --> 03:09:57,680
We literally need one guy to Crypto out.

5738
03:09:59,180 --> 03:10:00,940
Oh, Spikes would be good actually.

5739
03:10:02,360 --> 03:10:02,800
Oh.

5740
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:04,640
What about Catalyst with Cat Spikes?

5741
03:10:05,440 --> 03:10:06,680
Someone just mentioned that in my chat.

5742
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:08,600
Catalyst with Cat Spikes?

5743
03:10:09,100 --> 03:10:10,340
Like Final Final as well.

5744
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:11,240
Like Final Final?

5745
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:14,020
Yeah, but does Watson all eat it?

5746
03:10:14,080 --> 03:10:14,320
Or no?

5747
03:10:15,860 --> 03:10:16,300
Yeah.

5748
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:17,020
It does.

5749
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:18,400
Wait, wait, wait.

5750
03:10:18,780 --> 03:10:19,220
Watson.

5751
03:10:19,260 --> 03:10:20,520
Okay, I almost couldn't find Watson.

5752
03:10:20,560 --> 03:10:20,960
Yeah.

5753
03:10:22,800 --> 03:10:23,620
You're already on Watson.

5754
03:10:23,700 --> 03:10:24,100
You're chillin'.

5755
03:10:24,100 --> 03:10:24,600
Oh, nice.

5756
03:10:24,700 --> 03:10:25,060
Thank god.

5757
03:10:26,340 --> 03:10:29,000
I feel like Watson all eats Catalyst stuff, right?

5758
03:10:29,320 --> 03:10:30,100
Yeah, you're right.

5759
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:30,420
You're right.

5760
03:10:31,960 --> 03:10:32,120
It doesn't matter.

5761
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:35,760
We had a Fuse and it didn't matter because there were so many Watson ults.

5762
03:10:35,780 --> 03:10:36,440
There were so many.

5763
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:39,680
Yeah, I should've thought about that too because we had a Fuse too.

5764
03:10:40,500 --> 03:10:41,920
We were like Fuse...

5765
03:10:42,560 --> 03:10:43,120
What were we?

5766
03:10:43,160 --> 03:10:43,980
Fuse, Watson...

5767
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:46,880
Lifeline I think actually.

5768
03:10:47,220 --> 03:10:47,580
Yeah.

5769
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:51,140
I think the Fuse ult doesn't get ate by Watson gen unless I'm trippin'.

5770
03:10:51,140 --> 03:10:52,800
I think that's why people are trying to Fuse.

5771
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:53,940
We're not beasts by the way.

5772
03:10:54,780 --> 03:10:55,140
Alright.

5773
03:10:55,140 --> 03:10:55,500
Okay.

5774
03:10:55,980 --> 03:10:56,680
Here we go.

5775
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:57,120
Ready, out.

5776
03:10:57,140 --> 03:10:57,660
Here we go.

5777
03:10:57,680 --> 03:10:59,820
I am so bad with... yeah.

5778
03:11:00,540 --> 03:11:01,680
You might want to take...

5779
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:03,500
You might want to take off from me.

5780
03:11:03,740 --> 03:11:04,940
I'm really bad with landing.

5781
03:11:05,480 --> 03:11:06,280
Oh no, you're Chon.

5782
03:11:06,380 --> 03:11:06,640
You're Chon.

5783
03:11:06,740 --> 03:11:07,760
We shouldn't be contested.

5784
03:11:08,420 --> 03:11:08,780
Yeah.

5785
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:09,480
There's no way.

5786
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:12,480
They saw Nottie's game on there and they're like we wouldn't contest him.

5787
03:11:12,720 --> 03:11:13,960
Yeah, I'm not punchin' him.

5788
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:14,780
Punch out.

5789
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:16,060
Yeah, they're like, oh fuck it's Nottie.

5790
03:11:16,700 --> 03:11:17,320
Here, I'll land.

5791
03:11:17,360 --> 03:11:17,740
I'll land far.

5792
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:18,420
Alright.

5793
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:19,500
One of you guys can land like close.

5794
03:11:20,880 --> 03:11:23,000
I'll grab the other side of down beast.

5795
03:11:23,280 --> 03:11:24,340
Or I'll grab inside down beast.

5796
03:11:24,740 --> 03:11:25,580
Yep, that's perfect.

5797
03:11:26,420 --> 03:11:26,780
Okay.

5798
03:11:26,900 --> 03:11:28,120
So you can have the outside.

5799
03:11:29,820 --> 03:11:30,440
The crust.

5800
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:32,080
Yay.

5801
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:36,300
Where are people?

5802
03:11:36,400 --> 03:11:36,680
Right here.

5803
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:38,400
Oh, they're right here, right here.

5804
03:11:38,600 --> 03:11:39,260
Oh, they have the car.

5805
03:11:39,420 --> 03:11:40,120
They just grabbed that car.

5806
03:11:40,440 --> 03:11:41,580
That's fine, we don't need it.

5807
03:11:42,300 --> 03:11:43,280
Yeah, we'll be Chon.

5808
03:11:43,280 --> 03:11:43,420
My range is short circuited.

5809
03:11:43,420 --> 03:11:45,340
We're gonna be looking around for caches and stuff.

5810
03:11:45,500 --> 03:11:48,160
Wait, actually, maybe we do need it.

5811
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:50,520
I might get this car over here, I'm not gonna lie.

5812
03:11:51,460 --> 03:11:53,560
Oh wait, I think... Three right next to each other.

5813
03:11:53,700 --> 03:11:54,240
That's so pretty.

5814
03:11:54,740 --> 03:11:58,020
I like subconsciously picked up guns because we were shooting.

5815
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:01,300
Yeah, I got like really excited when I saw the vault.

5816
03:12:03,540 --> 03:12:03,940
Yes.

5817
03:12:04,220 --> 03:12:05,380
We're getting this car, we're Chon.

5818
03:12:05,660 --> 03:12:06,380
You have a car?

5819
03:12:06,900 --> 03:12:08,060
Yeah, I got the mill car.

5820
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:09,540
Okay, I got an evac.

5821
03:12:09,900 --> 03:12:11,120
If anyone wants this.

5822
03:12:16,330 --> 03:12:17,610
Oh my god, I just...

5823
03:12:18,630 --> 03:12:21,190
I just realized I threw away my shield cells.

5824
03:12:22,470 --> 03:12:23,210
Yeah, you can't even take guns.

5825
03:12:23,210 --> 03:12:23,410
Okay.

5826
03:12:24,650 --> 03:12:26,590
Alright, ulti cells are huge in this one, too.

5827
03:12:26,910 --> 03:12:29,610
I have no ulti cells.

5828
03:12:30,310 --> 03:12:31,410
I'm gonna carry all of them.

5829
03:12:33,190 --> 03:12:34,610
Also gotta make sure we have this car.

5830
03:12:34,730 --> 03:12:35,590
Oh wait, what do I need this for?

5831
03:12:35,790 --> 03:12:37,410
Make sure nobody steals it.

5832
03:12:37,550 --> 03:12:39,530
There's a lot of thermites and stuff here.

5833
03:12:39,830 --> 03:12:41,870
Isn't there evac if anyone wants it?

5834
03:12:42,310 --> 03:12:43,470
I already have an evac.

5835
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:48,670
Let's definitely start going for caches.

5836
03:12:49,770 --> 03:12:50,470
Sooner than later.

5837
03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:52,910
There's an individual... Oh, they're stealing it!

5838
03:12:53,010 --> 03:12:53,370
No!

5839
03:12:54,150 --> 03:12:54,550
Caches?

5840
03:12:54,670 --> 03:12:55,810
I could probably punch them out.

5841
03:12:55,930 --> 03:12:56,510
They're by themselves.

5842
03:12:57,310 --> 03:12:58,410
I mean, caches are free.

5843
03:12:58,410 --> 03:12:58,810
If it's forever.

5844
03:12:59,730 --> 03:13:02,210
Yeah, get outta here.

5845
03:13:02,410 --> 03:13:03,310
Oh, nevermind.

5846
03:13:03,450 --> 03:13:03,810
It's too...

5847
03:13:04,810 --> 03:13:08,150
It's okay, just if you get punched out, we can pick you up.

5848
03:13:10,610 --> 03:13:11,470
I'm coming over!

5849
03:13:12,890 --> 03:13:13,810
Are they chasing me?

5850
03:13:14,310 --> 03:13:15,070
Oh, they are, yeah.

5851
03:13:15,130 --> 03:13:15,850
They're actually chasing you.

5852
03:13:16,110 --> 03:13:16,870
What the fuck?

5853
03:13:17,130 --> 03:13:17,510
Freaks!

5854
03:13:18,110 --> 03:13:19,190
What are these freaks doing?

5855
03:13:19,650 --> 03:13:20,150
Don't worry.

5856
03:13:20,470 --> 03:13:21,590
Oh my gosh, the nades.

5857
03:13:21,610 --> 03:13:21,890
There's so many nades.

5858
03:13:22,710 --> 03:13:23,590
We're here, we're here.

5859
03:13:25,210 --> 03:13:26,550
This guy's actually trying to 3v3 us.

5860
03:13:26,770 --> 03:13:27,590
Wait, they took our car!

5861
03:13:27,710 --> 03:13:28,130
Get out!

5862
03:13:28,170 --> 03:13:28,330
No!

5863
03:13:28,550 --> 03:13:28,890
No, they're not!

5864
03:13:29,030 --> 03:13:29,370
Get out!

5865
03:13:29,930 --> 03:13:30,450
Get out!

5866
03:13:31,330 --> 03:13:31,790
They're broke.

5867
03:13:32,870 --> 03:13:33,950
Okay, I'm grabbing the car.

5868
03:13:35,510 --> 03:13:36,530
There's a thermite on it.

5869
03:13:36,570 --> 03:13:38,410
I don't know if it's theirs or mine.

5870
03:13:38,610 --> 03:13:39,290
Write this one, write this one.

5871
03:13:39,470 --> 03:13:40,810
I got the car, I got the car, I got the car!

5872
03:13:43,150 --> 03:13:44,630
He just ran over!

5873
03:13:45,010 --> 03:13:45,510
Punch him!

5874
03:13:45,510 --> 03:13:46,030
Punch him out!

5875
03:13:46,070 --> 03:13:46,510
Punch him out!

5876
03:13:46,590 --> 03:13:46,910
Nice!

5877
03:13:47,170 --> 03:13:47,490
Nice.

5878
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:50,770
That was a good Arcstar stack.

5879
03:13:50,970 --> 03:13:51,290
Nice.

5880
03:13:51,350 --> 03:13:51,570
Let's go.

5881
03:13:52,050 --> 03:13:52,870
That was huge.

5882
03:13:53,530 --> 03:13:53,850
Nice.

5883
03:13:54,810 --> 03:13:55,490
We should guide it.

5884
03:13:55,510 --> 03:13:55,870
Wait, wait, wait.

5885
03:13:55,870 --> 03:13:57,470
I'm gonna guide it with my fences.

5886
03:13:57,830 --> 03:13:58,690
Oh yeah, yeah.

5887
03:14:00,290 --> 03:14:01,370
Watch that barrel.

5888
03:14:02,730 --> 03:14:03,170
Alright.

5889
03:14:04,030 --> 03:14:05,910
They want their buddies back.

5890
03:14:06,310 --> 03:14:08,110
That is free evo points right there.

5891
03:14:08,130 --> 03:14:09,450
They want their buddy back.

5892
03:14:10,830 --> 03:14:11,490
That's good.

5893
03:14:13,350 --> 03:14:14,950
I used all my nades that was on.

5894
03:14:14,950 --> 03:14:16,790
They gotta get through this fence.

5895
03:14:18,390 --> 03:14:19,430
Oh my gosh.

5896
03:14:19,450 --> 03:14:21,090
No, they really tried to steal the car.

5897
03:14:21,110 --> 03:14:21,890
That was so funny.

5898
03:14:23,410 --> 03:14:24,370
Are they still here?

5899
03:14:24,370 --> 03:14:25,850
Oh, this game is so intense.

5900
03:14:26,030 --> 03:14:26,730
They might be.

5901
03:14:27,650 --> 03:14:29,090
Wait, we should grab that phoenix kit first.

5902
03:14:29,110 --> 03:14:30,330
They took the cannon, right?

5903
03:14:30,530 --> 03:14:31,370
Yeah, they took the cannon.

5904
03:14:31,950 --> 03:14:32,950
They might come back.

5905
03:14:33,130 --> 03:14:35,830
We should grab some armor stuff though.

5906
03:14:36,090 --> 03:14:36,770
We can drive them.

5907
03:14:38,350 --> 03:14:40,670
We can do the ring too for extra.

5908
03:14:40,910 --> 03:14:41,350
Oh, sorry.

5909
03:14:41,470 --> 03:14:41,810
I'm in.

5910
03:14:41,950 --> 03:14:42,430
No, you're good.

5911
03:14:43,450 --> 03:14:45,990
I need some nades too, so I'm just trying to like, a little more.

5912
03:14:48,190 --> 03:14:50,650
And then we'll do like a ring console nades and stuff.

5913
03:14:50,910 --> 03:14:52,270
My fences are still there.

5914
03:14:54,370 --> 03:14:55,710
So like, I don't know.

5915
03:14:55,730 --> 03:14:56,850
Maybe they're crafting him back?

5916
03:14:56,990 --> 03:14:57,290
Maybe.

5917
03:14:57,590 --> 03:14:58,230
Oh, they're bringing him back.

5918
03:14:58,250 --> 03:15:00,170
Oh, wait, they brought him back?

5919
03:15:00,210 --> 03:15:00,630
Yeah, they did.

5920
03:15:03,050 --> 03:15:03,670
I'm ready now.

5921
03:15:03,750 --> 03:15:03,930
No way.

5922
03:15:05,510 --> 03:15:06,150
Where are they?

5923
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:08,810
Where are they?

5924
03:15:09,370 --> 03:15:09,890
They're right here.

5925
03:15:10,970 --> 03:15:11,730
I'm out of punch design.

5926
03:15:12,970 --> 03:15:13,890
He's not laying on the cannon.

5927
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:18,700
Oh, they ulted.

5928
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:20,900
Back out, back out.

5929
03:15:22,420 --> 03:15:22,920
Backing out.

5930
03:15:23,460 --> 03:15:24,060
Get the car.

5931
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:24,260
They took the car.

5932
03:15:24,260 --> 03:15:24,640
No, we got the car.

5933
03:15:24,760 --> 03:15:25,080
Yeah!

5934
03:15:26,780 --> 03:15:28,080
Oh, they went through your fences.

5935
03:15:28,800 --> 03:15:29,920
I'm going up to the car.

5936
03:15:29,960 --> 03:15:30,440
I'm going up to the car.

5937
03:15:31,120 --> 03:15:32,140
They took the car.

5938
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:35,180
He actually has a car.

5939
03:15:36,680 --> 03:15:37,860
I can't believe it.

5940
03:15:37,900 --> 03:15:39,620
They actually, we got baited.

5941
03:15:40,300 --> 03:15:40,820
Alright, alright.

5942
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:41,540
We're gonna let him go.

5943
03:15:41,620 --> 03:15:41,900
We'll let him go.

5944
03:15:42,060 --> 03:15:42,580
Yeah, we should.

5945
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:43,400
Yeah, yeah.

5946
03:15:43,440 --> 03:15:44,280
We should grab.

5947
03:15:44,460 --> 03:15:48,100
No, I feel like we really should grab, do like, more arm or something.

5948
03:15:48,120 --> 03:15:49,980
Oh my god, my heart sank.

5949
03:15:50,020 --> 03:15:51,340
I thought that was a different team coming in.

5950
03:15:51,720 --> 03:15:54,060
Yeah, let's go get this cashier.

5951
03:15:54,320 --> 03:15:54,760
Ignore this.

5952
03:15:56,760 --> 03:15:57,760
It's a beautiful win.

5953
03:15:57,880 --> 03:15:59,120
It was in your honor, actually.

5954
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:01,400
Yeah, I wanna grab some armor cash.

5955
03:16:01,880 --> 03:16:04,120
We'll take this back and then go get this cash up top.

5956
03:16:04,340 --> 03:16:05,440
I can't believe they actually did it.

5957
03:16:05,440 --> 03:16:07,140
The zone should probably go that way.

5958
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:08,500
No, that was a good play.

5959
03:16:08,600 --> 03:16:09,040
I'm not gonna lie.

5960
03:16:09,140 --> 03:16:11,540
I didn't even think about bringing the card back close to them.

5961
03:16:12,120 --> 03:16:12,700
Not, yeah.

5962
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:13,360
Oh my god.

5963
03:16:16,630 --> 03:16:18,490
If I had another arc, he's not getting in that though.

5964
03:16:19,290 --> 03:16:19,870
Yeah, I know.

5965
03:16:19,890 --> 03:16:20,190
Same.

5966
03:16:20,290 --> 03:16:21,450
I didn't have any other arc.

5967
03:16:21,470 --> 03:16:22,870
I had only nades and...

5968
03:16:23,410 --> 03:16:25,690
I only had nades and thermites.

5969
03:16:27,110 --> 03:16:27,830
The madman.

5970
03:16:28,670 --> 03:16:29,490
Dyn is tripping.

5971
03:16:29,890 --> 03:16:31,890
No, that was funny.

5972
03:16:34,450 --> 03:16:35,630
I'm gonna go the ring console.

5973
03:16:36,250 --> 03:16:36,790
Yep, yep.

5974
03:16:37,030 --> 03:16:40,290
Go for it right behind you.

5975
03:16:40,830 --> 03:16:43,430
We'll go this console and then that package is probably taken.

5976
03:16:44,010 --> 03:16:45,190
It's not taking it, what the heck.

5977
03:16:45,910 --> 03:16:46,310
Nice.

5978
03:16:47,030 --> 03:16:47,430
What's that?

5979
03:16:47,490 --> 03:16:48,270
Get the cash out of it, maybe?

5980
03:16:48,550 --> 03:16:48,950
Whoa!

5981
03:16:51,470 --> 03:16:51,870
What's that?

5982
03:16:52,370 --> 03:16:53,630
Oh, I forgot.

5983
03:16:54,170 --> 03:16:55,850
I put a ring in here.

5984
03:16:56,070 --> 03:16:56,510
People up here.

5985
03:16:57,110 --> 03:16:58,390
Let me know they're coming over.

5986
03:16:58,490 --> 03:16:59,950
I have a ring around me.

5987
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:00,930
Okay.

5988
03:17:01,030 --> 03:17:01,490
Yeah, it's okay.

5989
03:17:01,590 --> 03:17:02,210
No, you're good.

5990
03:17:03,250 --> 03:17:04,250
Alright, I got it.

5991
03:17:04,450 --> 03:17:07,450
We'll hit this again as well in 20 seconds.

5992
03:17:10,010 --> 03:17:10,370
Questing.

5993
03:17:10,590 --> 03:17:12,290
I dropped a nade if you guys want one.

5994
03:17:13,430 --> 03:17:15,290
It's a Watson, I think, up there.

5995
03:17:15,350 --> 03:17:16,910
On the tippity top of the building.

5996
03:17:17,050 --> 03:17:18,350
That you just walked into.

5997
03:17:18,510 --> 03:17:19,290
We should go over here.

5998
03:17:19,530 --> 03:17:20,290
Yeah, I'm leaving it.

5999
03:17:20,310 --> 03:17:20,590
I'm leaving it.

6000
03:17:23,630 --> 03:17:25,070
Hit the beacon again for the zone.

6001
03:17:25,170 --> 03:17:25,670
She's coming down.

6002
03:17:25,830 --> 03:17:26,310
She's right here.

6003
03:17:27,970 --> 03:17:28,510
Come back.

6004
03:17:28,670 --> 03:17:29,770
Maybe I'm tripping.

6005
03:17:29,990 --> 03:17:30,450
Where did she go?

6006
03:17:32,130 --> 03:17:32,930
Oh, she's...

6007
03:17:33,490 --> 03:17:34,990
Yeah, she's gone.

6008
03:17:35,890 --> 03:17:36,610
She was solo.

6009
03:17:37,530 --> 03:17:38,170
Solo Della.

6010
03:17:38,950 --> 03:17:40,550
Oh, she was serious about getting out.

6011
03:17:41,270 --> 03:17:42,710
We should go grab this armor.

6012
03:17:43,510 --> 03:17:43,910
Yep.

6013
03:17:45,390 --> 03:17:46,090
Let's get this one.

6014
03:17:47,430 --> 03:17:48,550
Let's save that evac.

6015
03:17:48,850 --> 03:17:49,390
Actually, you know what?

6016
03:17:49,430 --> 03:17:50,310
Pop the evac up here.

6017
03:17:50,870 --> 03:17:51,610
I'm gonna debate it.

6018
03:17:51,890 --> 03:17:52,670
You baited me.

6019
03:17:53,630 --> 03:17:53,870
I'm gonna fly back.

6020
03:17:54,050 --> 03:17:55,730
I have to take this fucking zip.

6021
03:17:56,290 --> 03:17:56,790
You're John.

6022
03:17:58,190 --> 03:17:59,790
We'll call our evac up top here.

6023
03:17:59,870 --> 03:18:00,470
And just fly on that.

6024
03:18:00,610 --> 03:18:02,710
And then we'll go through to wall.

6025
03:18:03,750 --> 03:18:04,370
Okey doke.

6026
03:18:05,130 --> 03:18:06,410
We should get far from up here.

6027
03:18:07,730 --> 03:18:09,210
Wait, so did she actually open that?

6028
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:10,190
Yeah.

6029
03:18:10,550 --> 03:18:11,430
Wanna put it here?

6030
03:18:12,250 --> 03:18:13,150
Let's put it on this roof.

6031
03:18:13,370 --> 03:18:15,430
I think this is the only way to do it.

6032
03:18:17,610 --> 03:18:19,070
To get over this checkpoint stuff.

6033
03:18:20,830 --> 03:18:21,390
Here you go.

6034
03:18:24,610 --> 03:18:26,450
And then we do wanna get that one too.

6035
03:18:26,590 --> 03:18:27,790
I think we grab this one first.

6036
03:18:27,890 --> 03:18:29,030
And this choke and then get this one.

6037
03:18:29,150 --> 03:18:29,870
So we're all in purple.

6038
03:18:30,070 --> 03:18:30,710
We just fly this way.

6039
03:18:33,410 --> 03:18:33,770
Nice.

6040
03:18:33,770 --> 03:18:34,130
Perfect.

6041
03:18:34,830 --> 03:18:35,730
Yay, we lived.

6042
03:18:36,910 --> 03:18:38,810
I could meet you guys too back here.

6043
03:18:39,050 --> 03:18:41,090
If you wanna chill around here.

6044
03:18:41,650 --> 03:18:43,190
Not like full split but...

6045
03:18:43,190 --> 03:18:44,310
I'm just grabbing this cache.

6046
03:18:45,090 --> 03:18:47,270
We'll just start our way over there.

6047
03:18:47,390 --> 03:18:48,590
I'm gonna grab this other cache too.

6048
03:18:48,730 --> 03:18:48,870
Yeah.

6049
03:18:48,870 --> 03:18:49,730
Grab this guy.

6050
03:18:50,310 --> 03:18:51,750
We should split up there.

6051
03:18:53,870 --> 03:18:54,510
That's okay.

6052
03:18:54,990 --> 03:18:56,150
I'm on the way to you guys now.

6053
03:18:57,270 --> 03:18:58,790
I got my kunai on me.

6054
03:18:59,770 --> 03:19:00,770
Grabbing the other cache.

6055
03:19:01,250 --> 03:19:02,050
Which way are we going?

6056
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:05,350
We're gonna try and get into a spot.

6057
03:19:05,910 --> 03:19:07,110
It's gonna pull it back here.

6058
03:19:07,130 --> 03:19:07,530
I'm pretty sure somebody has to be here.

6059
03:19:07,710 --> 03:19:09,670
Yeah, probably.

6060
03:19:10,230 --> 03:19:11,330
It's gonna definitely pull back there.

6061
03:19:11,450 --> 03:19:12,550
I mean we can literally play anything.

6062
03:19:12,830 --> 03:19:14,090
Just next to somebody now.

6063
03:19:15,930 --> 03:19:18,550
Wait, so what's fast phase?

6064
03:19:20,010 --> 03:19:21,250
You phase faster?

6065
03:19:22,110 --> 03:19:25,150
You mean like the little time sign you do?

6066
03:19:25,290 --> 03:19:26,650
The phasing like...

6067
03:19:26,650 --> 03:19:28,550
Can we try to see if there's...

6068
03:19:28,990 --> 03:19:29,970
people up here?

6069
03:19:30,930 --> 03:19:32,190
Yeah, I'm gonna...

6070
03:19:32,190 --> 03:19:33,250
I feel like the wraith should, right?

6071
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:34,470
Yeah, the wraith definitely should.

6072
03:19:35,830 --> 03:19:37,670
Go up there, I believe in you.

6073
03:19:41,260 --> 03:19:42,000
There's another evac.

6074
03:19:42,160 --> 03:19:42,560
I have another evac.

6075
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:44,020
Okay, nice.

6076
03:19:44,220 --> 03:19:44,620
It's huge.

6077
03:19:48,300 --> 03:19:48,880
Is it good?

6078
03:19:48,980 --> 03:19:49,180
Is it safe?

6079
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:50,660
Yeah, it's super safe.

6080
03:19:53,220 --> 03:19:55,360
Yeah, fence this and then people can't even get up here.

6081
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:56,420
Just like put a little fence there.

6082
03:19:56,500 --> 03:19:57,360
But we're gonna keep going.

6083
03:19:59,980 --> 03:20:01,980
We're gonna try and get like inside the...

6084
03:20:01,980 --> 03:20:02,380
Oh, they are.

6085
03:20:02,580 --> 03:20:03,580
They're having nades right here though.

6086
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:04,480
Okay.

6087
03:20:04,620 --> 03:20:04,940
Alright.

6088
03:20:06,900 --> 03:20:08,680
We're gonna literally just run up on the bridge.

6089
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:09,500
Just play up top.

6090
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:11,340
We gotta wait for Doki though.

6091
03:20:11,520 --> 03:20:11,880
Come here.

6092
03:20:12,240 --> 03:20:12,560
Okay.

6093
03:20:14,600 --> 03:20:16,640
So there's a team like in the middle and then there's a team right there.

6094
03:20:16,720 --> 03:20:17,220
Yep, yep.

6095
03:20:17,340 --> 03:20:18,300
Just run up to me.

6096
03:20:18,300 --> 03:20:19,560
We're just gonna run up to us.

6097
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:20,740
I knew like we're safe.

6098
03:20:20,820 --> 03:20:21,300
There's a crypto.

6099
03:20:22,300 --> 03:20:23,480
We're so fucking safe.

6100
03:20:24,240 --> 03:20:24,760
That is awesome.

6101
03:20:24,980 --> 03:20:25,640
Oh my god.

6102
03:20:26,100 --> 03:20:27,120
That's so huge for us.

6103
03:20:27,460 --> 03:20:28,220
Yep, that's fine.

6104
03:20:28,320 --> 03:20:28,620
Come here, come here.

6105
03:20:28,780 --> 03:20:30,240
We gotta be like on Doki.

6106
03:20:30,380 --> 03:20:31,480
Get rid of the gem somewhere.

6107
03:20:31,560 --> 03:20:31,980
I'll tell you where.

6108
03:20:32,280 --> 03:20:32,600
Alright.

6109
03:20:33,240 --> 03:20:34,140
Probably right in this corner.

6110
03:20:34,580 --> 03:20:35,700
There's a team here, isn't there?

6111
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:37,680
Actually, put it here.

6112
03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:38,020
Put it here.

6113
03:20:38,520 --> 03:20:39,140
Alright, here?

6114
03:20:39,720 --> 03:20:40,040
Yeah.

6115
03:20:42,040 --> 03:20:43,300
Just get a bunch of fences.

6116
03:20:43,300 --> 03:20:46,060
This is our zone now, fucker.

6117
03:20:46,400 --> 03:20:47,360
We make our...

6118
03:20:47,360 --> 03:20:48,420
Our space.

6119
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,140
Yep.

6120
03:20:53,360 --> 03:20:54,280
Oh my gosh.

6121
03:20:54,360 --> 03:20:54,740
Is that the...

6122
03:20:54,740 --> 03:20:55,960
Is that them?

6123
03:20:56,160 --> 03:20:56,860
No, no way.

6124
03:20:57,560 --> 03:21:00,480
How far are you from purple, Doki?

6125
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:01,960
143.

6126
03:21:02,620 --> 03:21:03,060
Okay.

6127
03:21:03,160 --> 03:21:04,260
You wanna just punch these people?

6128
03:21:04,360 --> 03:21:04,880
Try and get it?

6129
03:21:05,540 --> 03:21:06,500
No way, Neampy.

6130
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:07,340
No way!

6131
03:21:08,840 --> 03:21:10,080
And that didn't EMP theirs?

6132
03:21:10,200 --> 03:21:10,680
No way.

6133
03:21:10,900 --> 03:21:11,740
No way.

6134
03:21:12,740 --> 03:21:13,900
Alright, come over here, Sage.

6135
03:21:15,140 --> 03:21:16,420
Let's just like chill here without any...

6136
03:21:16,420 --> 03:21:17,060
Dang!

6137
03:21:17,220 --> 03:21:18,480
She slapped the hell out of me!

6138
03:21:18,680 --> 03:21:19,180
I'm so sorry.

6139
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:20,100
That's not Doki!

6140
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:23,580
Wait, this EMP...

6141
03:21:23,580 --> 03:21:24,460
This car didn't even break.

6142
03:21:24,720 --> 03:21:25,340
No, it didn't.

6143
03:21:25,340 --> 03:21:26,700
It didn't reach all the way over there.

6144
03:21:26,760 --> 03:21:28,240
It stopped like right here at this box.

6145
03:21:28,520 --> 03:21:29,520
So that was really ridiculous.

6146
03:21:30,660 --> 03:21:31,460
No way.

6147
03:21:33,460 --> 03:21:34,780
I can't believe it.

6148
03:21:40,390 --> 03:21:41,190
Our zone.

6149
03:21:41,210 --> 03:21:42,810
Yeah, the team just landed right on top of us.

6150
03:21:43,010 --> 03:21:43,350
Yep, yep.

6151
03:21:43,890 --> 03:21:45,310
I have ult in 34.

6152
03:21:46,490 --> 03:21:47,530
This team just hit the beacon.

6153
03:21:49,010 --> 03:21:49,390
Let's see where they go.

6154
03:21:50,250 --> 03:21:50,650
Okay.

6155
03:21:52,290 --> 03:21:53,170
They're just chillin' there.

6156
03:21:53,870 --> 03:21:55,630
Probably just gonna pull here, yeah.

6157
03:21:56,310 --> 03:21:58,090
Okay, we have all this space.

6158
03:21:58,230 --> 03:21:58,910
We should be fine.

6159
03:21:59,470 --> 03:21:59,870
Yep.

6160
03:22:01,250 --> 03:22:03,230
Here, you want a phoenix?

6161
03:22:03,250 --> 03:22:04,390
Oh, they're just fist fighting!

6162
03:22:04,530 --> 03:22:05,610
Wait, they're fighting right now!

6163
03:22:06,770 --> 03:22:08,010
They stole their car!

6164
03:22:08,270 --> 03:22:09,410
They stole their car!

6165
03:22:09,930 --> 03:22:10,470
No way!

6166
03:22:10,810 --> 03:22:12,630
Do you wanna hit them?

6167
03:22:13,150 --> 03:22:13,990
Do you wanna punch him?

6168
03:22:14,110 --> 03:22:14,930
Do you wanna get your purple?

6169
03:22:15,970 --> 03:22:17,390
Bro, I can't fucking do this.

6170
03:22:17,910 --> 03:22:19,230
Wait, I think this is your fence.

6171
03:22:19,430 --> 03:22:19,870
That's your fence.

6172
03:22:20,290 --> 03:22:21,290
Oh, it is your fence!

6173
03:22:21,550 --> 03:22:22,030
It is?

6174
03:22:22,070 --> 03:22:22,810
Oh, it is!

6175
03:22:22,830 --> 03:22:23,630
I can't tell!

6176
03:22:24,130 --> 03:22:24,950
You're like, uh...

6177
03:22:25,830 --> 03:22:27,230
There's so many fences!

6178
03:22:27,970 --> 03:22:29,230
I just saw red!

6179
03:22:30,890 --> 03:22:32,570
Oh my god, they took back the car!

6180
03:22:32,810 --> 03:22:33,390
Holy shit!

6181
03:22:34,930 --> 03:22:36,890
Here, come put like four fences here.

6182
03:22:37,010 --> 03:22:37,370
You know what I mean?

6183
03:22:37,470 --> 03:22:38,250
Like, put them across.

6184
03:22:38,690 --> 03:22:39,670
Make like a box here.

6185
03:22:39,990 --> 03:22:40,610
Is that designing it?

6186
03:22:40,770 --> 03:22:41,990
It is, yeah.

6187
03:22:41,990 --> 03:22:43,430
Yeah, make us a box right here.

6188
03:22:43,570 --> 03:22:45,950
Just like a... Bro, what the fuck is wrong with you?

6189
03:22:45,970 --> 03:22:47,010
Oh, they did something here.

6190
03:22:47,050 --> 03:22:51,070
What the fuck is wrong with you?

6191
03:22:51,090 --> 03:22:51,610
Fuck off!

6192
03:22:56,400 --> 03:22:56,980
Here we go.

6193
03:22:57,780 --> 03:22:59,320
Put like one in each corner here.

6194
03:22:59,520 --> 03:22:59,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6195
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:01,620
Make a little square.

6196
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:06,160
A little square.

6197
03:23:06,540 --> 03:23:06,860
Perfect.

6198
03:23:07,580 --> 03:23:08,840
Alright, are we staying under here then?

6199
03:23:09,360 --> 03:23:09,960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6200
03:23:10,460 --> 03:23:12,480
Bro, fuck off!

6201
03:23:13,740 --> 03:23:14,700
Design's trying to kidnap you!

6202
03:23:15,020 --> 03:23:15,720
Back up, back up, back up!

6203
03:23:16,400 --> 03:23:17,180
Oh, my god.

6204
03:23:17,240 --> 03:23:18,280
Oh, that's a good strat!

6205
03:23:18,960 --> 03:23:20,400
Let's make a kidnap thing.

6206
03:23:20,480 --> 03:23:23,180
Alright, put four fences and like a diagonal...

6207
03:23:23,180 --> 03:23:24,280
He's not happy!

6208
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:27,320
Oh my god.

6209
03:23:27,360 --> 03:23:27,840
Oh, you went through.

6210
03:23:27,940 --> 03:23:28,960
Yeah, you're gonna have to come back.

6211
03:23:29,100 --> 03:23:30,200
Yeah, I don't have fences here.

6212
03:23:30,640 --> 03:23:31,360
Right back.

6213
03:23:31,620 --> 03:23:32,420
Good shit.

6214
03:23:32,580 --> 03:23:33,180
That was great.

6215
03:23:34,700 --> 03:23:35,640
He's not happy.

6216
03:23:35,880 --> 03:23:36,340
Oh my god.

6217
03:23:38,840 --> 03:23:39,820
There's another team right here.

6218
03:23:40,240 --> 03:23:41,120
He's so weird.

6219
03:23:41,220 --> 03:23:42,220
Design is so weird.

6220
03:23:43,740 --> 03:23:44,360
Why is he mad?

6221
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:45,760
Oh, that's bad.

6222
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:46,420
Cue right away.

6223
03:23:46,460 --> 03:23:46,860
Cue right away.

6224
03:23:48,460 --> 03:23:49,360
After he said that.

6225
03:23:49,360 --> 03:23:49,760
Oh, it's a portal!

6226
03:23:49,880 --> 03:23:50,120
It's a portal!

6227
03:23:52,760 --> 03:23:54,420
After he said that too.

6228
03:23:55,220 --> 03:23:55,540
Whoa!

6229
03:23:56,240 --> 03:23:56,980
Oh my gosh.

6230
03:23:57,500 --> 03:23:58,480
My Discord crashed.

6231
03:23:59,380 --> 03:24:00,160
What the fuck?

6232
03:24:00,940 --> 03:24:02,380
Oh, my Discord crashed.

6233
03:24:02,480 --> 03:24:02,800
Whoa!

6234
03:24:03,640 --> 03:24:04,400
Oh, it crashed?

6235
03:24:04,620 --> 03:24:05,000
I didn't even know.

6236
03:24:05,020 --> 03:24:06,140
I was trying to tell you to put fences.

6237
03:24:06,520 --> 03:24:06,660
Yeah.

6238
03:24:06,660 --> 03:24:07,920
Where did you want me to put it?

6239
03:24:08,420 --> 03:24:11,460
Here, put four fences in a little diagonal thing.

6240
03:24:11,580 --> 03:24:12,360
So put one right here.

6241
03:24:12,360 --> 03:24:12,920
Okay.

6242
03:24:13,100 --> 03:24:15,240
And one corner and then one diagonal of it.

6243
03:24:16,220 --> 03:24:17,340
And then one like right here.

6244
03:24:18,460 --> 03:24:20,000
And then connect the two diagonal ones.

6245
03:24:21,320 --> 03:24:21,600
Weee.

6246
03:24:23,720 --> 03:24:24,280
And then...

6247
03:24:25,060 --> 03:24:25,620
Put one...

6248
03:24:26,480 --> 03:24:27,180
Wait, hold on.

6249
03:24:27,560 --> 03:24:28,560
Pick this one up right here.

6250
03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:29,400
This one?

6251
03:24:29,560 --> 03:24:29,780
Okay.

6252
03:24:30,020 --> 03:24:30,800
I'm like confusing you.

6253
03:24:30,860 --> 03:24:31,060
Yeah, yeah.

6254
03:24:31,300 --> 03:24:33,500
Put one fence... put like in a smaller square.

6255
03:24:33,700 --> 03:24:34,800
We're gonna try and do a kidnap thing.

6256
03:24:34,840 --> 03:24:34,980
Okay.

6257
03:24:36,140 --> 03:24:36,940
Wait, actually, you know what?

6258
03:24:37,020 --> 03:24:38,160
We should move for the zone, I think.

6259
03:24:38,560 --> 03:24:38,840
Okay.

6260
03:24:38,960 --> 03:24:39,240
Come over here.

6261
03:24:39,300 --> 03:24:39,560
Come over here.

6262
03:24:39,620 --> 03:24:39,860
Come to me.

6263
03:24:39,860 --> 03:24:40,020
Come to me.

6264
03:24:40,020 --> 03:24:40,820
You have gen?

6265
03:24:41,360 --> 03:24:41,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6266
03:24:43,020 --> 03:24:44,220
Hold on, I'm gonna see if up here is better.

6267
03:24:44,560 --> 03:24:45,300
Here, come up to me.

6268
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:46,100
Climb up to me.

6269
03:24:46,760 --> 03:24:47,040
Alright.

6270
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:47,320
Ooh.

6271
03:24:47,760 --> 03:24:48,300
Hello guys.

6272
03:24:48,740 --> 03:24:50,080
I got that car like right there.

6273
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:50,080
Climb up.

6274
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:50,340
Climb up to me.

6275
03:24:50,380 --> 03:24:50,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6276
03:24:50,860 --> 03:24:52,600
And then put your gen right here.

6277
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:53,280
Why?

6278
03:24:55,260 --> 03:24:55,840
It's here now.

6279
03:24:58,560 --> 03:24:59,200
Right here, right here.

6280
03:24:59,260 --> 03:25:00,020
We're punching everyone off.

6281
03:25:00,060 --> 03:25:00,340
Whoa.

6282
03:25:01,840 --> 03:25:03,060
Alright, this is our new spot.

6283
03:25:04,580 --> 03:25:05,160
Are you okay?

6284
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:05,420
It's okay?

6285
03:25:05,620 --> 03:25:06,060
Are you okay?

6286
03:25:06,860 --> 03:25:07,140
No.

6287
03:25:07,140 --> 03:25:08,480
They like ran me over with the car.

6288
03:25:08,580 --> 03:25:09,020
I couldn't move.

6289
03:25:09,260 --> 03:25:10,000
They were trying to jump.

6290
03:25:10,020 --> 03:25:10,700
They were trying to trap you with the car.

6291
03:25:10,860 --> 03:25:11,520
Oh my god.

6292
03:25:11,720 --> 03:25:11,920
Back up.

6293
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:15,100
Yeah, we're punching everybody off of us here.

6294
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:15,940
Alright, here we go.

6295
03:25:15,940 --> 03:25:16,540
Our spot now.

6296
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:18,620
This is like my mode.

6297
03:25:19,400 --> 03:25:21,660
This is all I'm good at in this game, actually.

6298
03:25:22,020 --> 03:25:23,740
Okay, but what if... Oh, they have a gen.

6299
03:25:24,480 --> 03:25:25,700
You could actually fence their car.

6300
03:25:25,840 --> 03:25:26,980
If you wanna get them stuck.

6301
03:25:28,540 --> 03:25:28,940
Okay.

6302
03:25:29,560 --> 03:25:31,620
I need to have my gen up now.

6303
03:25:31,940 --> 03:25:33,220
I can't get over here.

6304
03:25:33,580 --> 03:25:35,580
I'm 105 off evo.

6305
03:25:35,840 --> 03:25:37,480
We don't have any ulti cells, right guys?

6306
03:25:37,680 --> 03:25:39,160
No, no, no ulti.

6307
03:25:39,160 --> 03:25:39,360
Okay.

6308
03:25:40,180 --> 03:25:41,960
Let me know when you get your gen, Doki.

6309
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:44,500
Okay, I have a 27%.

6310
03:25:44,500 --> 03:25:45,420
Yep, yep.

6311
03:25:45,540 --> 03:25:47,580
Try and punch people for your evo if you can too.

6312
03:25:47,660 --> 03:25:48,220
I'm trying.

6313
03:25:48,260 --> 03:25:50,520
I'm punching this random guy.

6314
03:25:51,300 --> 03:25:53,100
When you're just punching the car, actually do something?

6315
03:25:53,360 --> 03:25:54,820
No way.

6316
03:25:57,500 --> 03:25:57,940
55.

6317
03:25:58,800 --> 03:25:59,600
Punching the car.

6318
03:26:00,720 --> 03:26:01,860
Getting my armor.

6319
03:26:02,080 --> 03:26:04,080
My 5% armor from the car.

6320
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:07,120
Oh my gosh.

6321
03:26:09,160 --> 03:26:10,400
Bro, slowly and surely.

6322
03:26:10,500 --> 03:26:11,100
This is crazy.

6323
03:26:13,240 --> 03:26:13,900
I got it.

6324
03:26:14,120 --> 03:26:14,720
I got it.

6325
03:26:14,740 --> 03:26:15,020
I got it.

6326
03:26:15,080 --> 03:26:15,460
I got it.

6327
03:26:15,540 --> 03:26:15,840
Nice.

6328
03:26:16,480 --> 03:26:18,000
I got the two pylons.

6329
03:26:18,780 --> 03:26:19,100
Okay.

6330
03:26:19,900 --> 03:26:20,220
Perfect.

6331
03:26:20,320 --> 03:26:20,500
Perfect.

6332
03:26:20,700 --> 03:26:21,720
Do you need a syringe?

6333
03:26:22,140 --> 03:26:22,460
No.

6334
03:26:22,500 --> 03:26:22,940
Oh wait.

6335
03:26:22,960 --> 03:26:23,100
Yeah.

6336
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:23,720
I'm gonna syringe.

6337
03:26:23,800 --> 03:26:24,260
Pop a syringe.

6338
03:26:24,300 --> 03:26:24,620
Pop a syringe.

6339
03:26:24,680 --> 03:26:25,340
Cause of the caustics.

6340
03:26:26,440 --> 03:26:27,480
I'm gonna fight the car.

6341
03:26:28,580 --> 03:26:32,060
Yeah, and in the final end game, Doki, you're just gonna spam fences everywhere.

6342
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:34,160
And then just like try and you know.

6343
03:26:34,920 --> 03:26:35,980
Connect them all and get them down.

6344
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:36,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6345
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:39,360
We're fine.

6346
03:26:39,440 --> 03:26:39,780
We're fine.

6347
03:26:41,340 --> 03:26:41,660
We're fine.

6348
03:26:41,660 --> 03:26:42,080
Oh my god.

6349
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:42,880
This is not fine.

6350
03:26:43,220 --> 03:26:44,180
I don't know actually.

6351
03:26:46,860 --> 03:26:47,420
Are you okay?

6352
03:26:47,580 --> 03:26:48,740
I don't even know how many fences.

6353
03:26:48,880 --> 03:26:49,080
Okay.

6354
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:49,340
Yeah.

6355
03:26:49,420 --> 03:26:49,600
I have.

6356
03:26:49,620 --> 03:26:50,260
I think I have maximum.

6357
03:26:50,280 --> 03:26:50,960
Oh, we have a nice spot.

6358
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:51,280
Let's go.

6359
03:26:51,760 --> 03:26:53,160
I have the maximum amount of fences.

6360
03:26:53,320 --> 03:26:53,760
Oh my god.

6361
03:26:53,780 --> 03:26:54,700
They destroyed my fences.

6362
03:26:56,400 --> 03:26:57,120
That's fucked up.

6363
03:26:58,380 --> 03:26:59,300
And that's why you're stunned.

6364
03:27:00,880 --> 03:27:01,480
Look at you.

6365
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:02,360
Look at you.

6366
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:05,640
Oh god.

6367
03:27:07,360 --> 03:27:08,440
Look at my fences.

6368
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:13,780
My fences.

6369
03:27:19,340 --> 03:27:19,780
Bro.

6370
03:27:19,780 --> 03:27:20,220
Bro.

6371
03:27:20,320 --> 03:27:22,880
They do not like your fences.

6372
03:27:23,060 --> 03:27:23,680
Wait, Doki.

6373
03:27:23,700 --> 03:27:25,100
Can you put some fences here?

6374
03:27:25,560 --> 03:27:26,000
Okay.

6375
03:27:26,040 --> 03:27:26,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6376
03:27:26,400 --> 03:27:26,800
From up top.

6377
03:27:27,020 --> 03:27:28,900
Just put like a bunch down here.

6378
03:27:29,220 --> 03:27:29,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6379
03:27:29,920 --> 03:27:32,540
They're just slowly coming up to us.

6380
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,820
What do I do?

6381
03:27:34,380 --> 03:27:35,820
They are actually trying to push us.

6382
03:27:35,820 --> 03:27:37,620
They're just slowly walking up.

6383
03:27:37,620 --> 03:27:38,220
Dude.

6384
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:41,780
This thing here too is like...

6385
03:27:42,320 --> 03:27:44,560
But that Watson looks like she's panicking.

6386
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:45,440
So I think it's okay.

6387
03:27:45,680 --> 03:27:48,280
Make sure you have like all 12 fences down around like everywhere.

6388
03:27:49,880 --> 03:27:50,200
Bro.

6389
03:27:50,200 --> 03:27:50,460
Bro.

6390
03:27:50,820 --> 03:27:51,140
Stop.

6391
03:27:56,020 --> 03:27:57,360
You're stealing our fences.

6392
03:27:57,580 --> 03:27:58,320
Oh, they broke the gen.

6393
03:27:58,980 --> 03:27:59,700
They broke our gen.

6394
03:27:59,940 --> 03:28:00,660
I have gen.

6395
03:28:00,680 --> 03:28:00,960
I have gen.

6396
03:28:01,060 --> 03:28:01,520
Do you want me to put gen down?

6397
03:28:01,520 --> 03:28:02,280
Come put it right here.

6398
03:28:02,280 --> 03:28:02,880
Come put gen on me.

6399
03:28:02,980 --> 03:28:03,560
Come put gen on me.

6400
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:03,880
Right here.

6401
03:28:04,020 --> 03:28:04,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6402
03:28:04,520 --> 03:28:04,620
Wait.

6403
03:28:04,660 --> 03:28:05,120
Actually hold it.

6404
03:28:05,140 --> 03:28:05,360
Hold it.

6405
03:28:05,360 --> 03:28:05,500
Hold it.

6406
03:28:05,560 --> 03:28:05,640
Hold it.

6407
03:28:05,640 --> 03:28:05,840
Hold it.

6408
03:28:06,620 --> 03:28:07,320
Hold your gen.

6409
03:28:07,320 --> 03:28:07,920
Hold your gen right here.

6410
03:28:08,780 --> 03:28:11,880
I have to heal.

6411
03:28:11,920 --> 03:28:12,180
You guys okay?

6412
03:28:12,720 --> 03:28:13,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6413
03:28:13,220 --> 03:28:13,660
I'm okay.

6414
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:13,960
I'm okay.

6415
03:28:14,120 --> 03:28:15,260
This caustic.

6416
03:28:15,260 --> 03:28:16,100
Oh, this team right here.

6417
03:28:16,600 --> 03:28:17,000
Put your gen down.

6418
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:17,460
Put your gen down.

6419
03:28:17,480 --> 03:28:17,800
We have to.

6420
03:28:18,340 --> 03:28:18,860
I'm putting.

6421
03:28:19,280 --> 03:28:19,780
I'm putting.

6422
03:28:19,880 --> 03:28:20,120
I'm putting.

6423
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:20,840
I might die.

6424
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:22,240
I'm gonna die.

6425
03:28:23,120 --> 03:28:24,360
Someone threw their ult on me.

6426
03:28:24,500 --> 03:28:25,240
I'm dead now.

6427
03:28:25,320 --> 03:28:25,720
I'm dead.

6428
03:28:25,720 --> 03:28:26,140
I'm dead.

6429
03:28:26,140 --> 03:28:26,400
They threw.

6430
03:28:26,620 --> 03:28:27,020
Yeah, yeah.

6431
03:28:27,200 --> 03:28:28,100
It's up to you, daddy.

6432
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:28,860
You gotta live.

6433
03:28:30,580 --> 03:28:31,560
There was too many.

6434
03:28:31,820 --> 03:28:33,260
Why did the crypto not ult?

6435
03:28:34,540 --> 03:28:35,200
There's no way.

6436
03:28:35,360 --> 03:28:35,880
I'm getting hushed.

6437
03:28:36,220 --> 03:28:37,160
Oh, crypto.

6438
03:28:37,340 --> 03:28:38,780
You have the chance.

6439
03:28:42,380 --> 03:28:45,680
I am impressed the crypto saved the ult for that long.

6440
03:28:46,020 --> 03:28:46,620
That.

6441
03:28:46,740 --> 03:28:47,980
Oh, no way.

6442
03:28:47,980 --> 03:28:48,860
I can't believe.

6443
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:51,160
Design head butted me.

6444
03:28:51,540 --> 03:28:53,940
He took the time to head butt me.

6445
03:28:54,140 --> 03:28:55,000
You know what?

6446
03:28:57,120 --> 03:28:58,220
This is crazy.

6447
03:28:58,600 --> 03:29:00,740
Now the crypto ults.

6448
03:29:00,740 --> 03:29:01,740
Oh my god.

6449
03:29:03,680 --> 03:29:04,500
Oh my gosh.

6450
03:29:04,520 --> 03:29:05,280
You can totally respawn.

6451
03:29:05,980 --> 03:29:06,600
Oh, yeah.

6452
03:29:06,700 --> 03:29:08,000
Yeah, you can totally do it.

6453
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:09,620
Yeah, the worst of them.

6454
03:29:09,720 --> 03:29:10,580
Oh my god.

6455
03:29:10,720 --> 03:29:12,400
There's actually a lot of cryptos now.

6456
03:29:12,520 --> 03:29:12,920
That's crazy.

6457
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:16,680
There were so many cryptos, but yet nobody crypto ulted.

6458
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:18,480
How the fuck was that?

6459
03:29:18,940 --> 03:29:19,660
They did not care.

6460
03:29:20,180 --> 03:29:21,120
That really sucks.

6461
03:29:21,940 --> 03:29:23,430
Yeah, that caustic was just...

6462
03:29:25,040 --> 03:29:26,620
Yeah, the caustic was so clutch.

6463
03:29:26,640 --> 03:29:26,900
Yeah, the caustic was so clutch.

6464
03:29:27,680 --> 03:29:29,390
I'm surprised that no one fucking...

6465
03:29:30,860 --> 03:29:33,840
I'm surprised that no watson ult ate that caustic ult.

6466
03:29:34,420 --> 03:29:35,340
I'm surprised that no watson ult ate that caustic ult.

6467
03:29:35,340 --> 03:29:37,820
That was in between three different watson ults.

6468
03:29:38,080 --> 03:29:39,220
How is that possible?

6469
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:41,360
It's okay.

6470
03:29:41,420 --> 03:29:42,120
Not last though.

6471
03:29:43,940 --> 03:29:45,520
You'll be 19th and you die.

6472
03:29:45,720 --> 03:29:46,240
That's fine.

6473
03:29:46,440 --> 03:29:48,580
Look at all the EMPs going off over there.

6474
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:49,800
Oh my god.

6475
03:29:50,080 --> 03:29:50,980
That is crazy.

6476
03:29:51,380 --> 03:29:53,940
If only we didn't lose our car.

6477
03:29:56,180 --> 03:29:57,400
But do you have your...

6478
03:29:57,400 --> 03:29:59,780
Do you have a redeploy or no?

6479
03:30:00,840 --> 03:30:01,740
I'm gonna valk ult.

6480
03:30:01,820 --> 03:30:02,040
Yeah, yeah.

6481
03:30:02,040 --> 03:30:02,820
Okay.

6482
03:30:04,580 --> 03:30:05,580
Oh my god.

6483
03:30:05,700 --> 03:30:06,520
Look at this.

6484
03:30:08,120 --> 03:30:09,880
It's gonna be hard to get it off but I'm gonna try.

6485
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:11,000
I gotta do it late though.

6486
03:30:17,140 --> 03:30:17,860
My god.

6487
03:30:19,060 --> 03:30:20,040
This is stressful.

6488
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:20,960
There's a world here.

6489
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:23,180
Where's the other crypto ult?

6490
03:30:25,860 --> 03:30:27,580
At least there's less fences.

6491
03:30:29,020 --> 03:30:29,700
Oh my god.

6492
03:30:29,720 --> 03:30:30,540
Master fighter banners.

6493
03:30:30,980 --> 03:30:31,940
Oh my god.

6494
03:30:31,940 --> 03:30:32,480
If only.

6495
03:30:32,780 --> 03:30:33,740
That would have been so clutch.

6496
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:35,300
Wait, they're resing it in front of you.

6497
03:30:36,500 --> 03:30:36,820
Behind.

6498
03:30:38,140 --> 03:30:38,880
They're literally there.

6499
03:30:38,960 --> 03:30:39,380
Look at them.

6500
03:30:39,680 --> 03:30:40,280
They're resing.

6501
03:30:41,620 --> 03:30:43,420
I gotta ignore that dude.

6502
03:30:49,940 --> 03:30:51,000
This is crazy.

6503
03:30:51,320 --> 03:30:52,440
Where's the other crypto ult?

6504
03:30:53,020 --> 03:30:54,820
Wait, you can take that E back.

6505
03:30:55,160 --> 03:30:55,800
In front of you.

6506
03:30:55,940 --> 03:30:56,100
Yeah, yeah.

6507
03:30:56,160 --> 03:30:56,520
Good come.

6508
03:30:56,780 --> 03:31:01,680
I have to keep my flesh health up though.

6509
03:31:04,100 --> 03:31:05,060
Oh my god.

6510
03:31:05,140 --> 03:31:06,020
Wait, sand on top of us.

6511
03:31:06,440 --> 03:31:07,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6512
03:31:07,120 --> 03:31:07,680
Sand on top of us.

6513
03:31:07,720 --> 03:31:08,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6514
03:31:09,300 --> 03:31:10,920
Don't make your presence known.

6515
03:31:10,940 --> 03:31:11,340
Just chill.

6516
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:12,060
Just chill.

6517
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:14,080
Go back up.

6518
03:31:14,120 --> 03:31:14,880
Go back up there.

6519
03:31:15,100 --> 03:31:15,960
This is the only...

6520
03:31:22,510 --> 03:31:23,710
Oh my god.

6521
03:31:23,830 --> 03:31:24,970
Oh my god.

6522
03:31:28,510 --> 03:31:29,730
Oh my god.

6523
03:31:31,130 --> 03:31:32,010
Get an E back.

6524
03:31:32,270 --> 03:31:32,710
E back.

6525
03:31:33,390 --> 03:31:34,590
It's not allowed to be valkled.

6526
03:31:34,630 --> 03:31:35,050
What the heck.

6527
03:31:42,500 --> 03:31:43,540
This is the...

6528
03:31:43,540 --> 03:31:44,080
What?

6529
03:31:44,680 --> 03:31:45,560
What happened?

6530
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:46,740
Wait, what just happened to me?

6531
03:31:46,740 --> 03:31:47,740
What happened?

6532
03:31:48,260 --> 03:31:49,220
I just got killpilled.

6533
03:31:49,580 --> 03:31:50,660
I think you valkled on somebody.

6534
03:31:50,720 --> 03:31:52,080
Like somebody was on your head.

6535
03:31:52,260 --> 03:31:54,340
Like another valk was on your head.

6536
03:31:54,440 --> 03:31:55,120
There's no way.

6537
03:31:55,240 --> 03:31:56,040
It was a nade?

6538
03:31:56,240 --> 03:31:58,220
He got naded on his head.

6539
03:31:58,280 --> 03:32:00,600
I actually would have won that game.

6540
03:32:00,860 --> 03:32:01,180
Bro!

6541
03:32:01,480 --> 03:32:04,060
You actually got hit on the head.

6542
03:32:04,140 --> 03:32:04,540
Bro!

6543
03:32:04,540 --> 03:32:04,540
You actually got hit on the head.

6544
03:32:04,540 --> 03:32:05,400
What the fuck?

6545
03:32:05,980 --> 03:32:07,480
There's no way.

6546
03:32:07,520 --> 03:32:09,500
You actually got goomba stomped.

6547
03:32:09,580 --> 03:32:11,140
That's fucking crazy.

6548
03:32:12,140 --> 03:32:14,760
It said I died to a vert nade, but I don't even think that happened.

6549
03:32:14,760 --> 03:32:15,540
I think I actually died.

6550
03:32:15,540 --> 03:32:17,440
It looked like somebody's box or something fell on you.

6551
03:32:17,440 --> 03:32:20,060
Yeah, somebody landed on you and you got crushed.

6552
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:22,100
That was actually crazy.

6553
03:32:22,100 --> 03:32:23,100
Wait, that is crazy.

6554
03:32:23,740 --> 03:32:25,220
Oh my god.

6555
03:32:25,260 --> 03:32:27,820
You actually got goomba stomped.

6556
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:28,480
It's terrible.

6557
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:31,380
I think I died midair as I was going up to a vert nade.

6558
03:32:31,380 --> 03:32:31,640
Yeah.

6559
03:32:32,860 --> 03:32:34,260
That is so unlucky.

6560
03:32:34,260 --> 03:32:34,880
That's so rough.

6561
03:32:36,380 --> 03:32:37,340
Nice try.

6562
03:32:37,840 --> 03:32:38,680
That would have been it.

6563
03:32:38,740 --> 03:32:40,400
That would have actually been a crazy comeback.

6564
03:32:40,940 --> 03:32:42,360
The goomba stomped.

6565
03:32:42,360 --> 03:32:43,240
Holy shit.

6566
03:32:43,680 --> 03:32:44,380
I still...

6567
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:48,340
There was barely any crypto alts for how many crypto players in the game.

6568
03:32:48,400 --> 03:32:48,660
Yeah.

6569
03:32:48,700 --> 03:32:49,500
There was.

6570
03:32:50,300 --> 03:32:51,680
That is wild.

6571
03:32:52,160 --> 03:32:53,340
Oh my god.

6572
03:32:53,620 --> 03:32:53,980
Wait, no.

6573
03:32:54,040 --> 03:32:58,380
There was two crypto players and I swear I only saw two crypto alts in the end.

6574
03:32:58,640 --> 03:32:59,060
Yeah.

6575
03:33:01,080 --> 03:33:01,640
Yeah.

6576
03:33:01,860 --> 03:33:02,480
GG's guys.

6577
03:33:02,580 --> 03:33:03,060
GG's.

6578
03:33:03,300 --> 03:33:03,860
GG's.

6579
03:33:05,400 --> 03:33:05,960
GG's.

6580
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:07,020
See you guys.

6581
03:33:07,200 --> 03:33:07,600
GG's.

6582
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:07,760
Yeah, bye.

6583
03:33:07,760 --> 03:33:07,920
Bye.

6584
03:33:09,320 --> 03:33:10,100
Holy shit.

6585
03:33:10,140 --> 03:33:11,040
That's actually crazy.

6586
03:33:11,260 --> 03:33:13,100
I can't believe he got goomba stomped.

6587
03:33:19,020 --> 03:33:20,340
Oh my god.

6588
03:33:20,700 --> 03:33:22,620
How is that possible?

6589
03:33:23,980 --> 03:33:26,520
Somebody was on top of him and then he died.

6590
03:33:31,040 --> 03:33:32,800
Oh my god.

6591
03:33:33,920 --> 03:33:35,260
How much money did we make?

6592
03:33:35,380 --> 03:33:36,500
I think we made like 1k.

6593
03:33:36,660 --> 03:33:37,480
More than 1k.

6594
03:33:37,560 --> 03:33:38,260
1.5k.

6595
03:33:38,600 --> 03:33:39,460
I'm pretty sure.

6596
03:33:39,600 --> 03:33:41,600
I think I made like 1.5k.

6597
03:33:42,260 --> 03:33:43,060
I'm pretty sure.

6598
03:33:43,160 --> 03:33:45,800
Because we had two top 5s and that was like $900.

6599
03:33:46,340 --> 03:33:46,940
I think.

6600
03:33:47,180 --> 03:33:48,600
I think that was like 900.

6601
03:33:50,260 --> 03:33:51,120
Wait, not 800.

6602
03:33:51,300 --> 03:33:51,600
Sorry.

6603
03:33:51,720 --> 03:33:52,560
Why did I say 900?

6604
03:33:52,960 --> 03:33:53,320
$800?

6605
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:56,060
And then we get the $500 entry fee.

6606
03:33:56,180 --> 03:33:57,300
So like when we're in there.

6607
03:33:57,500 --> 03:34:00,720
When you get in, you get $500 automatically by just playing.

6608
03:34:01,220 --> 03:34:05,060
And then like all the other games, I think add up would be 1.5.

6609
03:34:05,300 --> 03:34:07,680
And then like all the other games, I think add up would be 1.5.

6610
03:34:07,680 --> 03:34:07,880
And then like all the other games, I think add up would be 1.5.

6611
03:34:07,880 --> 03:34:08,700
I had a great time.

6612
03:34:08,940 --> 03:34:09,360
It was fun.

6613
03:34:09,600 --> 03:34:09,940
It was fun.

6614
03:34:10,140 --> 03:34:12,080
I definitely peaked in the beginning.

6615
03:34:13,220 --> 03:34:14,180
I definitely...

6616
03:34:16,280 --> 03:34:18,540
My gameplay peaked in the beginning.

6617
03:34:18,680 --> 03:34:20,700
And then it was downhill from there.

6618
03:34:20,860 --> 03:34:21,600
It gave...

6619
03:34:25,600 --> 03:34:27,920
Our placement went downhill from there.

6620
03:34:27,980 --> 03:34:30,240
But we got top 5 in two different games.

6621
03:34:31,880 --> 03:34:34,780
We got top 5 in two games in a row.

6622
03:34:35,020 --> 03:34:36,160
So it was a fun stream.

6623
03:34:36,300 --> 03:34:37,080
I had a really great time.

6624
03:34:37,080 --> 03:34:39,880
Meeting all these people.

6625
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:40,660
It was fun.

6626
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:42,620
I had a great time meeting everybody.

6627
03:34:43,260 --> 03:34:46,340
And it was fucking free money.

6628
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:48,260
And it was fucking free money.

6629
03:34:48,260 --> 03:34:49,240
We love free money.

6630
03:34:49,400 --> 03:34:49,800
Chat.

6631
03:34:50,040 --> 03:34:51,940
We love free money.

6632
03:34:52,140 --> 03:34:54,060
And that's all that matters.

6633
03:34:58,730 --> 03:35:00,050
And that's all that matters.

6634
03:35:00,050 --> 03:35:00,950
And that's all that matters.

6635
03:35:01,150 --> 03:35:02,230
And that's all that matters.

6636
03:35:03,590 --> 03:35:04,750
I'm gonna make sure.

6637
03:35:04,850 --> 03:35:07,590
If there's anything else we have to do.

6638
03:35:07,910 --> 03:35:08,530
But I'm gonna make sure.

6639
03:35:08,530 --> 03:35:09,490
I think we're good to go.

6640
03:35:09,690 --> 03:35:10,250
But yeah.

6641
03:35:10,350 --> 03:35:11,030
Thank you everybody.

6642
03:35:11,350 --> 03:35:13,930
I'm gonna do a guerrilla stream later on on YouTube.

6643
03:35:14,290 --> 03:35:15,770
I'm gonna figure out what I wanna do.

6644
03:35:16,090 --> 03:35:19,390
But I'll be doing another guerrilla stream later tonight.

6645
03:35:19,610 --> 03:35:21,170
And just hang out with all of you guys.

6646
03:35:22,090 --> 03:35:22,710
But yeah.

6647
03:35:22,930 --> 03:35:24,130
I hope you guys had a fun time.

6648
03:35:24,230 --> 03:35:24,750
Meeting everybody.

6649
03:35:25,850 --> 03:35:27,190
And talking to everyone.

6650
03:35:27,490 --> 03:35:30,250
And getting to know more from the Apex scene.

6651
03:35:30,610 --> 03:35:31,490
I had a great time.

6652
03:35:31,650 --> 03:35:33,070
That was my first time playing with Jen.

6653
03:35:33,630 --> 03:35:35,070
A great time meeting him.

6654
03:35:35,070 --> 03:35:36,750
And a great time.

6655
03:35:36,790 --> 03:35:38,070
First time playing with Timmy.

6656
03:35:38,110 --> 03:35:39,270
And a great time meeting him.

6657
03:35:39,330 --> 03:35:40,250
Except for that one time.

6658
03:35:40,350 --> 03:35:41,910
That I got confused with Sheila.

6659
03:35:47,490 --> 03:35:50,710
When he kept yelling at me about Sheila.

6660
03:35:53,510 --> 03:35:54,430
When he kept yelling at me about Sheila.

6661
03:35:54,430 --> 03:35:55,770
I had a great time though.

6662
03:35:55,790 --> 03:35:56,190
The queue.

6663
03:35:57,510 --> 03:35:57,970
Alright.

6664
03:36:02,610 --> 03:36:05,310
I am going to call it here.

6665
03:36:05,430 --> 03:36:05,910
As always everybody.

6666
03:36:08,250 --> 03:36:14,490
I'll see you guys next time.

6667
03:36:14,510 --> 03:36:15,670
Bye guys.

6668
03:36:16,050 --> 03:36:16,750
Bye.

6669
03:36:16,870 --> 03:36:17,470
Bye.

6670
03:36:17,890 --> 03:36:18,690
Bye.

6671
03:36:18,690 --> 03:36:19,470
Bye.

6672
03:36:19,470 --> 03:36:19,490
Bye.
