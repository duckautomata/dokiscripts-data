1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220
A

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:48,650
little pause...

3
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,400
and we are back.

4
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,460
A little pause... and we are back.

5
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,300
Hello, hello everybody!

6
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,420
Hey guys!

7
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,200
Hello everybody!

8
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,860

9
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,600

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,740

13
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,660
Or that's pinned in the comments.

14
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,720
It really does help a lot.

15
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,120
Because it helps, you know, encourages more sponsors in the future and everything.

16
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,760
So yeah!

17
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,200
Daniel Cookie Run Kingdom today!

18
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Even though you haven't seen me play it yet!

19
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,480
You know?

20
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,660
Just because you haven't seen me play it doesn't mean that's going to stop you from downloading it right now!

21
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,720
So you can play along with me, you know?

22
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,100
Play along with me guys!

23
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,460
But yes, again, a very huge shoutout again to Cookie Run for reaching out to me.

24
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:37,140
Especially because I've never... I've never... Yes, supporting your streamers blindly is the way to go.

25
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Good things always happen when you support somebody blindly with no evidence.

26
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,980
But you know I'm going to make this game look great!

27
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm also trying very hard not to swear because like this game is very... very...

28
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,080
very...

29
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,620
Dude, this game is way too cute to swear right now.

30
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,070
So I have my inner filters on.

31
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,830
Okay, let me bring down the music just a little bit and then we're good to go.

32
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,450
Alright!

33
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,530
So I've actually... I've actually never played Cookie Run before.

34
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,590
I've always seen a lot about this game.

35
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,650
And I know they have like a lot of different games.

36
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,750
This like... it has like a different types of games as well.

37
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,870
It's not just kingdoms.

38
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,330
But this is actually my very, very first time playing Cookie Run.

39
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,070
I always loved the designs of Cookie Run.

40
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,570
Like I've seen like... especially Cookie Run Kingdom.

41
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,610
I've always loved the designs because I mean...

42
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,750
This guy is so freaking cute.

43
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,330
I hesitated because I had to vote.

44
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,990
I almost went for it.

45
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,670
But apparently...

46
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,050
This cookie is called Cream Barret Cookie.

47
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,930
And they look really, really cute.

48
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,570
And I always think like all the designs are actually like really adorable and everything.

49
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,310
And...

50
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:17,050
I know the Cookie Run fandom is also very big and very fanatical too regarding...

51
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,450
Because it was so funny.

52
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,390
I was looking at...

53
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,990
Also, I turned down the music already.

54
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,830
So let me know if it's better.

55
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,670
But it was so funny because...

56
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,530
Cookie Run retweeted my tweet.

57
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,210
And then I was looking at the tweet replies.

58
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,730
And then people were just like...

59
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,070
Oh my god, does this mean...

60
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,530
Does this mean you're gonna add dragons into Cookie Run?

61
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,950
So I thought it was so cute.

62
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,330
They like have their own fandom and everything.

63
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,750
And like have like fan art and stuff like that.

64
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,710
It's like...

65
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,530
It's really cute.

66
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,810
I thought it was like really, really cute.

67
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,970
Alright, I'll turn down the music a little bit more again.

68
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,890
Let me know if it's a lot better.

69
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,110
But yes!

70
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,790
Apparently there is...

71
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,650
There is a new update.

72
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,590
In this game.

73
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,650
Called My Cookie.

74
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,510
And that is what we're gonna be checking out.

75
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,830
I will be using an account that Cookie Run has given me.

76
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,650
And...

77
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,350
You know what that means.

78
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,050
Free gacha pulls.

79
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,110
I love free stuff.

80
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,110
I haven't...

81
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,790
I haven't...

82
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,690
Let's go gambling!

83
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,250
I haven't...

84
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,570
Done gacha in a long, long time.

85
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,330
So...

86
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,250
That should mean...

87
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,650
That should mean...

88
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,790
I have stockpiled my gacha luck into it.

89
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,230
To pull some sick ass...

90
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,270
Is ass a swear?

91
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,250
Okay, I don't know.

92
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,710
It's a body part.

93
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,530
So it shouldn't be.

94
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,290
But some sick ass...

95
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,810
Cookies.

96
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,770
Even though I have no idea if my cookies are rare or not.

97
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,790
But like...

98
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,450
That's the best part.

99
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,670
If it's a bad pull.

100
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,110
I'll still be happy.

101
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,790
So...

102
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,650
Oh wait, you're right.

103
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,670
A lot of body parts are considered a force.

104
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,750
I swear.

105
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,630
But...

106
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,810
There is a...

107
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,090
There is a lot of stuff in this new update.

108
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,630
I was told.

109
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,450
So there is apparently...

110
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,070
There's a town square now.

111
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,010
And then there's like the my cookie design feature.

112
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,270
Where you can basically customize your own cookie-sona.

113
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,450
So your own...

114
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,650
So it's like a fursona.

115
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,830
But what if you're a cookie?

116
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,210
So you could be like that gingerbread man.

117
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,130
In Shrek.

118
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,890
I think.

119
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,450
I don't know.

120
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,790
Wait!

121
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,910
Oh my god.

122
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,550
I mean it's literally a gingerbread man.

123
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,030
So it's...

124
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,450
You could be your own cookie-sona!

125
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,050
So...

126
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,890
You can make your own cookie-sona.

127
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,690
And...

128
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,090
In the my cookie.

129
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,390
So it's either called icing.

130
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,050
That can be earned from various things.

131
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,270
Like sugarcoat cookie salon.

132
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
The weaving shop.

133
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,530
Or certain events.

134
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,790
Or even shop packages.

135
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,870
I can buy so many cosmetics.

136
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,650
Oh my god.

137
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,570
I haven't checked yet how much money I have.

138
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,590
In the account they gave me.

139
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,110
So I'm gonna spend it all.

140
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,790
I need to make my cookie-sona.

141
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,770
Um...

142
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,750
And yes.

143
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,930
And also the new special cookie as you see here.

144
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,230
Look at this giant ass ferret cookie.

145
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,630
Apparently that is a half...

146
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,170
Half furry, half cookie.

147
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,290
Cause they are the cream ferret cookie.

148
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,570
Oh my god.

149
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,430
The amount of times I've said...

150
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,890
The amount of times I've said cookie.

151
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,210
The amount of times I've said cookie.

152
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,830
Biscuit.

153
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,590
Alright for all you people out there.

154
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,450
A cookie is like a biscuit.

155
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,490
So you can make your own biscuit-sonas.

156
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,810
I'm very diverse.

157
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,670
I'm very inclusive.

158
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,250
Um...

159
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,630
But yes.

160
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,570
I'm very excited.

161
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,370
There's also like a limited gacha banner called...

162
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,950
Summer Vacay Costumes.

163
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,230
As well as some limited time events.

164
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,650
So let's go check this out.

165
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,350
There was an intro.

166
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,710
I have not entered the game.

167
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,810
Because like when I entered.

168
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,930
There was an intro.

169
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,990
So like there was a cutscene.

170
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,770
So I was scared of like...

171
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,490
I was scared that if I click on...

172
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,050
If I went in fully.

173
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,690
I would miss the cutscene.

174
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,710
And I don't know if it's important.

175
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,630
I don't know if it's important to the cookie lore.

176
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,050
So let's get right into it.

177
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,130
But yes.

178
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,730
Huge shout out again to Cookie Run for sponsoring this stream.

179
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,410
I really really do appreciate it guys.

180
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,590
Um...

181
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,490
Alright let's go in.

182
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:45,850
Hello.

183
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,590
Connecting.

184
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,650
Also I brought music down already.

185
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,830
Sound guide.

186
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,290
Let me know if it's better now.

187
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:57,650
Hey.

188
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,110
I heard a lot of people spent a lot of money on this game.

189
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,950
Is that true?

190
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,890
Any Cookie Run enthusiasts?

191
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,070
Willing to tell me how much they spent?

192
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,390
And...

193
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,110
Even if you're not proud of it?

194
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,870
Uh...

195
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:13,910
Yes.

196
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,330
Oh my god.

197
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,630
Oh my god.

198
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,210
There's narration?

199
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,390
There's narration?

200
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,370
That's great.

201
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,330
I don't have to read.

202
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,650
Holy shit.

203
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,530
A thousand dollars?

204
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,670
Holy shoot.

205
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,310
A thousand...

206
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,810
The filter did not work for me when I saw that amount.

207
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,650
The filter did not work for me when I saw that amount.

208
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,290
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,570
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,870
I saw that amount and my filter stopped working.

211
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,930
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,190
A king needs entertainment.

213
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,190
Wait is that the king?

214
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,750
Is this the king of Cookie Run?

215
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,070
Custard Cookie the third.

216
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,830
Are all the kings custards?

217
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,610
Who let this child be the third?

218
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:11,870
The king!

219
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,610
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

220
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,350
Ha ha ha ha ha!

221
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,570
It's carrying something heavy!

222
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,330
Like a chest full of shit!

223
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,170
No that's a king!

224
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,870
Custard Cookie time is money!

225
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,070
Maybe...

226
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,760
Tell him to go away!

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,900
Where is she going?

228
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,290
She's really speedy when there's treasure involved.

229
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,930
She's really speedy when there's treasure involved.

230
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,490
Wait if he's not the king...

231
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:41,510
Wait if he's not the king...

232
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,070
Then who gave him the crown?

233
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,810
A blueberry!

234
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,950
You're not a cookie!

235
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,630
Who let this bird in here?

236
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,290
Ha ha ha ha ha!

237
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,010
This is a Cookie Run kingdom!

238
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,150
Who let this bird in here?

239
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,730
Who let this bird in here?

240
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,390
That's my treasure you're talking about!

241
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,710
What

242
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,870
is that?

243
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,810
That's ice cream.

244
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,490
This is a baby!

245
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,930
That's a baby?

246
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,870
Where did you bring this little cookie from?

247
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,730
That's a baby!

248
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,350
That's a baby?

249
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,530
Ha ha ha ha ha!

250
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,910
What is that?

251
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,970
Oh my god!

252
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,150
Oh!

253
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,930
A letter from BeardCraft!

254
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,110
Oh it's a cookie dough!

255
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,330
That means you baked the baby!

256
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:35,810
It's

257
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:39,690
a cookie!

258
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,530
That's so cute.

259
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,650
That's actually really smart.

260
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,550
Oh my god you put the baby...

261
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,150
Oh my...

262
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,250
Someone put that baby in the oven!

263
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,210
Someone put that baby in the oven!

264
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,050
Ha ha ha ha!

265
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,730
What if I microwave the baby?

266
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,930
Alright, CustardCookieThe3rd and friends of the Cookie Kingdom.

267
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,070
Oh my god!

268
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,310
We met this cute little buddy while on our adventure!

269
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,890
So cute!

270
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,590
Unfortunately, where we're headed is not safe for a doughy little...

271
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,350
Oh my god!

272
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,850
We met this cute little buddy while on our adventure!

273
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,850
They abandoned their baby!

274
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,510
That's messed up!

275
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,870
They just owned the baby.

276
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,430
They put it in the orphanage.

277
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,550
They just owned the baby.

278
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,490
They put it in the orphanage.

279
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,490
Oh my god!

280
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,090
It's like in those shows where they leave the baby at the doorstep.

281
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,130
And be like, take care of it.

282
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,350
That's his baby?

283
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,070
Who did GingerBrave...

284
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,390
Who did GingerBrave...

285
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,450
put the baby in the oven for?

286
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,390
The baby!

287
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,710
Wait, so is he a pretend king?

288
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,210
Because he says, into my kingdom.

289
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,250
Who's the baker?

290
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:07,790
Yeah.

291
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,730
Who will this baby become?

292
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,810
Oh, he's like a pretend king.

293
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,710
I see.

294
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,010
Aww.

295
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,130
Let bro think he's a king.

296
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,030
Goo goo ga ga.

297
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,570
This is why you got disowned.

298
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,330
He's...

299
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
He's like, it's your problem now.

300
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,520
Someone freaking...

301
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm sorry, the baby got me.

302
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,780
Someone throw this baby into the oven.

303
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,060
So we can speed the process.

304
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,410
That can talk?

305
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,550
You're an animal.

306
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,510
Who are you?

307
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,510
Is that the fairy?

308
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,250
The baby's a fairy.

309
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,870
I don't care who you are.

310
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,270
Pass the baby.

311
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,210
Oh god.

312
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,810
Now sweet little cookie.

313
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,210
Please.

314
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,510
I need to skip the baby.

315
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,030
Following the blue bird to this very place to help you little one.

316
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,710
Look at my fluffy cream tail.

317
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,530
So soft and bouncy.

318
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,830
Are they gonna put the ferret and the cookie dough in the oven together?

319
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,430
Oh my god.

320
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,450
They're gonna get fur on the cookie dough.

321
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,750
You did it!

322
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,550
It's gonna eat you now.

323
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,770
Wait, it grew?

324
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,450
How it's still there?

325
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,590
Poof?

326
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,370
What?

327
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,410
What?

328
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,870
What?

329
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,710
What?

330
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,910
What?

331
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,670
What?

332
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,430
What?

333
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,770
Oh!

334
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,070
Everything I...

335
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,670
Everything I was taught about Cookie Run in the last ten minutes.

336
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,410
Gone.

337
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,250
They... they work.

338
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,010
Is it, like, a werewolf?

339
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,930
I'm a cream ferret.

340
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,370
That doesn't answer...

341
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,090
Are you a cookie?

342
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,530
The cream critters?

343
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,050
Mind you.

344
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,390
Eh,

345
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,720
cookie...

346
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
Oh, it is a Persona!

347
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,880
Oh!

348
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,460
He... the... okay, the ferret turned into... I thought... I thought they fused!

349
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,200
I thought... I legit... I thought... I legit... I thought they fused.

350
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,640
I was like, wait, what happened?

351
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,510
Oh, hey!

352
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,590
Okay, I get it.

353
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,970
This person can turn into an animal.

354
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,150
I get it.

355
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,670
Just because they're like a free babysitter.

356
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,220
You're not leaving the baby!

357
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,000
Wait, did we skip already?

358
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,900
Did we skip a couple... Oh my...

359
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,420
Where's the baby?

360
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,420
One strong cookie hug coming right up!

361
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,360
Where's the baby?

362
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,000
Where's the baby?

363
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,640
It says taller!

364
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,720
Clearly not tall enough!

365
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,180
I'm happy if you're happy.

366
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,060
God, thank you for the super chat!

367
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,160
Thank you, thank you!

368
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,780
You're gonna grow up bigger and stronger than yesterday!

369
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,960
Oh my...

370
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,020
At least I'm taller than the baby!

371
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,860
Yeah, because we can't even see the baby!

372
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,720
Right?

373
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,980
Tooth... Toothing-less baby dough.

374
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,140
Wait!

375
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,520
The cookies have teeth?

376
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,480
The cookie run in Kingdom Lore is so deep.

377
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,980
I didn't even realize they have teeth.

378
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,300
Where's the baby?

379
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,440
Where did the baby go?

380
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,040
Oh, Tooth-sing!

381
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Oh, it's like a tooth-sing with the icing!

382
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,020
It's icing tea!

383
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,400
Oh!

384
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,460
Oh!

385
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,540
I get you!

386
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,200
Tooth-sing?

387
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,740
I get it!

388
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,120
Does that mean there's a tooth fairy?

389
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,520
There's a tooth-sing?

390
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,260
Tooth-sing?

391
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,160
Oh my god.

392
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,740
There's a tooth-sing fairy?

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,160
Alright now, let's toss your tooth-sing up on the roof!

394
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,970
Wait, the blueberry bird is the tooth-sing fairy?

395
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,510
Oh no...

396
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,890
Oh no!

397
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,030
No, don't follow the false king!

398
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,410
He's a fake!

399
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,350
No!

400
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,430
The thing spoke!

401
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,110
Monster!

402
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,390
Burn the cookie!

403
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,410
It's only been a day!

404
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,450
Burn the cookie!

405
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,310
There's something wrong with that baby!

406
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,010
Where's the frickin'... Oh, that's me!

407
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,230
Don't burn the cookie!

408
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,950
Don't burn the cookie!

409
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,510
It's me!

410
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,350
Hey!

411
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,390
I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get... Don't burn the cookie!

412
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,950
I... No!

413
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,010
There's a baby on the log!

414
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,050
No!

415
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,450
I got disowned!

416
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,510
I'm an orphan!

417
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,770
I'm an orphan!

418
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,310
Turn off the oven!

419
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,470
Turn it off!

420
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,470
I'm an orphan!

421
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,530
What a plot!

422
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,490
Everything I said about the baby, I was just joking!

423
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,790
Hee-hee!

424
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,430
Ha-ha!

425
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,430
I don't really need a cook!

426
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,710
Do I get to dress up my cookie?

427
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:12,870
Whoa!

428
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,390
Welcome my cookie update!

429
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,170
The town square is back!

430
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,990
Complete in the quiz game!

431
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,970
Cream ferret cookie is here!

432
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,490
New season of Arab Busters in the Kaku Town Square!

433
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,470
New darkness artifact in Cookie Alliance!

434
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:34,870
Dressed for the...

435
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:35,330
Oh, this one!

436
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,110
This is a new gacha that they have!

437
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,730
Oh my god!

438
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,170
Wait, I can be a ferret too!

439
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,470
Okay, and then there's like this...

440
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,250
Oh, the cookie run tower!

441
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,450
Oh yeah, this is the newest event!

442
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,550
Alright...

443
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,610
Special!

444
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,230
Wait, can I...

445
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,690
Oh!

446
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,790
How much do I have?

447
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,650
Oh, I have...

448
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,530
Wait, I can...

449
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,410
What happens if I wake her up?

450
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,530
Oh!

451
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,950
I'll wake her up.

452
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,630
I have enough money.

453
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,210
Are you awake?

454
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,870
I have enough money.

455
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,430
Wake up.

456
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,590
Wake up!

457
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,090
Keep trying.

458
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,930
I won't stop!

459
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,410
Wake up!

460
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
What do you mean?

461
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,100
Wake up!

462
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,680
I thought you were my babysitter!

463
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,020
Are you serious?

464
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,800
You're supposed to be my babysitter!

465
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,200
What's shake up?

466
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,240
Oh, I shouldn't shake up.

467
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,460
I don't want to shake up.

468
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,240
I don't think I have enough.

469
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,200
It's not fair!

470
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,800
You're supposed to babysit me!

471
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,280
Oh, just because I grew up, you're going to stop babysitting me?

472
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,700
Just because I'm not a baby anymore!

473
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,540
That's so messed up.

474
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,940
Wait, can I attempt on the snapdragon cookie?

475
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,280
No, I can't!

476
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,520
I did it, Nerdy!

477
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,140
This is not fair!

478
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,680
Also, I need to fix the volume, so give me a sec.

479
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,340
Let me...

480
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,620
Just because I'm not a baby anymore, they think they can just leave?

481
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,200
Okay, I turned down the music again.

482
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,340
I'll still turn down the effects too.

483
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,860
It's so messed up.

484
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,720
I can't believe it.

485
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,000
I can't believe it would do such a thing.

486
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,460
How many crystals do I have?

487
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,160
Yes, by the way, like I said, huge shout out to...

488
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,920
I didn't know...

489
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,480
Huge shout out to the Cookie Run for giving me an account because I never played Cookie Run before.

490
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,140
Oh my god, there's so many things to do.

491
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,960
My name is Yeast Powder.

492
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,180
Oh my god, there's so many things.

493
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,180
Oh yeah, there's a town square!

494
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,880
Wait, are those all the other cookies?

495
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,980
Oh, is this my house?

496
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,120
Is that a cookie?

497
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,580
Oh, these are my cookies!

498
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh my god!

499
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
This is my town!

500
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,720
Oh my god!

501
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,480
This is my town!

502
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,160
Oh my god!

503
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,720
That's a lot!

504
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,400
Yeah.

505
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,020
Wait, not daffy, sorry!

506
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,220
Daisy?

507
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,820
There's a daisy?

508
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,100
There's a daisy cookie?

509
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
Wait, is there...

510
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,440
Oh, is this like...

511
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,680
I got special!

512
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:45,960
Oh!

513
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,300
Oh my god!

514
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,520
Oh my god!

515
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:49,720
Oh my god!

516
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm rich!

517
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,660
Oh my...

518
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,900
I don't even pick up money!

519
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,740
How many cookies do I have?

520
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,800
Oh, there's Default Dan!

521
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,020
There's Gingerbread Man!

522
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,380
There's Default Dan!

523
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
Oh my god, there's babies!

524
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,480
Who put these gnomes in my...

525
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,760
Oh wait, no, they're just decorations.

526
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,040
Sorry, that's just decoration.

527
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,100
Oh my god, I'm gonna spend all the money!

528
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,180
Sorry!

529
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:15,680
Sorry!

530
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:15,960
Sorry!

531
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,540
This is not even what I'm supposed to show you guys.

532
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,800
Sorry, I got...

533
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:26,280
I got really curious about the decorations and everything.

534
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,080
Wait, oh my god, there's...

535
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,240
Wait, you're not a cookie?

536
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,640
You're just goofy!

537
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,400
You're literally...

538
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,220
You're literally just...

539
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,260
What are you doing here?

540
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,800
You're not even a cookie...

541
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,080
You're not even cookie shaped.

542
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,480
You're not...

543
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,940
Who let these Disney characters...

544
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,620
into my cookie game?

545
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,020
Gosh.

546
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,200
Gosh.

547
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,080
Gosh Sora.

548
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,320
It seems that...

549
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,880
the Keyblade took us to Cookie Run.

550
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,480
You're not...

551
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,400
You're not edible!

552
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,460
Alright, we gotta...

553
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,400
go to Town Square.

554
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,140
Because that is like apparently the...

555
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,980
newest features that they did.

556
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,670
If I could see it.

557
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,600
Wait, you look rather frazzled.

558
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,300
It's okay.

559
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,460
It's okay, some...

560
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,100
It's okay, just a little...

561

608
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,580

I don't wanna be a waiter.

754
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:39,810
I was like, why am I a waiter?

755
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,590
Wait, how...

756
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,550
Which outfit is this?

757
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,470
Oh, it's this outfit.

758
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,250
I'm not gonna be a waiter.

759
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,490
I'm gonna... I'm not gonna be...

760
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,750
I'm not gonna be a goddamn waiter.

761
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,370
I'm a cool kid.

762
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,690
I'm gonna be so cool.

763
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,890
No, I could be preppy!

764
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,570
With the money...

765
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,010
I'm gonna be preppy!

766
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,890
Alright, let's see.

767
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,510
Yeah...

768
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,730
My dad can buy your house.

769
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,410
My dad is your dad.

770
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,090
Boss!

771
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,690
Okay, let me change the hat to match it too.

772
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,870
Okay, we gotta remove the hat.

773
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,470
Remove.

774
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,290
There we go.

775
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,450
Wait, unless...

776
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,650
A blueberry cap.

777
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:29,950
Yeah.

778
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,250
Unless I get more...

779
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,990
Yeah, I'm the private school cookie.

780
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,910
So punchable.

781
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,450
My dad works in Cookie Run!

782
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,130
That's me.

783
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,490
Why is it polite cookie?

784
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,630
That is definitely not what I was going for.

785
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,570
Oh, okay.

786
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,110
Wait, wait, wait.

787
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,830
I could change the name.

788
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:50,610
Okay.

789
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,990
16 bites.

790
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,770
Okay.

791
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,250
Ivy League.

792
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,370
I'm trying to...

793
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,630
I wanna know like what kind of cookie...

794
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,830
Polite and...

795
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,350
In parentheses.

796
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,630
Trust...

797
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,010
No!

798
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,310
I can't use trust!

799
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,010
No, they're right.

800
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,110
They're right.

801
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,790
They're right though.

802
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,570
Okay.

803
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,870
Okay.

804
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:44,970
Okay.

805
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:48,710
Okay.

806
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,390
All right.

807
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,790
I'm nipple baby cookie.

808
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,970
Okay.

809
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,430

810
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,310
This is...

811
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,530
This is my cookie.

812
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,870
I would do private school cookie if I had enough characters.

813
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:13,110
I have the money.

814
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,950
I have so much private school cookies.

815
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:26,170
Alright guys, do I get Nepo baby cookie or private school cookie?

816
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,730

817
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,750

818
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,950
Okay, Nepo.

819
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,990
Alright, we gotta get more cosmetics though.

820
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,690
We gotta get... what is this?

821
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,590
Is this a gacha?

822
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,230
Oh, these are for the outfits!

823
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,010
Right?

824
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,910
Oh, it's the limited time!

825
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,770
Okay, draw five.

826
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,350

00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,990
Oh my god, guys.

830
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,050
I wonder if I have enough, guys.

831
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,170
Okay.

832
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,570
Let's go.

833
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,010

834
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,030

835
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,150

840
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,910
A-S-S-N-E-P-O baby cookie!

841
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,730

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,600
Focktail!

844
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,300
You can't afford it.

845
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,360
You can't afford it.

846
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,320
Is that legendary?

847
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,340
Did I get the legendary?

848
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,860
Oh, I got another pink!

849
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,200
I hope this sounds a lot better now.

850
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,520
Alright, draw.

851
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,400
Draw my cookie.

852
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,150
What did I get?

853
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,410
I got a ribbon, I got shorts...

854
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,490
I don't need sunglasses.

855
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,490
Mysterious Milky Way hair dye.

856
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:06,750
Oh!

857
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,790
I can like change the hair color!

858
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,670
Do I have everything?

859
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,470
No, I'm missing like three...

860
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,910
Three, four, five.

861
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,310
It's okay, I can keep going.

862
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,050
Alright, am I gonna get it?

863
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,030
Oh, no.

864
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,530
Oh!

865
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,590
I like that hairstyle.

866
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,190
I'm still missing!

867
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,170
It's okay, we can keep going.

868
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,930
Ripped bottoms...

869
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,690
My dad would not like that.

870
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,590
Ripped bottoms does not go with the dress code.

871
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,010
I should be gacha-ing for the characters.

872
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,790
Like, I think I'm making regular Cookie Run players really sad.

873
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,670
Because I'm doing gacha on my cookie instead of like...

874
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,410
You know...

875
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,870
I'm doing gacha on my cookie instead of on the characters.

876
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,570
Here it is.

877
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,850
RIP bottoms.

878
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,210
RIP bottoms does not follow the dress code in my private school.

879
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,310
Oh, it's a separate currency?

880
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,070
Okay.

881
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,410
That's good.

882
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,050
Oh, that's great.

883
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,530
Okay.

884
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,750
A little cookie run.

885
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,910
Alright, let's see.

886
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,730
What do I have here?

887
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,190
Oh, is that another rare?

888
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,410
Draw the cookie!

889
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,290
What did I get?

890
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:40,950
Oh!

891
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,580
Sound of the sea?

892
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,480
Oh, it's for like when I'm holding it.

893
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,320
Oh, I got this.

894
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,740
Okay, I was gonna say.

895
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,740
Oh my god!

896
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,280
Oh my god!

897
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,640
My dad's gonna love it when I wear these two outfits.

898
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,780
I don't know.

899
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,360
I think I got like... what's regular?

900
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,560
Oh, so like you can just choose the outfit you want.

901
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,420
Oh, I can just straight up buy stuff.

902
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,200
Oh!

903
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,680
Check out our catalog.

904
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,680
Alright, I wanna see what I can get in the regular.

905
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,320
What does the magic conch say?

906
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,160
Oh, I got another rare!

907
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,320
Let's see.

908
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,680
What did I get?

909
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,880
Oh, I got a book!

910
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,500
That's when you know I'm smart.

911
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,260
I got a...

912
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,740
Is there stain on my white tank top?

913
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,520
My...

914
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,740
My stain on my...

915
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,100
My tank top.

916
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,540
Okay, closet time.

917
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,380
Alright, let's see.

918
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,460
Wait, you can read?

919
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,660
Okay, now I'm gonna definitely put on the book.

920
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,560
This does match it more though.

921
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,680
Yes, I can read.

922
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,460
I go to private school.

923
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,500
Oh, this is almost free.

924
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:26,700
I see.

925
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,400
Oh my god.

926
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,100
Oh, you can even read the word stuff.

927
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,180
This is so interesting!

928
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,220
It's so typical fanboying, actually.

929
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,760
This is crazy.

930
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,000
And...

931
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,720
Save in the library?

932
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,820
Oh, it's a protection lock so I don't accidentally...

933
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,420
Oh!

934
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,560
I see!

935
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,980
Yeah, you know what?

936
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,280
That's very smart because I would definitely do that.

937
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,100
I would definitely do that.

938
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,380
That's very smart.

939
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,840
Wait, do I get a bow?

940
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,800
Oh, it's like a tail thing.

941
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,500
What's this?

942
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,600
Oh no, I don't like that.

943
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,540
I want like...

944
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,340
I want like a...

945
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,580
Nice...

946
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,900
Preppy shoes.

947
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,200
I need like some preppy shoes.

948
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,800
No, those are sneakers.

949
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,800
Dad won't like that.

950
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,940
Dad won't like that.

951
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,480
Oh, everything is mine to equip.

952
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,140
Oh, okay.

953
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,600
I want to make sure like...

954
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
What's the difference between...

955
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,700
Oh, this is yellow stitch.

956
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,640
Wait, what's the difference between these two pants?

957
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,580
They look quite similar.

958
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,180
What about shirts?

959
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,220
Do I have any new shirts?

960
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,420
No, okay.

961
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,080
Oh, the white tank top.

962
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,860
What is this?

963
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,720
Am I wearing a freaking paper...

964
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,440
Toilet paper?

965
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,820
Oh, there's doubles.

966
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,700
Oh, you can get doubles?

967
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,240
I'm lucky then.

968
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,100
I'm very lucky.

969
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,260
All right.

970
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,760
What's the gotcha?

971
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,240
Oh.

972
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,700
Oh.

973
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,220
Oh.

974
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,900
What currency do I have?

975
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,960
I think I need more.

976
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,020
I think...

977
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:23,360
Oh, no.

978
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,360
I have to be very careful.

979
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,180
All right.

980
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,620
So, apparently...

981
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,880
Oh, wait.

982
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,480
What is the difference between...

983
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,000
Vaky Cookie Gotcha...

984
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,740
and Gotcha Fate?

985
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,700
Vaky Cookie Gotcha.

986
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,680
What is the difference between cookies and limited?

987
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,990
One is limited.

988
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,290
Vaky Cookie Gotcha.

989
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,910
Limited versus standard.

990
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,110
Thanks, guys.

991
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,490
One is limited.

992
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,250
Vaky Cookie Gotcha.

993
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,330
Vaky Cookie Gotcha.

994
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,990
Oh, but they're so...

995
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,090
Oh, these are costumes.

996
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,850
You can dress up your cookies.

997
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,210
I get it.

998
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,290
I don't know if I have those cookies.

999
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,330
We're gone, Tier?

1000
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,230
Hey, Cookie Run.

1001
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:28,350
It would be funny if like, you know, I hide my screen for a little bit and suddenly I have like a hundred thousand cookie cutters.

1002
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:31,630
That would be so silly though, wouldn't it, Cookie Run?

1003
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,370
So silly.

1004
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,270
Anyway, guys, I might need to hide my screen in five minutes.

1005
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,970
Wait, did I get two autumn leaves?

1006
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:47,610
Okay.

1007
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:50,290
Wait, I didn't get any of the new costumes!

1008
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,270
This is not summer vacation!

1009
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,770
He's wearing a tuxedo!

1010
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,050
I was on summer vacation!

1011
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:06,890
Alright, let's see.

1012
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:09,530
What did I get?

1013
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,550
Did I get any rares?

1014
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,340
Wait, they have a gnome wizard cookie?!

1015
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,340
Wait, they have... Okay, that's...

1016
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,900
They have the gnome wizard cookie!

1017
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,400
Please!

1018
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,800
Please don't give me... I haven't done gacha in so long!

1019
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,860
Why am I not getting summer vacation?!

1020
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,520
Why not?

1021
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,580
I got gnomed.

1022
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,740
I can't believe it.

1023
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:47,700
Alright.

1024
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,060
Oh!

1025
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,690
I got two!

1026
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,230
Oh my god.

1027
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,740
Conductor's summer...

1028
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,320
Wow, Desert's so cool!

1029
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,000
She's so cute!

1030
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,760
We already have her?!

1031
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:20,920
Okay.

1032
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,940
It's a thought that counts, guys.

1033
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:25,520
It's a thought.

1034
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,460
I didn't know I already have her!

1035
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,180
Who's this?

1036
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,860
Blast the heat wave away...

1037
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:45,880
Oh!

1038
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,200
I really love her hair.

1039
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,180
Her hair color.

1040
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,760
It's so pretty.

1041
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,840
I love like it's so aesthetically pleasing to look at.

1042
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,680
Oh my god.

1043
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,700
What the heck is...

1044
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,340
What the...

1045
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,700
Okay, I also like this guy too.

1046
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,660
This guy goes to the gym.

1047
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,460
This guy...

1048
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,860
This guy is definitely getting some gains.

1049
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,220
Someone put some...

1050
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,120
Someone put some bacon in that cookie.

1051
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,080
Do I have all of them?

1052
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,720
Technically?

1053
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,800
I wonder like...

1054
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,900
How can I tell if I...

1055
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:20,920
Uh...

1056
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,160
Have all of them?

1057
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,700
I really...

1058
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,900
I actually really like these two the most.

1059
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,400
So I'm glad I got them.

1060
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,440
Like, I'm sorry you...

1061
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:30,900
Oh my god.

1062
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,720
This guy definitely goes to private school.

1063
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,460
Oh...

1064
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,100
This...

1065
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,480
This guy definitely goes to private...

1066
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,560
Probability?

1067
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,220
I have...

1068
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,720
Oh, I'm literally only missing him!

1069
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,720
I'm missing private school kid!

1070
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,160
1% Ken Brulee.

1071
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,220
What am I missing?

1072
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,680
Okay.

1073
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,680
I am missing...

1074
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
I'm actually missing...

1075
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,800
Okay, I guess we have to.

1076
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,500
I wonder if I can take his clothes...

1077
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,740
And like...

1078
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,980
Put it on my cookie.

1079
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:13,980
Oh!

1080
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,400
It's so cute!

1081
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,240
I love the hoodie.

1082
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,800
Wait, is this another gnome?

1083
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,600
This is like...

1084
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,740
I don't want to get that go to school gnome.

1085
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,440
I want to steal his fit.

1086
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,300
Give me private school!

1087
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
I want private school guy!

1088
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,500
I want Ken Brulee!

1089
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,440
Oh, I got another gnome.

1090
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,260
Come on!

1091
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:41,900
Oh!

1092
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,920
Who are you?

1093
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,320
What the heck are you?

1094
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,380
You're not my summer vacation.

1095
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,100
You're a pomegranate cookie.

1096
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,200
Who puts pomegranate in their cookie?

1097
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,640
Freak.

1098
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,520
Guys, I'm sorry.

1099
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,500
I know there's like game content.

1100
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,680
But like...

1101
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,560
I need Ken Brulee.

1102
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,100
Ken?

1103
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,600
Ken, is that you?

1104
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,260
Okay, wait.

1105
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,940
Cookie.

1106
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,180
Okay, you're cute.

1107
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,520
Okay, I know you're cute.

1108
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,240
But I got to complete the set.

1109
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,280
I got to complete the set.

1110
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,800
Oh my god.

1111
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,860
Two elasties.

1112
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,440
Oh, she's cute.

1113
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,980
The royal knight's cute.

1114
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,720
Oh, she's cute too!

1115
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:41,700
Please.

1116
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,660
Where's Ken?

1117
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,280
Where are you?

1118
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,300
How much money do I have left?

1119
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,340
How much?

1120
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,640
Wait.

1121
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,040
Oh no, now I get all whites.

1122
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,140
Oh no.

1123
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,320
How much?

1124
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,080
Oh, that's fine.

1125
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:57,640
I don't have to worry.

1126
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,700
I can do this for as long as I want.

1127
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,040
I can do this.

1128
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,420
I can do this.

1129
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,200
For as long as I want.

1130
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,160
Please!

1131
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,720
I just need one more!

1132
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,720
Oh!

1133
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,980
What?

1134
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,400
What are you?

1135
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,040
Is that even a cookie anymore?

1136
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,340
Is that...

1137
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,460
Is that...

1138
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,920
Is that even a cookie?

1139
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:27,960
Is that...

1140
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,480
Is that even...

1141
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,700
Is that...

1142
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,860
That's like...

1143
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,400
Oh, you know what?

1144
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,100
I found out.

1145
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,520
I found out centaurs have like two chests.

1146
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,760
Because they have a chest right here.

1147
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,600
And then they have a chest right here too.

1148
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,940
So like...

1149
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,160
It's weird.

1150
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,600
It like messed me up a little bit.

1151
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:51,810
Come on.

1152
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,130
Summer?

1153
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:53,670
Summer?

1154
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,210
Yeah, two rib cages.

1155
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,390
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1156
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,270
Sorry, I'm not a biologist.

1157
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,570
Ken?

1158
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,070
Yeah!

1159
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,590
I did it!

1160
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,750
It only took like a thousand dollars.

1161
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:12,930
If I actually...

1162
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,090
It's okay.

1163
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,450
It only took like maybe $500.

1164
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:22,890
With the polls.

1165
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,270
But that's okay.

1166
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,570
Now I have the cookie that perfectly represents me.

1167
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,850
Alright, so guys, let me like hide my...

1168
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,210
No, I'm joking.

1169
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,370
I won't hide my screen.

1170
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,530
Wait, what's the difference between...

1171
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,730
Wait, do I have all of them?

1172
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,810
We aren't that... Oh yeah, you're right.

1173
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:48,010
Sorry.

1174
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,310
It only took $10, guys.

1175
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,130
$10... I don't know how many pulls I did.

1176
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,830
I don't know how...

1177
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,650
I've lost count!

1178
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:03,510
I lost count how many pulls I did.

1179
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,450
Oh, did I found all of them?

1180
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:05,990
No, I didn't.

1181
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,850
There's like stuff I haven't found there.

1182
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,070
There's epic.

1183
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,030
There's ancient.

1184
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,570
It's like $0.30 worth of pulls I did.

1185
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,330
Guys, that was like $0.30 by the way.

1186
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:24,810

00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,350
Oh, I have all the god cookies!

1194
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,690
I just can't read.

1195
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,550

I don't have a lot of that.

1202
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,670
That means I'm gonna spend it.

1203
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,030
I don't have a lot, so I'm gonna spend...

1204
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:02,310

It's a rainbow!

1215
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,180
Who are you?

1216
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,320

Every time I do gacha, I get a... I thought these... It's just normal.

1225
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,740
I thought that was just normal, guys.

1226
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,600

After you watch this stream and do gacha, you'll get my luck.

00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,390
Oh, is she?

00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:58,970

00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,770
Anyway, it's time for more gacha.

1259
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:22,810
My cookie needs more clothes.

1261
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,550

There's other stuff I have to do.

1264
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:34,670
But I need to make sure my cookie is like dressed appropriately.

1265
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,930

1266
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,650

1273
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,710
Why can you make your cookie a ball thing?

1274
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,390
This is important, guys.

1275
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,130
Oh, I got curly hair.

1276
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,690

Nope.

1283
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,290

My dad like bought me so many cookies.

1289
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,210
I don't know which one is the special one anymore.

1290
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,290
Because they're all like normal to me.

1291
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,030
Like...

1292
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,950
Oh my god, wait.

1294
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:31,710
Okay.

1295
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:34,330
What golden dookie on the sticky?

1296
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:37,230
Don't hurt me like this.

1297
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:40,170

1298
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,710

1303
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,810
Oh no, that's not.

1304
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,830
Oh, there it is!

1305
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,250
That has to be...

1306
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:51,370
Why am I...

1307
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,330
Okay, I have one of them.

1308
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:53,070

1309
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:53,350
Okay.

1386
01:01:59,470 --> 01:01:59,870

01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:29,190
Jelly worm?

1503
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:30,550
Are you the...

1504
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,710
You're the jelly lizard!

1505
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,570
Are you a worm?

1506
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,010
Something's wrong.

1507
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,470
I don't know how many times I was pondered over.

1508
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:40,510
Oh, silly me.

1509
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,110
Oh no, that's not the jelly worm.

1510
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,230
That's the jelly lizard.

1511
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,930
Where are the jelly worms?

1512
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,590
Oh no, she can't read.

1513
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,850
Guys, I need to find the jelly worm.

1514
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,930
Oh, it's on the right side!

1515
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,150
Thank you, I don't have eyes.

1516
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:02,990
I can't see it with all...

1517
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:05,010
with all the money in front of me.

1518
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,370
Are you the jelly worm?

1519
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:11,990
Is that...

1520
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,670
I can't...

1521
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:14,250
Are you...

1522
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,370
You're the granola cookie.

1523
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,210
Oh, it's Smiley Jelly Worm!

1524
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,670
It's because everybody was there!

1525
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,550
I found...

1526
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:20,050
I found them.

1527
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:21,590
Oh my god, you're so tiny!

1528
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,150
Fulfill 10 wishes?

1529
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:28,810
Okay.

1530
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,510
I'm gonna do that.

1531
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:34,610
Fulfill 10 wishes from the tree.

1532
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,190
Okay, and then this is...

1533
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,090
Clay Mail Reward.

1534
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,290
Oh, I can do that!

1535
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,290
Where's the mailbox?

1536
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:43,990
Mail Reward.

1537
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:46,750
Oh my god.

1538
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,290
Where's my mail?

1539
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:50,770
Oh, there it is!

1540
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:51,190
Down here!

1541
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:51,970
I see it!

1542
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,670
Who left my mail on the floor?

1543
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:56,830
Smithers?

1544
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:59,610
I wonder what's inside the vault.

1545
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:01,650
Something 5.

1546
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,110
Is that my mail?

1547
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,370
It has to be my mail, right?

1548
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,890
Oh, there's a key here!

1549
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:11,950
Guys, what's the code?

1550
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,730
You only get 3...

1551
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,530
Guys, who did it?

1552
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:26,310
Guys, we know the third number is 3, guys.

1553
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,310
We know...

1554
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:30,430
We know the third number is...

1555
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:32,990
Is 5.

1556
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:33,350
5.

1557
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,310
Guys, we gotta work together!

1558
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,510
Guys, we gotta work together!

1559
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,750
Oh, nice!

1560
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:41,510
Okay, no!

1561
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,470
Thanks guys!

1562
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:44,710
Guys, we did it!

1563
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:45,190
Together!

1564
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,630
We did it!

1565
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:51,930
Together!

1566
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:54,310
Nice!

1567
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,350
Team work.

1568
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,090
I did it.

1569
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,010
Guys...

1570
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:06,270
Yippee!

1571
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,270
I did it.

1572
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,110
Oh, is it this?

1573
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:17,830
Alright, claim.

1574
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:20,590
I did my quest.

1575
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:23,030
I did, I claimed it.

1576
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,630
I claimed it.

1577
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,150
Quest complete.

1578
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,150
Oh, nice!

1579
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:30,810
All me.

1580
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,810
Oh, there's no request.

1581
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:36,330
Okay.

1582
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,070
Quest.

1583
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,090
And now...

1584
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,430
Claim mail reward.

1585
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,390
Oh, it's in the town square.

1586
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,650
What the heck is a mailbox?

1587
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:48,850
Oh, I have to claim all?

1588
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:52,150
Oh, nice.

1589
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:53,570
Okay.

1590
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:56,830
Make your choice.

1591
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,090
I want...

1592
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,770
Ungabunga string.

1593
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,230
I always wanna be strong.

1594
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:04,250
Alright, I did it.

1595
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,550
I did it, Mr. Silkworm!

1596
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:09,530
Or Smart Jellyworm.

1597
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:10,470
Sorry, Smart Jellyworm.

1598
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:13,810
Talk to me.

1599
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,590
That's so hard to see.

1600
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:17,570
Did I not...

1601
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:19,530
Did I not...

1602
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:20,690
Did I not get it?

1603
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,190
Did I not get it?

1604
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,390
Guys.

1605
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,230
Where's my mailbox?

1606
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,770
I'm not used to...

1607
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,150
Guys, I'm not used to having a mailbox, guys.

1608
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,990
Why mailbox when you can email me?

1609
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,890
Oh, top right quest book.

1610
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:42,510
Oh!

1611
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,130
Claim one reward.

1612
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,820
Press the quest?

1613
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,560
Oh!

1614
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,720
Oh, wait, no?

1615
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:56,920
No?

1616
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,400
No.

1617
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:58,900
No...

1618
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,140
Hahaha.

1619
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:02,220
Hahaha.

1620
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,040
Hahaha.

1621
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,500
Never mind.

1622
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:05,320
No.

1623
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:05,640
No.

1624
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:05,900
Oh.

1625
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:06,580
Hahaha.

1626
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:07,620
Hahaha.

1627
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,640
Wait.

1628
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,200
Guys, we're learning.

1629
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,440
Hahaha.

1630
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,140
Oh, they're the red puppies.

1631
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,540
Wait, I talked to them already.

1632
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,540
They're mailboxes?

1633
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,880
We use dogs for mail?

1634
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,900
I'm learning so much.

1635
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,440
Oh, my god!

1636
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:25,820
They are!

1637
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:25,920
We are!

1638
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,880
Look at these freaks.

1639
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,340
Look at these little silly guys.

1640
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,220
No!

1641
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:38,740
Ready!

1642
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,680
I have to wait an hour!

1643
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,200
We got to be shubbed.

1644
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:46,580
No!

1645
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,360
Look at these non-cookie freaks!

1646
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,840
You're not a cookie!

1647
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,740
We use you for mail because you're not a cookie!

1648
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,660
A genetically engineered join the post.

1649
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,360
Did we make them like that?

1650
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,060
Oh, we're the monster all alike!

1651
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,060
The cake houses are built different.

1652
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:17,980
Okay.

1653
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:25,660
Alright.

1654
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,880
I think we explored a lot from the kingdom.

1655
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,980
Oh, I claim leaving town.

1656
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,040
Yes, give me everything.

1657
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,260
Yes!

1658
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,520
I want it all!

1659
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,260
I'm never satisfied!

1660
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,260
Give it all to me!

1661
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,040
Alright.

1662
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,360
Let's see.

1663
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:44,040
Oh.

1664
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,520
There's apparently... Oh my god!

1665
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,320
Who are you?

1666
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,580
Who are you?

1667
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,820
You look like the...

1668
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,040
You look like the...

1669
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:55,660
You look like the...

1670
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,140
Like the...

1671
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,180
The anime boy that's about to...

1672
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,320
You know, in like anime.

1673
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,720
They're like, you know...

1674
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,520
They're like, I'm here to help you.

1675
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,660
Good, because I need all the help I can get.

1676
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:08,840
Oh my god!

1677
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:09,620
What are you?

1678
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:10,960
That's not a cookie!

1679
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,360
Wait, is that a BTS cookie?

1680
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,520
Oh my god!

1681
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,000
Oh my god!

1682
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,040
Oh my god!

1683
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,740
He is!

1684
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,760
Wait, who are you?

1685
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:27,940
Oh my god!

1686
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:28,480
It's Jin!

1687
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,060
It's... Oh my god!

1688
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,060
It's him!

1689
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,600
Wait, what's your story?

1690
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,320
Oh my god, it is him!

1691
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,900
No way!

1692
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,280
Wait, what's your story?

1693
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,180
What's your story?

1694
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,360
Meet everyone's darling, Jimin Cookie.

1695
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:52,440
Oh my god!

1696
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,040
Wait!

1697
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,700
What about Mickey?

1698
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,740
Or Goofy?

1699
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:57,420
What's his lore in Cookie Run?

1700
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,480
Where is he?

1701
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,060
Where's Goofy?

1702
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,240
I need to find Goofy!

1703
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,040
No, not you!

1704
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,180
I don't care about you!

1705
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,600
I care about Goofy!

1706
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,860
There's so many cookies in my kingdom!

1707
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,340
What's up, buddy?

1708
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:10,680
Stop!

1709
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:10,920
Stop!

1710
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,300
Guys, there's too many cookies in my kingdom!

1711
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,880
I'm trying to find... I'm trying to find...

1712
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,920
I'm trying to find Goofy!

1713
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,440
Where are you, Goofy?

1714
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:30,760
What?

1715
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,600
This is gonna be awesome!

1716
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,180
What's your lore?

1717
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,780
This is gonna be awesome!

1718
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,780
Tell us a very special, Fox.

1719
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,140
You're not even a cookie!

1720
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,680
Where's the cookie part?

1721
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:46,720
The tails!

1722
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,100
That's not a cookie!

1723
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,660
Of course, now the...

1724
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,620
Two are the best friends and the tail knows his way around.

1725
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,380
Oh!

1726
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,540
But with Sonic health, he has gained in...

1727
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:00,940
Oh!

1728
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,560
Let's promote you.

1729
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,300
I have...

1730
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,680
Oh, not enough soul stones?

1731
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,480
How many...

1732
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,360
Upgrade.

1733
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,070
Your skill can't exceed.

1734
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,330
Don't worry, I got you.

1735
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:30,970
Let's go.

1736
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,650
There we go, we did it.

1737
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:37,970
Now you're the...

1738
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:39,950
Now you're the strongest.

1739
01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:47,890
Now you're the strongest.

1740
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:48,210
Now you're the strongest.

1741
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,710
Cookie out there.

1742
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,010
Tails is met.

1743
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,310
You will be...

1744
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:55,190
You're not one star!

1745
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:56,650
You will be...

1746
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,410
Met.

1747
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:03,710
I'll make you the strongest cookie out there.

1748
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,270
Alright, nice.

1749
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,290
Now we have a strong tails.

1750
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,030
Now clean my kingdom.

1751
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:14,310
The strongest one star.

1752
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:15,610
Wait, can I actually?

1753
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:16,450
Okay.

1754
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:17,890
Oh, it's the quiz game!

1755
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,890
That's the newest thing!

1756
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:22,090
That's the newest event!

1757
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,640
So I'm heading over to...

1758
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,000
It's not a game time yet.

1759
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:29,740
Come back later.

1760
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,160
In 43 minutes...

1761
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:31,400
No!

1762
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,420
It's so close!

1763
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,080
No!

1764
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,380
I can't believe it.

1765
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,480
I was just too late.

1766
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,280
I was too busy.

1767
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,480
Guys, I was too busy.

1768
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,300
Leveling up tails!

1769
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,320
I was too busy leveling up tails.

1770
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:54,580
What's this?

1771
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,420
It's also a new event.

1772
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,560
This one.

1773
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,360
What's this?

1774
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,300
Combat preset or...

1775
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,060
Apparently, you use it to combat a preset order of any ways to battle.

1776
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,460
Earn points to receive rewards as well as try...

1777
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:08,900
Oh!

1778
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,260
I want to battle!

1779
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,560
Battle, please.

1780
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,080
Oh, it randomized!

1781
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,460
Oh, it's over.

1782
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,320
It's over for them.

1783
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,020
It's so over.

1784
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,360
I wish it brought tails though.

1785
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,700
Time to fight.

1786
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:34,640
It's okay.

1787
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:37,760
What did I do?

1788
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,420
It's over.

1789
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,680
Get them out of here.

1790
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,520
Oh my God!

1791
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,500
Oh wait, no, no, no.

1792
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,320
They're okay.

1793
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,560
I did it.

1794
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:48,780
Yay!

1795
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,280
Damage received minus.

1796
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:55,180
I did it!

1797
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,640
Select a cookie to swap?

1798
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:02,540
198!

1799
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:05,100
That's right.

1800
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:05,660
Get out of here.

1801
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:06,680
Where's my tails?

1802
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,100
I want my tails to come in!

1803
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,360
Okay, click everything.

1804
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,020
Click everything.

1805
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,740
Click everything.

1806
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,960
오!

1807
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:26,900
now replace?

1808
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,920
More damage equals more.

1809
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,400
More damage equals stronger.

1810
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,960
King's blessings!

1811
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,340
All right.

1812
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:41,360
Cool down, decreased equally to increase food.

1813
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,680
Oh, attack speed!

1814
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,440
Wait, no, this one.

1815
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,120
Wait, it's blue.

1816
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,060
Wait, that was yellow.

1817
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,920
Is yellow better than blue?

1818
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,460
Of course, I'm yellow.

1819
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,040
Wait, auto?

1820
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:53,820
Oh.

1821
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:59,800
123 more... oh, that's HP.

1822
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:02,480
More attack.

1823
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,700
More attack equals better cookie.

1824
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:11,100
Don't... I will replace every cookie.

1825
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:19,720
I will replace every cookie.

1826
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,040
Oh, that's a god cookie?

1827
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:23,940
Oh.

1828
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,880
Guys, why didn't you stop me?

1829
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,380
Guys, why didn't you stop me?

1830
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,480
You could have stopped me.

1831
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,320
You know I don't read!

1832
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,420
Attack.

1833
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:47,300
56,000.

1834
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,440
Yes.

1835
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:55,140
Boss?

1836
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,080
It's just a cake.

1837
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,360
Use everything.

1838
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,220
Go, my cookies!

1839
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:04,980
Go... is this speed?

1840
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,400
Oh, wait.

1841
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,880
That's a lot better.

1842
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,740
See?

1843
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:09,260
Look.

1844
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,460
It's so easy.

1845
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,460
When an ally summons...

1846
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:14,780
Oh!

1847
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:16,480
Yellow!

1848
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,500
Yellow is better.

1849
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,200
59,000?

1850
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:21,660
Is it?

1851
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,460
Where's Tiz?

1852
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,620
198... 26,000... 183...

1853
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,480
29,000!

1854
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,400
This guy.

1855
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,220
None of my characters have summons?

1856
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,380
Eventually, it'll happen!

1857
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,060
Bullseye!

1858
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:41,820
Bullseye!

1859
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:43,600
Bullseye!

1860
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,680
Bullseye!

1861
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,000
Bullseye!

1862
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,040
Bullseye!

1863
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,200
It'll happen eventually!

1864
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,320
Oh, my cookie's dead!

1865
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:48,180
No!

1866
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,620
Why did I choose this cookie?

1867
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,380
Guys, why didn't you stop me?

1868
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:58,980
Why...

1869
01:20:58,980 --> 01:20:59,700
Bullseye!

1870
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,460
Bullseye!

1871
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:01,300
For the win!

1872
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,300
Guys, you could have stopped me.

1873
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,000
Bullseye!

1874
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,720
Why are they so strong?

1875
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,320
Is it because they're metal?

1876
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:16,620
No!

1877
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,400
My other tank is gonna die!

1878
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,060
It has so many attacks!

1879
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,020
But bigger number!

1880
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,060
Are you trying to tell me bigger number doesn't mean anything?

1881
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,420
Oh no, guys, I don't think we're gonna...

1882
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:37,980
Guys, guys, he's not doing so well!

1883
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,080
Guys, are you trying to tell me...

1884
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:50,620
numbers and... strength... strength doesn't mean anything?

1885
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,200
Is that... oh no, King, please!

1886
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,600
They're so low, King!

1887
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,220
Please!

1888
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,160
Why don't you do anything?

1889
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,440
You're level 80!

1890
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,220
It's...

1891
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,100
so fair!

1892
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,540
Not without some way!

1893
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:14,340
Who got to 59,000?

1894
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,320
Is that my high score?

1895
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:22,440
Who got to 59,000?

1896
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,960
He doesn't need...

1897
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,600
Oh, all he does is heal.

1898
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,400
Oh, that makes more sense now.

1899
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:32,720
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense that all he does is heal.

1900
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:38,560
I'm still trying to find Goofy.

1901
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,840
Oh gosh.

1902
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,760
Oh, Donald!

1903
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:50,150
Give the white fluffy cookie a blueberry jelly bean...

1904
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:51,070
Oh my God!

1905
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,090
He has a little cream on his...

1906
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:54,410
I'm a Donald Stan.

1907
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,010
Oh my God!

1908
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:58,230
He's my BTS.

1909
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,490
Look at him!

1910
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,050
He has a little cream on the top of his head!

1911
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:09,210
Donald, why couldn't you be...

1912
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:14,150
Why weren't you there in my... in my battle?

1913
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:16,390
Okay, guys, I want to put Tails in.

1914
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:20,710
Let's see.

1915
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:23,070
I want to go to... where's my team?

1916
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:24,330
Cookies.

1917
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:30,430
As the master of the Ivory Pagoda...

1918
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:30,630
Whoa!

1919
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:32,790
What's your story?

1920
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:37,550
Apathy.

1921
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:38,290
Okay.

1922
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:39,670
That's your story.

1923
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:40,810
Wait, is there...

1924
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:41,910
Whoa!

1925
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,150
Oh, my Max love... Oh, wait.

1926
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,310
Where's the... I want to...

1927
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,210
Wait, I'm missing one cookie?

1928
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:52,510
Who am I missing?

1929
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:55,590
I'm actually missing one cookie!

1930
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:58,030
Whoa!

1931
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,530
How could I be missing one cookie?

1932
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:01,510
Hahaha!

1933
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,610
I want to change my Lotto.

1934
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:08,270
I want to change my cookie Lotto.

1935
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:10,410
Okay, let's see.

1936
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:13,210
Uh...

1937
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:15,670
Build Kingdom Affairs.

1938
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,230
Dashboard Shop.

1939
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,030
Promoting...

1940
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,750
It's Butter Roll Cookie?

1941
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,050
What does Butter Roll Cookie look like?

1942
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:32,150
I'm not Max.

1943
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:32,990
Gotcha!

1944
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:35,850
Where are you, Butter Roll Cookie?

1945
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,110
Where are you?

1946
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:53,050
Found, found, found, found, found, found, found, found, found, found, found, found.

1947
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,780
I can scroll to the bottom of the list?

1948
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,360
Wait... Oh!

1949
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,860
The bottom of the list tells me...

1950
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,400
Sorry, there's so many cookies.

1951
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,280
It's CREAM FERRET!

1952
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,730
My fingers...

1953
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,190
My fingers...

1954
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,530
It's Cream Ferret.

1955
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:27,690
Hahaha!

1956
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,750
Stupid Ferret.

1957
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:31,970
Wake up!

1958
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,170
Wake up!

1959
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,590
Wait, where...

1960
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:36,130
Where's the...

1961
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:37,530
I'm trying to...

1962
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:38,110
Events.

1963
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,050
Okay.

1964
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:41,590
There you go.

1965
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:44,150
Wake up!

1966
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:45,410
Hahaha!

1967
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,670
Wake up!

1968
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,710
Wake up!

1969
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,250
You're my only cookie!

1970
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:59,790
When did I get Butter on my pad?

1971
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:01,570
Wake up!

1972
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:03,910
How do I get this?

1973
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:08,350
You need to complete my collection!

1974
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:13,310
I don't have it!

1975
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:14,770
It's I need a hundred!

1976
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:16,510
Wake up!

1977
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:19,630
You're supposed to babysit me!

1978
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,390
You're literally the babysit Ferret!

1979
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,390
I used it all up.

1980
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,270
I used up...

1981
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:31,050
Oh, you're pretending.

1982
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:33,950
You're pretending to be sleeping, aren't you?

1983
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:35,250
I can tell you're pretending.

1984
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:36,750
I know you're pretending.

1985
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:37,250
Hahaha!

1986
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:39,730
Hahaha!

1987
01:26:41,410 --> 01:26:43,390
I didn't have enough!

1988
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,450
I didn't have enough, guys!

1989
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,910
Alright, let's see.

1990
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:49,790
My cookie.

1991
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,990
Okay, I want to change up my party.

1992
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:54,510
Is it... Bonds?

1993
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:56,490
Best birthday...

1994
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:56,590
Oh!

1995
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:59,130
I have all the Bond buffs too.

1996
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,250
That's crazy.

1997
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,370
I need to find Tails.

1998
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,490
I want to know...

1999
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:05,250
Oh my God!

2000
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,430
All these designs are so pretty though.

2001
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,110
My God!

2002
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,530
There's a pumpkin cookie!

2003
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:12,250
That's not a cookie!

2004
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:13,610
Hahaha!

2005
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:16,610
That is not a cookie!

2006
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:17,250
Hahaha!

2007
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:19,950
Where's...

2008
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:20,930
Oh, there's Tails!

2009
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:22,490
Oh, these are like the crossovers!

2010
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,090
There's Sonic!

2011
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:26,550
Level 31 Sonic!

2012
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:28,490
There's all the promotions!

2013
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:31,710
That's so cute!

2014
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,990
Where's like the...

2015
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:36,070
Where's Goofy?

2016
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:38,770
Wait, where's Goofy?

2017
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:41,110
Rarity...

2018
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,080
Oh!

2019
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,180
Okay, wait.

2020
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,100
By rarity.

2021
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,080
Who's the rarest?

2022
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,520
Right here.

2023
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,720
I can't believe I didn't get...

2024
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,080
I can't believe it!

2025
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,720
I can't believe I didn't...

2026
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,400
I couldn't wake her up.

2027
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,720
I'm so sad.

2028
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,020
It's okay, I have Tails.

2029
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,460
The strongest Tails out there.

2030
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:06,380
You know what?

2031
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,760
Tails is so strong...

2032
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:08,860
That...

2033
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,580
Uh...

2034
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,920
Oh, it's like a...

2035
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:11,740
Cosmetic.

2036
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,420
Tails is so strong...

2037
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:15,620
That like...

2038
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:17,280
He can solo everything.

2039
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,760
Oh no, I have no more star jellies.

2040
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:21,960
I used up all of it.

2041
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:22,660
I...

2042
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,080
Hahaha!

2043
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,140
Because...

2044
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,620
Because I didn't read...

2045
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:29,340
I never read...

2046
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,060
Okay, I wanna...

2047
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,420
Kingdom Arena.

2048
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,560
What's this?

2049
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,580
Oh!

2050
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,460
Season 1?

2051
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,940
Arena seasons?

2052
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,880
Okay, I'm gonna...

2053
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,080
Redo my team.

2054
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,820
I wanna redo my team.

2055
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:49,040
Uh...

2056
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,100
Attackers.

2057
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,340
Alright.

2058
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,580
Where are you...

2059
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,620
Where are you, Tails?

2060
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,780
You're going in there.

2061
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:58,320
Just you though.

2062
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:03,270
Clear.

2063
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:05,230
I calculate a disaster!

2064
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:08,190
You got this, Tails.

2065
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,590
What's the worst that can happen?

2066
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:11,890
Oh, wait!

2067
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:15,290
You got this, Tails.

2068
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:15,870
What's...

2069
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:16,330
Hahaha!

2070
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:18,490
Hahaha!

2071
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:19,790
Hahaha!

2072
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:21,570
Hahaha!

2073
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:22,790
Hahaha!

2074
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:23,310
Hahaha!

2075
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:23,570
Hahaha!

2076
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:24,070
Hahaha!

2077
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:24,350
Hahaha!

2078
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:27,250
You can solo these guys!

2079
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:27,910
Hahaha!

2080
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:28,670
Hahaha!

2081
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,650
What's the worst that can happen?

2082
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:35,450
I don't know what you're talking about.

2083
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:36,070
What's the...

2084
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,070
Literally, what's the worst that can...

2085
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,810
I have like 10.

2086
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:39,370
You know that.

2087
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,770
What's the...

2088
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:40,930
There's level 2!

2089
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:44,910
Literally, what's the worst that can happen?

2090
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,130
Yes, I wish to continue.

2091
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:48,590
Hahaha!

2092
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:50,830
Hahaha!

2093
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:51,970
Hahaha!

2094
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,310
Hahaha!

2095
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:55,890
Oh, I can't move.

2096
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,170
He's about to...

2097
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:00,110
What are you gonna do, kill me?

2098
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:03,890
Oh, my God, you guys did not believe in Tails!

2099
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:05,790
Let's go!

2100
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:10,210
Oh, absolute PM.

2101
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,610
I'm just sending Tails.

2102
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:13,790
Am I finding real people?

2103
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:18,370
Tails, leave.

2104
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:20,470
Wait, are these real people?

2105
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,790
That's right!

2106
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:30,930
Oh, yeah, I'm teaching these children a lesson.

2107
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:37,370
That's right, children!

2108
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:42,070
All I need is one kick!

2109
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,030
Get out of here!

2110
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,510
Should've gotcha more children!

2111
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:53,790
Go gotcha more child!

2112
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:58,450
And you too can be just as good as Tails!

2113
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:01,570
Teach them the real mode!

2114
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,850
I don't need to add Sonic, I can just add Tails.

2115
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,550
Met Tails, Dayruid.

2116
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:10,510
Who are you?

2117
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:11,650
Level 5!

2118
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,130
Get out of here!

2119
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:19,130
Should've been the son of the creator of Cookie Run.

2120
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:20,450
My dad worked hard to make this game.

2121
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:21,390
He's the one who makes that Cookie Run.

2122
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,170
Get out of here!

2123
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,210
190 steps!

2124
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:27,050
That's cute!

2125
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:28,770
I did 19,000 damage.

2126
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:31,150
You only got 99%!

2127
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:34,650
I only got 1% of my HP.

2128
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:40,250
Nice.

2129
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,010
Yeah!

2130
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,070
Ring up!

2131
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:44,850
Ring up!

2132
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,050
Alright, nice.

2133
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:48,590
Alright, who else?

2134
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:50,390
Oh, you got... you have some...

2135
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:50,510
Oh!

2136
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:51,590
Okay.

2137
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:52,470
No, not you.

2138
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,230
Alright, anyway.

2139
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:02,190
Get in here and fight me!

2140
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,810
That's right, child!

2141
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:13,450
You were the first person I saw today!

2142
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:15,730
Get out!

2143
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:15,810
Get out!

2144
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:18,230
What's wrong with you?

2145
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:20,410
No, no, it's just a misclick, guys.

2146
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:21,510
It was a misclick.

2147
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,350
I don't know what to...

2148
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:25,630
I want my next fight!

2149
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:28,550
Oh my God!

2150
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:29,690
What are you doing here?

2151
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:31,230
Yeah, where are you?

2152
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,590
You two do not...

2153
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:35,030
You know damn well...

2154
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:37,390
A million of power...

2155
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:38,690
Oh, 107?

2156
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:40,550
Ha, ha, ha!

2157
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:42,510
Ha, ha!

2158
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:44,930
You have a hundred and...

2159
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:46,190
7000!

2160
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,610
Wait, actually...

2161
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,290
I don't know, this is a little risky.

2162
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:57,070
This is just a little risky.

2163
01:32:57,470 --> 01:33:01,530
I don't think Tails will make it.

2164
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:03,330
Okay, they haven't healed it.

2165
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:04,450
Okay, you're right.

2166
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:07,490
Maybe I'll just bully this guy.

2167
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:13,010
Get out!

2168
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:14,350
Taro!

2169
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:16,870
Get out!

2170
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:21,430
There you go!

2171
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:22,790
Easy!

2172
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,710
Another 1%!

2173
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,590
Nice!

2174
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:29,550
Oh my god!

2175
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:32,170
Easiest fight of my life!

2176
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:36,370
Oh!

2177
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:39,130
T-Frontz won!

2178
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:43,650
Where did these guys...

2179
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:44,190
You know what?

2180
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,110
I can...

2181
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:46,870
Oh, 13.

2182
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:50,050
Oh, you spent so much money on these two characters!

2183
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,210
Clearly not enough!

2184
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:57,390
Go back and spend more money!

2185
01:34:00,230 --> 01:34:02,850
Go back and spend more money!

2186
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:04,450
That's right!

2187
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:07,650
Oh, what happened to your healer?

2188
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:09,470
Oh, that's cute!

2189
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,570
Oh!

2190
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:12,070
Wait, I can't move!

2191
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:13,290
Wait a minute!

2192
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,610
That's cute!

2193
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,470
I'm gonna roll in it!

2194
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:17,510
I'm gonna go in 8 seconds!

2195
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:19,990
And destroy your healer!

2196
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,930
I don't need heals!

2197
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:23,690
In 1 second!

2198
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:27,750
Oh, what happened to your healer, little guy?

2199
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:29,030
Oh, what happened to your healer, little guy?

2200
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,390
That's right!

2201
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:30,430
Get out of my game!

2202
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:31,510
Get out!

2203
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:33,190
It has 80 bucks.

2204
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,410
It has 80 bucks.

2205
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:37,190
It's so over.

2206
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:39,190
Okay, I got rid of their support.

2207
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:40,590
That's all that matters.

2208
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:42,350
My ranking?

2209
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:43,170
Oh, wait...

2210
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:45,730
Who put these babies in here?

2211
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:47,890
What the hell is this?

2212
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:49,570
The hell is supremacy?

2213
01:34:53,790 --> 01:34:55,490
Who put these...

2214
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,730
There we go.

2215
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,230
We don't need Sonic!

2216
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:02,210
All we need is our really strong tails!

2217
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,830
That is overkill on that support.

2218
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,490
How did you get in my elo?

2219
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:11,610
The Doki train does not stop!

2220
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:13,730
Rink up!

2221
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:16,230
Silver 3!

2222
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:20,350
Oh, the default Dan?

2223
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:23,450
Oh, you have default Dan?

2224
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,330
Should have gotcha'd more!

2225
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,770
You should have gotcha'd more!

2226
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:34,490
Get out, default Dan!

2227
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,610
Alright, nice.

2228
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:38,710
I'm not smurfing!

2229
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:40,290
This is literally my first time playing.

2230
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,110
Alright.

2231
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:46,890
I'm not smurfing!

2232
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,390
This is my first time playing this game!

2233
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:52,370
I'm just that good!

2234
01:35:54,330 --> 01:35:57,030
I'm literally just... I'm that guy!

2235
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:59,490
Oh, you have a tiger?

2236
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:01,770
That's right, you had a tiger!

2237
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:08,150
Why that 200k?

2238
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,610
What 200k team?

2239
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:10,850
I don't know what you're talking about.

2240
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:11,590
I'm just that good.

2241
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:12,910
I'm already at silver 2.

2242
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:15,130
I don't know what you're talking...

2243
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:16,690
What the heck!

2244
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,370
2 million!

2245
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:22,070
Bro, they have the whole god army!

2246
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:24,110
Who put this guy in here?

2247
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:26,510
2... 2 million!

2248
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:28,090
This is silver 2!

2249
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,270
What are you doing here?

2250
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:32,430
It's silver 2!

2251
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:35,190
Oh my god, this is like a whole baby!

2252
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:36,890
Look at how tiny they are!

2253
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:39,810
Alright, this is my last battle card.

2254
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:41,050
And then I get kicked out.

2255
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:44,910
Fight that whip!

2256
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:46,750
He's here for you!

2257
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:49,630
There we go.

2258
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:52,710
Back to the babies.

2259
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:54,450
Yay!

2260
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:57,350
Alright, I used up all my cards.

2261
01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:01,250
I used up all my cards.

2262
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:02,510
Alright guys.

2263
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:07,110
I can't fight any more of the children anymore guys.

2264
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:09,330
Wait, unless...

2265
01:37:09,330 --> 01:37:10,470
UNLESS!

2266
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:11,710
HAHAHAHAHA!

2267
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,170
HAHA!

2268
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,650
PAY TO FIGHT MORE CHILDREN!

2269
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,130
LET'S GO!

2270
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:21,930
HAHAHAHAHA!

2271
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:24,650
JK!

2272
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:29,070
I have the money to fight more!

2273
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,070
HAHAHAHAHA!

2274
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:33,570
HAHAHAHAHA!

2275
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,350
HAHAHA!

2276
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:37,570
That's right.

2277
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:38,250
Goodbye!

2278
01:37:38,770 --> 01:37:39,190
Hey!

2279
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:41,310
Nice!

2280
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:42,210
Go Tails!

2281
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,670
Go!

2282
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:44,830
I don't know if I can like...

2283
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:45,970
When do I...

2284
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,130
When does the curse stop?

2285
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:50,270
The ride never ends.

2286
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:52,090
HAHAHAHA!

2287
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:54,570
The ride never ends.

2288
01:37:55,810 --> 01:37:56,850
What's the lowest?

2289
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:58,590
Oh, the gnome.

2290
01:37:58,870 --> 01:37:59,910
We can't fast forward?

2291
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,910
We don't even get to see them fight?

2292
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:02,850
Fast forward.

2293
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:04,030
Yeah, I think I...

2294
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:04,950
Yeah, I think...

2295
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:05,490
HAHAHA!

2296
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:07,330
I think it's...

2297
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:09,910
We know what's gonna happen on this one too.

2298
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:14,870
You don't even deserve me watching it cause we know what's gonna happen.

2299
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:15,630
Goodbye.

2300
01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:17,330
HAHAHA!

2301
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:17,490
Yeah!

2302
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:18,570
HAHAHA!

2303
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:21,330
Yay!

2304
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:22,690
How did you...

2305
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:24,950
Default dead with the...

2306
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:26,350
One guy!

2307
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:28,290
With the one guy!

2308
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:28,830
You know what?

2309
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:30,010
No, let's watch you.

2310
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:30,850
Let's...

2311
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:31,530
Let's...

2312
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,630
You know what?

2313
01:38:33,350 --> 01:38:34,390
You know what?

2314
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:36,710
I feel a little generous here.

2315
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:38,490
Where's Tuxedo Man?

2316
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:40,890
Where are you?

2317
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:42,630
What color is Tuxedo Man?

2318
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:43,150
HAHAHA!

2319
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:43,990
The...

2320
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:45,270
The bat...

2321
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:46,590
Oh wait, it's a costume, right?

2322
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:48,050
That's a...

2323
01:38:48,050 --> 01:38:49,050
Bait tea.

2324
01:38:49,530 --> 01:38:49,690
HAHAHA!

2325
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,950
It's a costume, right?

2326
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:52,870
Okay.

2327
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,370
I need to remove you.

2328
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:56,470
Uh...

2329
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:57,170
HAHAHA!

2330
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:58,810
Alright.

2331
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,790
I don't want...

2332
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,710
It's...

2333
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:03,230
Does he...

2334
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:04,370
It's a costume, right guys?

2335
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:08,330
Spearman's top 500 goals right here.

2336
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:09,790
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2337
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,490
Alright.

2338
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:13,630
You know what?

2339
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:14,170
Let's go.

2340
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:15,670
There's no way.

2341
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:17,890
I got put on the costume.

2342
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,610
I'll be right back.

2343
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,050
HAHAHA!

2344
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:23,590
I'm not done with you.

2345
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:24,550
I'll be right back.

2346
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:25,550
HAHAHA!

2347
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:29,870
Where are you?

2348
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:31,090
Follow my lead!

2349
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:32,090
Nooo!

2350
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:33,170
Okay, wait.

2351
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:37,500
There we go.

2352
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:38,600
We did so much together.

2353
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,140
There we go.

2354
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:41,140
There we go.

2355
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,180
Nice.

2356
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,920
There we go.

2357
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:51,920
No, no!

2358
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:55,040
Alright, child!

2359
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,480
I'm coming back in!

2360
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,780
That's right, child!

2361
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,300
I'm coming back in!

2362
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:11,340
That's right.

2363
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,240
That's right.

2364
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,040
Oh, that's cute!

2365
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:20,280
618 versus 22,000!

2366
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:21,240
618 versus 22,000!

2367
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,320
Missed the meeting!

2368
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:27,500
The mirror match of the ages!

2369
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:27,960
The mirror match of the ages!

2370
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,260
Who will win?

2371
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:29,660
Yay!

2372
01:40:29,860 --> 01:40:31,320
I'm gold too!

2373
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,420
Yippee!

2374
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,280
I'm gold!

2375
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:36,800
Gold too!

2376
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,140
Oh my god, with the 2 million!

2377
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:42,040
Where are these... where's the children?

2378
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,800
There we go, there's the children.

2379
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,920
Alright, get back in here.

2380
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,820
I'm done playing with you.

2381
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,160
I'm done playing with you, gal.

2382
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,200
Alright, we all know what's gonna happen.

2383
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,660
There's no way.

2384
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:58,400
Nice!

2385
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,480
Alright, I just wanna make sure...

2386
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,280
I just wanna weed out the children out of here.

2387
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,360
So that everybody else will... WHAT?!

2388
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:11,600
No!

2389
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,180
No!

2390
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:16,980
No!

2391
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:18,820
How?!

2392
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,640
How do I...

2393
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:23,380
How do I...

2394
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:23,920
What happened?

2395
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:25,980
What?

2396
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:27,000
What happened?

2397
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,300
What happened?

2398
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,680
How did they...

2399
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,600
How did they stop me?

2400
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:37,620
How did they stop me?

2401
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:39,860
Is it cause they...

2402
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:40,100
OHHHH!

2403
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,960
That's how they stopped me!

2404
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,760
They fought back!

2405
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,640
The children fought back!

2406
01:41:51,620 --> 01:41:52,180
No...

2407
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:53,700
No...

2408
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:57,440
How did they stop Tails?

2409
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,160
No...

2410
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:03,680
70 D-Bucks...

2411
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:07,820
Cause their power level is 57,000!

2412
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,200
Of course I would fight him!

2413
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,460
My win streak...

2414
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,940
My win streak...

2415
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:16,200
My win streak...

2416
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:16,740
They...

2417
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:18,480
This is not fair.

2418
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,100
I can't even... I can't even rematch them!

2419
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,680
This is not fair.

2420
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,060
I can't... I can't even...

2421
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,120
What is your name?

2422
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,060
I will remember you.

2423
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:33,160
Thank you!

2424
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:36,600
Alright.

2425
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:37,880
Well that was fun.

2426
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,900
That was really fun.

2427
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:41,760
I...

2428
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:45,080
I had a great time.

2429
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:45,840
Honestly.

2430
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,440
That was fun trying out...

2431
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,420
Cookie Run for the very first time.

2432
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:55,520
You know what?

2433
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:57,740
No, we don't end on a loss.

2434
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,520
You're right guys.

2435
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,440
We don't end on a loss.

2436
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,920
Who's the... Refreshing.

2437
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:03,920
Alright.

2438
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,100
We don't end on a loss.

2439
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:05,660
You're right.

2440
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,180
You're right.

2441
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:12,390
You're right.

2442
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:13,730
We don't...

2443
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:19,230
You're absolutely right.

2444
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:24,210
Let me...

2445
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:26,430
Let me go all...

2446
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,370
You're right everybody.

2447
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:40,830
You're right.

2448
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:42,790
This is how we are ending.

2449
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:47,840
Hey!

2450
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:50,920
Hello.

2451
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,340
We did it!

2452
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,180
We did it!

2453
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:00,540
Yay!

2454
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,160
Alright.

2455
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,220
And that's how...

2456
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:07,140
And that's how we end the stream.

2457
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:08,580
That's how...

2458
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,740
It's not overkill.

2459
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:13,360
If the children...

2460
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,220
My dad works at Cookie Run.

2461
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:22,580
But yes.

2462
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:23,960
That was the new update.

2463
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,880
I hope you guys had a...

2464
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,120
Fun time.

2465
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,720
I had a great time trying out for the first time.

2466
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:32,160
Again...

2467
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,360

2468
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,320

I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

2481
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:04,340
I understand why this game is incredibly popular.

2482
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,780
Especially the designs.

2483
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,300
The designs.

2484
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:06,860
The designs are...

2485
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,820
The designs are really really pretty.

2486
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:11,700
I have to admit.

2487
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:15,280
I really like looking at all the character designs.

2488
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,200
Of the cookies.

2489
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:17,940
And obviously...

2490
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,800
So much love being put into this game.

2491
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:20,320
So yes.

2492
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,220
Thank you again.

2493
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,300
As always everybody.

2494
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:24,480
Stay hydrated.

2495
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:27,560
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2496
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,140
And if you stay up for me.

2497
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:30,020
Head to bed.

2498
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:31,640
Because you deserve it.

2499
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:33,100

2500
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,660
Bye guys.
