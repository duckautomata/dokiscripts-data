1
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Uh, hello.

2
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,220
Welcome to day three.

3
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,360
Welcome, welcome to day three.

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,740
I never expected to live this far, but here we are.

5
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,400
Day three of Minecraft Twitch Rivals!

6
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,800
Let's fucking go!

7
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,740
Good morning, everyone.

8
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,880
Good morning.

9
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,220
Give it up for day three!

10
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,940
Day fucking three!

11
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,960
Oh shit, sorry.

12
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,900
Oh my gosh.

13
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,320
I already misspoke the rule.

14
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Okay, so for those who don't know, today, they're enforcing rules more heavily.

15
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,920
So, other than the fact that we're not...

16
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,320
They're like, guys, they had like a...

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,340
Today, this morning, they had like...

18
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,140
They're enforcing...

19
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,860
They're like, we're gonna be enforcing rules now more strictly.

20
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
And then, so like other stuff, it's like understandable.

21
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,100
No metagaming, like no stream sniping, you know, stuff like that, that we don't do.

22
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,260
Um, and then they're like, I had no...

23
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,700
No mic spamming, like no playing copyright music.

24
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,080
Because remember yesterday, people were obnoxiously playing copyright music yesterday.

25
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,820
So they were like, no copyright music!

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,240
We're not allowed to like talk to people outside of the in-game voice chat, stuff like that.

27
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,820
Um, so because like people were talking, you know, people were interacting with like...

28
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,080
Apparently, some people were interacting on like Discord and stuff, like with Discord audio.

29
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,300
So like no voice proximity, which I was like, oh my god, that's so smart.

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,280
But also, oh my god, wait, that's cheating!

31
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,340
So they're enforcing that, but the one rule that stood out to me the most...

32
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,400
No profanity.

33
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,220
So...

34
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,240
So no more profanity for this bird.

35
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,940
So that was like one of the the five rules.

36
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,560
I don't know, five or six rules that they're trying to enforce.

37
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,100
Now, there was another one that interested me.

38
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,180
I'm not as like, isn't like, oh, I'm gonna do it.

39
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,580
But like one of them was like, uh, no, oh my gosh.

40
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,840
Okay, let me read it again.

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,300
I thought that rule was so interesting, because I'm like, wait, we're actually not allowed to do that?

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Let me, let me find it again.

43
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,560
It was actually, I was like, what, what the heck?

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,620
See, I'm, I'm learning.

45
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,560
But one of them, oh my gosh, where is it?

46
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,220
Where's the general announcement?

47
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,680
Oh, yeah, uh, unfair competition, negative behavior!

48
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,040
And dishonest acts are strictly forbidden!

49
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,460
So that means no gaslighting!

50
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:26,700
Players are expected to maintain a positive attitude towards fellow competitors.

51
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,180
And organizers to ensure a friendly environment.

52
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Okay, it doesn't say no gaslighting.

53
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,980
But there it says unfair competition and negative behavior and dishonest acts are strictly forbidden.

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,460
I assume that means you can't gaslight others.

55
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,540
I assume, I don't know if that's true or not.

56
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,420
But like, uh, but like, I assume that's what it means.

57
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,240
Because like, what does like, what does like, uh, what does like dishonest acts mean?

58
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,940
Or like, or like negative, like, what does that mean?

59
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,440
This is like that one guy that was like, this is the wrong house!

60
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,860
Does that count?

61
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,920
Like, is, remember when like, Gumi and I were running towards the house?

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,300
And then one of them was like, this, like, is, is fake comms considered dishonest?

63
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,440
Like, does that count?

64
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,480
I don't know!

65
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,380
But like, that rule is actually pretty freaking vague.

66
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay, I had to...

67
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,800
That rule was pretty freaking vague.

68
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,580
So like, I couldn't really tell what that actually meant.

69
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,180
Also, apparently, you're allowed...

70
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:55,560
You're allowed to rat out other prop players if you're a prop.

71
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,720
And like, that's messed up.

72
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,580
That's so, like, why?

73
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,900
Like, who would want to be a prop at that point?

74
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,740
Like, just eliminate a fellow prop player.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,720
Yeah, you're allowed to like, shout, like, rat other prop members out.

76
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,940
Okay, so the fourth game, the fourth...

77
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,120
Okay, wait, one, two...

78
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
Okay, sorry, the fifth game.

79
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,260
The fifth game is called, like, Duck Duck Curse or some shit.

80
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,100
I mean, some frick...

81
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm trying, okay?

82
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,080
I'm trying really hard.

83
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm not a Minecraft player, so that's built in.

84
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,820
Man, I'm an FPS gamer.

85
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:52,160
We've said, like, I've heard and said, like, so much profanity.

86
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,400
And I've heard so much worse.

87
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,640
Okay.

88
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,960
Anyway.

89
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,960
Anyway, so basically, it's like RNG, so we have to run around and find, like, curse dolls.

90
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,920
And then, we have to, like...

91
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,340
But the thing is, the curse doll can either be safe or a curse.

92
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,400
So, it's like RNG.

93
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,300
So you don't know if you're gonna get the curse or the safe doll.

94
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,240
And then, we find the curse doll, you have to run away.

95
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,340
Because, like, I assume they look like this.

96
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,080
I assume, because these look like curse dolls.

97
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,080
So, like, you have to, like, run away.

98
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,760
And if you get caught, you get eliminated.

99
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,100
Oh my gosh, if I get eliminated on the first game.

100
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,740
Oh my gosh.

101
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,780
Freedom.

102
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,280
I mean, it'd be fun if day four...

103
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Anyway, freedom is so close.

104
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,080
Anyway, day...

105
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,280
Okay, game five...

106
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,980
Game five is 10 people will be eliminated.

107
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,680
But game six, 30 people will be eliminated.

108
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:14,900
Right now, players are arguing with the organizers on whether or not you should be allowed to rat out other prop players.

109
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,840
Because one of them was, like...

110
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,800
I saw people using the rules against the admins.

111
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,600
And was like, ratting other prop members is negative behavior.

112
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
So vague.

113
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,920
Like, that's what I'm saying.

114
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,160
Those rules are so goddamn vague.

115
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,120
So, like, I see, like, people in the server, the discord chat was like, that is negative behavior.

116
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,760
Because it's griefing other players.

117
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,700
So...

118
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Um...

119
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,580
It's, like, dishonest.

120
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,220
It ruins competitive integrity.

121
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,140
So, like, the admins and, like, the players are, like, arguing right now about it.

122
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,820
That's why we're not starting it, I think.

123
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,980
I think...

124
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
There's 94 players?

125
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,920
Oh, that means, like, all of them are just admins.

126
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,120
I was gonna be like, how is there 94 players?

127
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,000
There should be only 80 players.

128
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,460
How is there, like, so many admins?

129
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,040
It's...

130
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,100
Not the competitive integrity.

131
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,620
That's why we're not starting it.

132
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,120
Because people are, like, arguing right now about the rules for the second game.

133
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
I mean, I mean, that's what I'm saying.

134
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,540
It's so vague.

135
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,100
Like, what counts as...

136
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,320
What counts as competitive and, like, what counts as negative behavior?

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,320
It's so goddamn vague.

138
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,260
uh Uh, oh, weird.

139
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,420
They're making changes to the launcher.

140
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,840
All right.

141
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,680
Okay.

142
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,520
All right.

143
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,160
I don't know.

144
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,900
Yeah, and apparently...

145
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,500
Okay, one other funny thing is that, uh, um, people were complaining about the copyright music that was being played yesterday.

146
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,540
Like, whoever that little hacker was that...

147
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,140
That that...

148
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:31,920
Um, because like apparently people like uploaded their bods and got copyright striked Yeah, like whoever, like whoever that was, I don't know if they're still in this lobby But people were complaining because they're like, we got a copyright strike because someone,

149
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:55,660
someone got like, um Someone, you know, people were playing copyright music So people were like, bro, I got a strike, bro, I got a claim, I can't monetize it So yeah, I thought that was, well, to me it was funny, but like obviously that sucks man

150
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,000
Like, that sucks bro, but like to me that was pretty funny

151
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:21,020
Alright, I guess, I guess we should, I guess we cannot take meds for a little bit But, where is everybody?

152
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,320
There should be like 90 players Where is Gumi?

153
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:41,780
I need, I need her to clutch it for me I need her, I need her to, I need her to like move on to day 4 for me and suffer Alright, where's me?

154
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,260

Oh my god, all the D's are almost dead Except for me!

156
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,500
Yay!

157
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:04,020
It's not metagaming because it's happening in-game We're just not allowed to metagame outside, like outside of the game

158
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,660
Guys, guys, oh my god, do you see that?

159
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:22,100
Guys, it's already getting spicy in the server People are already playing music in the lobby, can we please stop that?

160
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,030
Oh no, it's already getting spicy

161
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:58,930
Oh my god, they have to write it in Spanish too because they don't know They don't know, they just, it was a language barrier or not To be fair, the complaints of it was mostly in English, so I don't know if like the people, the Spanish players knew that that was not allowed Oh my god,

162
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:25,050
you got called out in two languages Oh my god, in front of everybody Oh my god, in front of everyone Holy shit, oh shoot, holy shit Oh my god, wait, Gumi's in the kitchen Gumi's gonna carry me, right?

164
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:40,390
Liars, there's no Gumi in here Oh, but there is a TV She's in the dining hall?

165
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:48,190
This is not, that's not a kitchen Guys, you guys need to know where, you guys need to know the difference between a kitchen and a dining hall

166
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:55,930
What?

167
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,730
Actually, oh my gosh What is the admin calling out about now?

168
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:22,480
Oh my god, the callouts are real The callouts are real I told you guys, they're enforcing the rules, like legit now Gumi!

169
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,020
Gumi, you didn't share one?

170
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Get in the backpack, get in Yay Hey, I never told you this, but your skin, you put it on wrong I know, I can't peep, I know since day one, but I can't peep

171
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,360
It's okay, as long as the front works, that's all that matters Yeah,

172
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,220
for free Okie dokie

173
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,280
Gumi, did you see the harder enforcement of rules today?

174
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,640
Did you see that?

175
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,620
No swearing

176
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,000
Today will probably be the most RNG day, I think Gumi!

177
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,260
Gumi!

178
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,540
I'm so tired already

179
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:41,460
The thing is, I don't know if you get eliminated as a hider, as a prop hider How do the hunters get eliminated then?

180
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:50,480
I don't understand, why would the prop players want to call each other Why would the prop players call out other prop players?

181
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,220
Because how would the hunters die?

182
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:08,760
Like, I feel, that's just, that's just dumb Hey Gumi, do you understand the prop hunt thing on how it's getting I thought prop hunt would be like a team game, but did you see people were arguing about whether or not you can call, like, throw other prop players under the bus?

183
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:20,860
To get eliminated Um, I did see that Yeah, so I'm confused, I thought the prop hunt was a team based game No, I think it's a one for all A one, but then how would the hunters get eliminated?

184
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:42,760
I guess like If they don't hunt enough, if they don't get at least one person or something Yeah, but then like, prop players can get eliminated by like, you know, getting caught So like, how would That's so confusing So like, it's better, it's just better to be a hunter than a prop player Hello Yeah And Frost,

185
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:49,960
I have 28 Oh, for an important, oh, important announcement Server restarting?

186
00:17:50,120 --> 00:18:06,580
Oh, they're restarting the server Guys, I thought, I, oh, I wish it was a team game Any music of any kind is not allowed in voice chat Nooooo Nooooo Why are you guys complaining about Minecraft players?

187
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm just like Yeah, I'm just like, why does it matter?

188
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:45,360
I'm so confused Why would it matter if you can't play I wanna play music in voice chat Just play music in your own stream That doesn't make sense to me I'm sorry, I'm not, I don't understand Guys, I actually don't understand

189
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,240
Voice chat will be completely disabled by the server in, oh, in prop hunt Oh

190
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,260
Hello?

191
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,820
Hey So So Yeah?

192
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:31,900
I found out, okay, so they're turning off voice chat for the prop hunt thing so we don't grief each other Yeah I'm pretty sure it's like, hunters have to at least get one I'm pretty sure it's gonna be a really big house So like, it makes it even that hunters only have to get one and props have to survive I'm just like,

193
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:48,760
the transform run is just so confusing I'm just But I also don't like that we have to do tasks Yeah, you have to do tasks as a prop So it feels like it's better to be a hunter than a prop Cause it's easier to grab, like, hunt props Than it is to like,

194
00:19:49,180 --> 00:20:06,820
be a prop And then you have to like, make sure you don't get caught while doing tasks Cause I feel like props get eliminated so fast because of it Yeah, I agree Yeah, that's why I was like, so confused It would've been better if it was just a team game And then like,

195
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:28,440
all the props are like, if the hunters win and get everybody All the props would win on one side Cause then it's more RNG And like, people can actually work together Yeah, it's kinda like, you're trying to think of like, prop hunt rules Yeah Yeah Cause I feel like it's hard to eliminate...

196
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:40,960
Cause it's just better to be RNG'd as a hunter Than it is to be RNG'd as a prop Cause like, what if you just don't do anything What if you just do one task and then like...

197
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,920
Or like, what if all the prop players successfully do all the tasks And not like...

198
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,840
It's just confusing!

199
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,880
Are you in the lobby now?

200
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:06,560
Um, I'm launching Yeah, yeah, cause, you know, you see the new forum They're like, nobody is allowed to use third party I was like, people were using Discord?

201
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:15,200
Dude, I thought that shit wasn't allowed Like, from day one Yeah, and then I'm like, did they get disqualified?

202
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,220
Or are they still in the game?

203
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm like, that's pretty unfair They're using Discord groups I have to deal with 100 people spamming my lobby And they get to be in a Discord group?

204
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Yeah, what's it called?

205
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,460
I found out that in-game...

206
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:56,240
I forgot that in-game voice Yeah, it has a group chat Yeah, I disabled it Yeah, I asked a question about it They're like, no, not allowed Yeah, so for chat, for those who don't know This is actually not allowed, the group voice chat Even though it's in the game It's not allowed Because they want to be fair They want everybody to have...

207
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:18,240
To use voice proximity Alright, I'm launching now Alright, I'll see you in-game Okay, bye bye Bye bye Guys, I'm pretty sure Guys If we make it to the second game If I get propped, it's over

208
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,280
If I get propped, it's so over

209
00:22:30,260 --> 00:23:14,320
Guys, they actually have to disable the voice chat So it's emotes mode only In the transform In the prop hut No, we have to do tasks Dude, if we're propped We have to do tasks So we can't stay propped forever We have to move around And do stuff And that's what I'm saying If we get propped The RNG is so bad Because the hunter just have to camp I guess if they don't know the tasks They can't camp it But it feels like it's easier To be a hunter Yeah!

210
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,000
The hunter advantage

211
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,420
It's so...

212
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:42,340
Oh my god, it's so big 30 people will be eliminated And transported to prop hut 2 Because I'm like thinking I honestly thought it was supposed to be a team game That's like legit That's what I thought I was like, oh my gosh, it's like a team game Because like Because like Whoever,

213
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:54,840
whichever side wins They get to move on But no, it's not a team game It's not It's not a team game It's a one for all

214
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:36,100
It's a one for all Every Every hunter Every hunter And prop for themselves Chat Alright Let's see They're completely disabling voice chat So other props Other props can't throw Other props can't throw each other out To get eliminated fast That just makes me wonder I guess like props That have the least completed task Get eliminated But then like what if there's like

215
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:55,640
I'm just like thinking like I'm just thinking like what if we have this like what if we have more more members?

216
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:15,220
Like I guess we'll have to do tiebreakers Because what if like there's hunters that got like zero kills And there's props that done zero tasks but like Zero tasks, but there's like more How do you eliminate all the gardens look the same in mine eyes?

217
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,600
Yeah, I brought us in a wrong side.

218
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,320
Oh my god Is there a third one there she's running us around

219
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,600
And give me a zero Yeah

220
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,240

Oh my god.

255
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,770
People are admin mad.

256
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,110
Admin's actually mad.

257
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,410
They're like, alright, we're actually gonna remove people now.

258
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,730
You keep playing music?

259
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,210
Oh my god, guys.

260
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,150
I'm going to start snitching.

261
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,850
Oh my god, it's time.

262
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,630
It's time to start my jokey arc and start snitching.

263
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,770
Quit playing music and be free.

264
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:33,470
No, no.

265
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,370
If I can, like, catch people.

266
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:43,130
If I can catch people playing music, one less person to worry about.

267
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,890
No negativity, remember?

268
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,050
It's not negativity.

269
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,450
I'm looking at the competitive integrity of this game.

270
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,310
Oh my god, you're right.

271
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,910
If I play- That's actually messed up.

272
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,710
Whoever- That's like a brilliant plan.

273
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,370
Like, oh my god, a villain came up with this perfect plan.

274
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,090
That's when you know I'm not a villain.

275
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:17,070
It's the fact that I'm not an actual villain because even I wouldn't have come up with that.

276
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,350
But some of my chat was like, quick, play music over a group of people and call somebody out.

277
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,730
That's so evil.

278
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,010
That's actually so goddamn evil.

279
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,850
Oh my god.

280
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,610
You, sir, are a very evil person.

281
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:44,470
That's so- Guys, the Among Us part of this game ended, chat.

282
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:51,570
Oh my god, we're 30 minutes late because the server is messed up at the moment.

283
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,190
Alright, let's see.

284
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,870
What was the info?

285
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,190
Ooh, okay.

286
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,490
Interesting.

287
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,290
Guys,

288
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,690
we got insider info.

289
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,890
I'm gonna snitch them out for it.

290
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,210
You heard the secrets too?

291
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,270
Yeah.

292
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,850
We're being spied on, June.

293
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,090
Is the TV up there?

294
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,930
No, there is a TV up there, though, if you need to get that.

295
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,410
Oh, I got that one.

296
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,290
I got three secret guys.

297
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,070
Oh, you're in one that I haven't found.

298
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,770
What are you gonna do?

299
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,990
Uninstall the info from my brain?

300
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,890
Oh, thank god!

301
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,430
Oh my god.

302
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,470
I'm gonna snitch them.

303
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,390
I'm gonna snitch them out to the admins.

304
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:15,010
One of your admins gave the other player insider info, so she was metagaming!

305
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,430
She was metagaming!

306
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,330
Rule number 33!

307
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,310
I don't know where any more are.

308
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,250
Oh my god!

309
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,510
Gumi, Gumi, Gumi, I heard insider info from somebody that's apparently friends with the admin.

310
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:43,330
They were telling one player that the doll is gonna get faster and faster each round.

311
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,130
The evil doll.

312
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,870
It's like hide-and-seek tag.

314
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,250
Like musical chairs.

315
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, musical chairs with hide-and-seek.

316
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,630
So like, if you are unlucky and you get a bad doll, you have to start hiding.

317
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:16,350
Yeah, you know, I find it funny, Anne, how we were saying we want to search everywhere but the black corner, and that's exactly where it was.

318
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,230
Does it really matter, though?

319
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:27,370
Wait, I'm at 102.

320
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:28,790
Woah!

321
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,470
They did also, I know they did turn down the default render distance as well.

322
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,130
I turned it back up, though, because I just wasn't rendering the whole lobby.

323
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,670
Yeah, I turned down the render distance just because I didn't need that much.

324
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,030
I might turn it back down, to be honest.

325
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,010
I'm at like 8.

326
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,650
I'm gonna see if people are still complaining about the music.

327
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,990
I don't think it matters if the frames are low.

328
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,610
Yeah, but we're not talking during the game, we're just talking while we wait for the event to start.

329
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,610
I'm around like 2,000 render distance right now.

330
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,670
Yeah, I did the same thing, I feel like they're talking about us.

331
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,790
So how's the rest week?

332
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,390
Well, I've been in a server with 100 plus people for like three days straight.

333
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,090
Oh my god, guys, look, goodnight right there!

334
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:23,630
My social media is gone.

335
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,250
My social battery is not okay at the moment.

336
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,990
It's not okay.

337
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,990
Sounds like the opposite of resting.

338
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,570
Oh my god, 10 seconds.

339
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,190
10 seconds, guys.

340
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,890
Oh my god, I cannot wait.

341
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,210
I cannot wait to be the first 10 out.

342
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,110
I cannot wait, guys!

343
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,390
Illuminated guy!

344
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:29,850
Oh wait.

345
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,910
All on red!

346
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,870
All on red!

347
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,610
All on red!

348
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,530
I need to take my meds too.

349
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,110
I should take my meds too.

350
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,130
The voices, they're getting louder!

351
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,390
I wonder, are they gonna TPS based off of what color we're standing on?

352
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,370
Yeah, yeah, sure.

353
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,110
Oh, I have an idea.

354
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,550
If we both...

355
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:16,030
If we both pick the same doll, the doll will only kill one of us.

356
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,370
That sounds like the most...

357
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,470
Worst idea you've ever come up with.

358
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,290
But like, that's why it's a 50-50.

359
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,210
No, it sounds like you're a dumb...

360
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,850
You can't swear in profanity!

361
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,450
Rule 12!

362
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,130
What were you gonna say?

363
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:35,830
Dumb what?

364
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,570
Dumb what?

365
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,330
Just dumb, you're just dumb.

366
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,490
I feel like there was a second word there.

367
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,210
Dumb bear, dumb bear, dumb bear, dumb bear.

368
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,630
All I'm saying is that the doll will only pick one of us.

369
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,350
I think it's a good plan, I don't understand.

370
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,670
You're the same person who doesn't know how to read.

371
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,070
Yeah, but that doesn't require reading, it's just probability.

372
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,110
It's just probability.

373
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,370
It's probability, it's math.

374
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,970
We're trying to deal with math, right?

375
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,110
We're next to the...

376
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,350
Wait, the Spanish players know what they're doing.

377
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:30,870
Oh my god, it's like roulette!

378
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,210
Wait, what?

379
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,350
Oh my god.

380
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,890
Wait, that's so scary.

381
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,370
This is literally RNG.

382
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,790
Oh, I hate this, my stress is already going up.

383
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,450
My stress is already going up, I hate this.

384
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,410
I'm already anxious.

385
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,730
I'm gonna report this to Catherine.

386
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,390
What?

387
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,170
There are only five dolls of this type left?

388
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,070
Bro, what?

389
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,890
Wait, then everybody could like...

390
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,850
Wait, then how do you live?

391
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,090
You just run around in a circle?

392
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,150
Circle?

393
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,470
Bro, what the heck?

394
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,550
That's so scary!

395
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,310
That's gonna be me.

396
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,090
What?

397
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,950
Wait.

398
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,470
Wait.

399
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,850
Can they like...

400
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,790
Can they like open the place?

401
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,370
Oh!

402
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,350
Wait, that's dumb!

403
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,950
Wait, that's... what if like...

404
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,710
Oh, that's so disgusting.

405
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,590
I'm already stressed out listening to this.

406
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,850
What?

407
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,270
Let's gotcha!

408
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,590
Let's gotcha!

409
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,370
I'm gonna use all of them so no one can hide.

410
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,270
That's so true.

411
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,750
That's actually so scary.

412
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,990
Oh my gosh, that's actually so scary.

413
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,090
What?

414
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,750
Oh my gosh.

415
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,350
Wait, wait, wait.

416
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,970
It's only if you choose the doll that's...

417
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,990
I'm listening to other people's strats.

418
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,170
I'm listening to other people's strats right now.

419
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,530
Yes!

420
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,950
The fridge is gonna save us!

421
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,630
Yeah.

422
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,350
So we're gonna put the same square together?

423
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:35,970
Really?

424
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,990
Use the hiding spots later.

425
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,030
Oh, okay.

426
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,710
But what if like...

427
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,190
But if we use up all the hiding spaces, then nobody can get it.

428
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,450
Yeah, but that means you also can't get it, idiot.

429
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,790
Yeah, but the probability wise.

430
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,590
Yeah, I don't think it matters where you stay.

431
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,250
I feel like...

432
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,710
I don't know.

433
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,630
I don't know.

434
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,590
Can we all agree not to use the hiding cluster later in the game?

435
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,010
Let's use the hiding cluster.

436
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,890
Is everybody in the room?

437
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,630
Why would it be...

438
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,470
No, I shouldn't stick with the pros because the pros are faster runners.

439
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,570
Why don't you play DbD and just break their ankles, man?

440
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,810
All I'm saying, guys, you know what that doesn't...

441
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:37,450
Guys, if I always stick with the pros, if we get RNG into a core stall, all of them are better players than me and they would kill me first.

442
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,530
They're faster runners.

443
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,290
Oh, wow, holy frick.

444
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,590
Yeah, that's why I'm scared.

445
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,090
Do you want to be in the big room?

446
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,850
So just spread out.

447
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,750
What happens if not surviving?

448
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,690
My container desk is messing me up, guys.

449
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,250
Yeah, I think everybody goes there.

450
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,850
I can survive if it's yours.

451
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,770
Those voices are so strong!

452
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,330
I can't.

453
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,310
I can't.

454
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,130
I survived.

455
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,530
I'm surprised I survived as long as I could.

456
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,210
I'm surprised I survived this long.

457
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,910
It was just... it was a lot.

458
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,570
It was a lot.

459
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,330
Alright, if I stick with... I think I'm gonna stick with the crowd, then.

460
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:52,250
The more people... I guess the more people there are in that space...

461
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,070
The...

462
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,260
What was everybody voting for?

463
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,000
If there's a huge amount of people together...

464
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,180
Then, like, probability-wise, maybe?

465
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,140
The stress!

466
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,560
We all suffer the same fate together.

467
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,140
Oh, God.

468
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,520
I'm actually anxious.

469
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,720
I don't know why.

470
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,400
I don't know why I'm so anxious.

471
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,980
No!

472
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,370
There are only one doll?!

473
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:51,850
That's messed up.

474
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,910
That's actually messed up, guys.

475
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,010
That's so messed up.

476
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,070
I'm so...

477
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,710
That's so messed up.

478
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,780
How did... How did I...

479
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,810
Oh, my.

480
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,070
It's... Oh, Chris.

481
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,390
It's me.

482
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,450
It always happens.

483
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,990
To Doki!

484
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,540
The Doki experience.

485
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,300
Right here.

486
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,860
The Doki experience right now.

487
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,440
This is the Doki experience.

488
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,220
Oh, wait.

489
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,140
Everybody's running.

490
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,100
Why is everybody running right now?

491
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,560
Five minutes of this...

492
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,980
FIVE MINUTES OF THIS?!

493
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:54,060
If I stand in the middle...

494
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,540
Oh, no.

495
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,060
A lot of people are running away.

496
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,680
So that, like, makes me really nervous.

497
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,300
Like, why are people running away?

498
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,810
I want to stay near the crowd.

499
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:10,950
Audio for you.

500
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,410
I'm running.

501
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:18,930
I'm running.

502
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,090
Why are you running?

503
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,470
Why are you running?

504
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:21,410
Because it's coming.

505
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,890
Intel.

506
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:24,670
Intel.

507
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:25,450
Intel.

508
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:26,190
Intel.

509
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:26,850
Intel.

510
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,290
Intel.

511
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:27,630
Intel.

512
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,450
I didn't know if you were just getting your steps in.

513
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:30,650
Oh, my God.

514
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,970
Yay, free Intel!

515
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,290
The herd mentality!

516
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,610
I love following the herd!

517
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,210
Are you guys trolling?

518
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,590
FOLLOW THE HERD!

519
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:48,830
What does it mean if you're even safe?

520
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:52,030
M, what does Sigma mean?

521
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:52,470
Follow the herd.

522
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,210
Mob is strong to get in.

523
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,670
I like crowds, personally.

524
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,230
Mob is strong to get in there.

525
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:03,710
Guys, stop laughing.

526
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,130
Two minutes.

527
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,730
Two minutes for you.

528
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:06,570
Just hold.

529
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:07,150
Hold.

530
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:07,650
Hold.

531
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:08,610
Holy, this is abnormal.

532
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,670
I'm lying.

533
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:13,270
Serpio is abnormal.

534
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,490
Mob is strong to get in.

535
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,170
No, don't do it!

536
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:19,770
No!

537
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,690
Oh, my God.

538
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:21,290
Oh, my God.

539
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,770
No, that was aura, bro.

540
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,310
Bro, that was aura.

541
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,910
Plus 1,000 aura.

542
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,730
Is it coming?

543
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,790
Kill someone, bro.

544
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:33,710
Just kill someone.

545
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,270
Just kill my mate.

546
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,430
This doll got one-tapped, man.

547
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:39,530
Is it coming?

548
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,270
I'm worried at the end.

549
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,370
All 40 of us in here are gonna be the ones to get out.

550
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,450
If no one dies, there's gonna be 10 rounds until someone dies.

551
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,050
Like, 15 minutes.

552
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,470
Yeah, we all win.

553
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,450
They have to split the money.

554
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,570
They give us each $70,000.

555
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,790
Can we vote someone to be like $70,000?

556
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,430
Not it.

557
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,190
Not it.

558
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,070
Did not mean.

559
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,410
Okay, fine.

560
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:09,370
We'll sacrifice Andre.

561
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,650
This has to be the longest 2 minutes.

562
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,910
Yo, I'll sacrifice for 40 Gs.

563
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:15,650
What?

564
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,130
This sucks.

565
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:20,910
Sorry.

566
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,110
I'm actually losing it.

567
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,070
It's so...

568
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,950
I'm stuck in purgatory!

569
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:35,810
This is...

570
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:36,030
Ah!

571
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,410
Freaking purgatory!

572
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,950
I think it was the color that had the most people.

573
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,670
I don't know.

574
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:42,770
Yeah, yeah, of course.

575
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,510
I mean, it's the color that has the most votes.

576
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,650
It's gonna increase its speed.

577
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:50,530
The doll.

578
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:51,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

579
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,430
Dude, I'm nervous.

580
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:53,850
I don't know.

581
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,930
I don't know where it is.

582
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:56,390
I don't know.

583
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,010
How is there only one person and then we're free?

584
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,090
That's so mean!

585
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:07,650
Polo!

586
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,330
Polo!

587
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,410
Marco!

588
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:12,970
Polo!

589
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,690
Guys, always go together to the same color, okay?

590
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,250
If you are with a...

591
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,050
It's coming!

592
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:19,810
It's coming!

593
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,010
Yeah, he's going!

594
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:22,570
He's going!

595
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,390
Fuck the pickle.

596
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,790
Polo!

597
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,050
Polo!

598
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,790
Just stand in the back.

599
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:30,950
Behind us!

600
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,630
He's right behind me, isn't he?

601
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,470
Everybody run!

602
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,650
I was here earlier.

603
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,770
I don't know if he's still chilling.

604
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,010
Let's run into it!

605
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,250
Oh my god!

606
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,750
Oh my god!

607
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,190
It hit me!

608
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:47,770
It hit me!

609
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,030
I saw somebody got hit!

610
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:54,290
What?

611
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,390
They didn't get one?

612
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,210
How do I come back to the room?

613
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:03,610
I got hit twice by it.

614
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,150
Oh my god!

615
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,050
My health restored!

616
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,010
That's so stressful!

617
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,450
That was so stressful!

618
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,670
Where is the entrance?

619
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:18,790
TPS!

620
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:19,170
TPS!

621
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,250
Oh, it's here.

622
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,790
Oh, we're back.

623
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:23,930
Okay.

624
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,230
Do we go out on the same line?

625
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,330
Purple!

626
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,350
Blue!

627
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:35,990
Blue!

628
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:39,570
Blue!

629
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,150
Blue!

630
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:43,050
Blue!

631
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,230
It's okay.

632
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,850
There's a crowd.

633
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,570
There's a crowd.

634
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,910
It's gonna be me, right?

635
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:05,650
It's gonna be me.

636
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:07,990
I'm okay!

637
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,430
I'm okay!

638
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:16,750
Nice!

639
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,970
Wait, all of us have chosen safe?

640
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:19,330
Grey!

641
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,250
Grey!

642
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,470
Wait, what?

643
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:22,570
Grey!

644
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:23,310
Grey!

645
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,550
We already chose this!

646
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,210
We already chose this!

647
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:29,510
Grey is bad!

648
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,270
Grey is bad!

649
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,130
It's gonna be me!

650
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,250
It's gonna be me!

651
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:39,370
I mean, at least there's no RNG on what we choose.

652
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,290
Everybody gets a prize.

653
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,850
There's a huge crowd here.

654
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,070
Okay.

655
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,830
I'm confused.

656
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,370
What?

657
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:52,730
No!

658
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:57,730
That's me, right?

659
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,780
Okay, bye-bye!

660
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,700
That's me!

661
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,260
That's me!

662
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,840
This thing is fast.

663
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,280
Is that all of us?

664
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,140
Wait, is it like majority?

665
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,240
I'm so confused.

666
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,480
It's for everybody!

667
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:23,980
I'm dead!

668
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,360
I'm dead!

669
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,860
I hear him!

670
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,160
I hear him!

671
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,620
I'd rather stay with the group.

672
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,740
I hear him!

673
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,560
I hear him!

674
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,620
We got this.

675
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,280
Oh, there's a group there.

676
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:35,940
Nice.

677
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:36,420
Oh!

678
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,100
Oh!

679
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Oh!

680
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,760
Coming!

681
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,900
Coming!

682
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,140
Coming!

683
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,340
He's coming!

684
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,260
He's coming!

685
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,480
This doll is gonna have a different ability than the last one.

686
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,320
So we don't know how...

687
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,000
He's gonna have Aura.

688
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,140
This doll has kill Aura.

689
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,180
He's coming or not?

690
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,560
Is she coming?

691
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,220
Don't attract her!

692
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,060
Don't attract her!

693
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,600
So you might not be able to outrun her.

694
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,560
I'm sure you can kill her.

695
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,260
Oh my god!

696
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,340
He's coming!

697
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:06,920
He's coming!

698
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,360
He's coming!

699
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,440
He's coming!

700
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,040
I got you.

701
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:11,960
Oh!

702
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,460
He's got somebody!

703
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,720
I give it!

704
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,520
I give it!

705
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,260
I give it!

706
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:19,560
I give it!

707
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,300
I give it!

708
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,340
Oh my god!

709
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,220
Oh my god!

710
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,000
Another round!

711
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,920
At least we won't have to be here for 15 minutes.

712
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,760
We played!

713
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,500
We played!

714
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,600
We eliminated!

715
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,880
The save dolls are just pointless.

716
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,520
This is so stressful.

717
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,160
Yeah, it's bad.

718
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,720
Oh man.

719
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,660
Gray's bad.

720
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,860
This part doesn't matter.

721
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,900
And the save dolls don't matter.

722
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,400
Do not go back to the middle.

723
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,100
I was getting nailed.

724
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,500
I was getting scared.

725
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,380
I was alone.

726
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:58,920
Purple!

727
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,580
Purple!

728
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:00,720
Purple!

729
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:01,260
Purple!

730
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Purple!

731
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:01,800
Purple!

732
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:02,460
Purple!

733
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:03,860
Purple!

734
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Purple!

735
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,750
We're back.

736
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,730
Just fucking run!

737
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,170
Just run!

738
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:24,890
Just run!

739
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:28,910
Let's keep running.

740
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,810
I can't go to the intersection.

741
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:31,730
Follow Pumi.

742
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,030
Just follow Pumi.

743
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:35,450
Who's the hero?

744
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,590
I don't like this.

745
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,470
Just keep swimming.

746
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,530
Just keep swimming.

747
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:50,630
Just keep swimming.

748
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,910
I don't like that.

749
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,990
Are you running or what?

750
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,010
Are you running?

751
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,570
No, no, we're fine.

752
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,790
It's a terrible spot.

753
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,130
It's a terrible spot.

754
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,130
It's actually not terrible.

755
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,290
It's a terrible spot.

756
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,550
No, it's the best spot.

757
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:11,090
Guys, I'm scared.

758
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,010
I don't want to die.

759
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,830
Run for the doll!

760
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,290
Run for the doll!

761
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,690
Purple!

762
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,090
I'm serious!

763
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:31,770
The cry of help, though.

764
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,490
The cry of help.

765
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,730
I'm serious!

766
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,110
There are multiple.

767
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,290
Oh my god.

768
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:42,610
There were two before.

769
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,590
Oh my god.

770
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,530
Hold the corner!

771
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,650
The cry of help.

772
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,270
Don't chase him!

773
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,070
Don't chase him!

774
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:56,710
Cunning!

775
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,170
Fear!

776
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,270
Cunning!

777
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,030
Fear!

778
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,030
What is going on?

779
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,830
Absolute fear and mayhem.

780
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:08,130
That's what.

781
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,990
That's what's going on.

782
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,130
What is going on?

783
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,350
This is like the Stanford Prison Experiment.

784
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,470
Don't try to play it.

785
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,370
I swear.

786
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,670
That researchers are going to study this.

787
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,070
I'm going with this game.

788
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,110
I'm going with this game.

789
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,630
Oh no.

790
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:42,950
Oh god.

791
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,070
Oh my god.

792
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,990
I peaced away from the group.

793
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,910
I peaced away from the group.

794
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,310
I peaced away from the group.

795
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,930
I'm so scared.

796
00:56:58,990 --> 00:56:59,210
No.

797
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,610
Oh my god.

798
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:05,890
Oh my god.

799
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:06,490
There are multiple.

800
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,210
Oh my god.

801
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:11,450
Oh my god.

802
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:12,050
We are trapped.

803
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:13,490
There are multiple.

804
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,290
Oh my god.

805
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,850
We got so lucky.

806
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,010
Oh my god.

807
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,170
We got so lucky.

808
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:27,670
Oh my god.

809
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:33,010
What is the point of the safe dolls?

810
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,710
I still don't understand the game.

811
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,250
What is the point of the safe dolls?

812
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,750
Everybody has to run.

813
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,030
Yeah.

814
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,010
There is no point in having a safe doll.

815
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,430
If people are going to die, you got this.

816
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:04,730
Safe doll delays the game.

817
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,730
And I feel like...

818
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,810
Here we go again.

819
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,890
It doesn't matter.

820
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,650
It's majority.

821
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:19,830
It's always majority.

822
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:20,870
That's the thing.

823
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,350
It doesn't matter, guys.

824
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,290
It's there that majority picks.

825
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:27,170
Everybody still has to run.

826
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,590
So it doesn't matter if you pick a safe doll.

827
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,990
If the majority picks a bad doll, it's over.

828
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:38,890
I'll watch this corner too.

829
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,590
Keep a big group over there.

830
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:42,930
I'll stay here.

831
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,270
I'll stay here.

832
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,450
No matter what, somebody has to die.

833
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,770
Andres, I hope you know we're sacrificing you for us.

834
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:50,990
No, no, no.

835
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:53,670
No, no, no.

836
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,710
Guys, eight more to go.

837
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,410
We have eight more to go.

838
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,510
I'm good.

839
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,570
I'm good.

840
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:01,810
I'm fine.

841
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,870
Guys, there's nothing here.

842
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:04,930
Can we peek further if it's over?

843
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,490
No!

844
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,330
There's like eight more dolls to go.

845
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:10,670
They're coming.

846
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:10,930
They're coming.

847
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:11,610
We're coming.

848
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:25,750
I hope it means the dolls are fast.

849
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,310
They kill people faster.

850
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,650
Because each round is faster.

851
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:30,930
I'm so scared.

852
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,290
I don't know why they're trying to find things.

853
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,710
Oh, we're so good.

854
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,070
I don't know.

855
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:36,870
Hi.

856
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,110
Apparently the suits are not very safe.

857
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,950
They're running on the left.

858
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,890
They'll camp you.

859
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,250
They'll camp you?

860
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:50,230
Then there's no point in having hiding spots.

861
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:51,630
Okay, you know what?

862
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,190
Run, run, run, run, run.

863
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:56,650
They're beaches.

864
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,050
Okay, okay, okay.

865
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:00,910
My heart.

866
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,870
My poor heart.

867
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,930
I don't know where it went.

868
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,190
We're chilling, guys.

869
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:15,870
We're locked in.

870
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,470
It looks like we're okay.

871
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:19,470
Play the corner.

872
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,110
Hold the corner.

873
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:25,390
How many hearts?

874
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:26,950
It does half a heart.

875
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,750
You can get hit four times.

876
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,530
Yeah, me too.

877
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,490
Take one from the team.

878
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:31,170
Take one from the team.

879
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,070
I'm chilling.

880
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:36,150
I'm chilling.

881
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:37,810
My therapy.

882
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,570
Sam, Sam.

883
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,830
Are you running?

884
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:44,630
Are you safe?

885
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,990
There's two dolls that direction, but they turned left.

886
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,050
There's two dolls that direction.

887
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,910
I think we're good over here right now.

888
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,130
Are they faster than you running?

889
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,930
You can outrun them right now.

890
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,150
The dolls will find you.

891
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,430
Leave the group.

892
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,610
I left the group and I got fucking tapped.

893
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,350
Okay, okay, okay.

894
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:04,990
Together, always.

895
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:05,950
Siempre juntos.

896
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:08,390
Always together.

897
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,550
Siempre juntos.

898
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:12,510
Sacrifice Doki.

899
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:14,130
Wait, why me?

900
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,950
I didn't do anything.

901
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:19,050
I'm just a baby.

902
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:20,450
Doki's cool.

903
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,630
Music's getting very loud.

904
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:30,030
I don't have any music.

905
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:31,590
Doki alone.

906
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:33,550
Is that why there's music?

907
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,290
Is anybody being hunted right now?

908
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,750
Negative behavior.

909
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,410
No, baby, we see you.

910
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:54,630
No pee-pee.

911
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:56,150
No pee-pee.

912
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,150
Pee-pee in pants.

913
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,550
Pee-pee in pants.

914
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,050
Hey, hey, hey.

915
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,450
Go, go, go, go.

916
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,190
Nothing to be afraid of.

917
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,710
We're not cheating.

918
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:09,370
I do not.

919
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,410
I cannot shoot anymore.

920
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,070
Okay, okay.

921
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,670
Okay, okay.

922
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:23,710
Okay.

923
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:29,790
Do not.

924
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:32,950
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

925
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:37,030
Oh, I messed up the series.

926
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:37,890
I messed up the series.

927
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,810
I'm not in the group.

928
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:40,050
I'm not in the group.

929
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,330
I messed up the series.

930
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,190
Everybody conga.

931
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,390
Come and do the conga.

932
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,030
Everybody conga.

933
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,010
Spam, spam, spam, spam.

934
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,670
Guys, how do we get intel if everybody's getting it?

935
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,870
Okay, this is not intel.

936
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:00,570
This is just a school trip that you can't get off of.

937
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:01,910
You can't get out.

938
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:03,230
This is worse.

939
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,750
This is worse.

940
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,110
It's like a mandatory school trip.

941
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:18,450
Karma.

942
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,530
I sure hope the next one is a safe dog.

943
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:24,670
Karma.

944
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,230
I sure hope it's a safe dog.

945
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:29,870
That's what you get.

946
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:31,650
Karma.

947
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,190
Karma.

948
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,090
Karma.

949
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,450
He actually got karma.

950
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,090
Yes, he got it.

951
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,430
I'm going to throw up.

952
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,490
I'm going to throw up.

953
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:46,190
I hate this.

954
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,570
He actually got karma.

955
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,790
That's so funny.

956
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,150
I hate this.

957
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:16,950
This is it.

958
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,330
I'm after A.

959
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:22,970
It doesn't matter anyway, guys.

960
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,190
No, what am I saying?

961
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,210
It doesn't matter.

962
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:26,930
It's majority.

963
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,370
I feel like when people pick safe dogs, they should be safe.

964
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:38,070
I feel like if you pick safe dog, you should automatically be safe.

965
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:41,270
Papo, you went alone last time.

966
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:47,270
You should not be forced to do this.

967
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:51,810
We should not be forced.

968
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:06,050
If you have a safe dog, you shouldn't be forced to do this again.

969
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,670
People are coming.

970
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:10,950
I feel like he might be revived.

971
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,050
Is he coming?

972
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,890
This is the illusion of choice.

973
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,390
I can't take this.

974
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:27,390
We all lose.

975
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,970
I feel like he is camping the dog.

976
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:38,610
It's a guy that wanted to be my wife.

977
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:50,050
Six more to go.

978
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:54,630
Six more to go.

979
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:02,850
It's time for God lost his male wife.

980
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:08,130
It doesn't matter where we are.

981
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,530
They randomly put us.

982
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,390
They randomly group us out.

983
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:14,250
It doesn't matter where we are.

984
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:20,310
It doesn't matter where you get grouped up into.

985
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,470
It's random.

986
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:23,710
It was invisible.

987
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,670
It was invisible, chief.

988
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,230
I swear, it was actually not there.

989
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,690
I'm next to this door.

990
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,410
It doesn't matter.

991
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:53,930
We all get caught.

992
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,930
Not even on that, but we all get caught.

993
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,500
No, that doesn't exist.

994
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,760
We know the route.

995
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,020
We know the route, guys.

996
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,560
We know the route.

997
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,060
I'm in the middle.

998
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,480
Because I don't contribute.

999
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,580
I'm a leech.

1000
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,220
I'm just here to leech.

1001
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,100
I'm good, I'm good.

1002
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,360
I'm safe, no worries.

1003
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,460
Dukie rat tactics.

1004
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:49,740
We're going for the drone.

1005
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,040
Of course.

1006
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,040
They're running, they're running.

1007
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,620
They're coming to me.

1008
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,320
Are they around here?

1009
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,240
I don't know.

1010
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,060
Run, run.

1011
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:06,920
They're running.

1012
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,100
We're running for nothing, bro.

1013
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:09,940
I think we're running for nothing.

1014
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:11,820
Wait, wait, wait.

1015
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,840
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1016
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,680
Stop it, guys.

1017
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,480
Stop it, stop it.

1018
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,240
Stop it.

1019
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,180
Stop it.

1020
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:21,980
Stop it.

1021
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,920
Stop it.

1022
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,700
Hold the corner.

1023
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,780
Corner, corner, corner.

1024
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,660
We're in such a grief, bro.

1025
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,560
Do you guys see anything?

1026
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:36,740
Yeah.

1027
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,400
Dukie.

1028
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,360
Dukie, Dukie...

1029
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,660
It's safe, it's safe, it's safe.

1030
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,340
There's my mother.

1031
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,860
The kid in the supermarket...

1032
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,400
The kid in the supermarket...

1033
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,900
I can't stay...

1034
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,300
There's a kid in the supermarket...

1035
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:02,600
Where's my mom?

1036
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,340
Where's my mom?

1037
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,580
Get up, get up, get up.

1038
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,380
Sam's balls are on the ground, dude.

1039
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:16,180
Bro, I thought game day 2 was bad.

1040
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,380
I don't know, this is worse.

1041
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:21,700
This is actually much worse than day 2.

1042
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,160
This is worse.

1043
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,540
And I have to listen to the voices.

1044
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:39,140
I need an adult.

1045
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,560
I need an adult, guys.

1046
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,100
The voices.

1047
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,980
The audio is louder.

1048
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,020
They're running, they're running.

1049
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,500
They're running, they're running, they're running.

1050
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,400
They're running, they're running, they're running.

1051
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,380
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1052
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,140
This could be a tie.

1053
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,380
Watch out for being pinched.

1054
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,140
Watch in front of you.

1055
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,740
Following Sam, following Sam.

1056
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,960
Everyone go the same way.

1057
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,360
Don't split, don't split, don't split.

1058
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,020
Stay in a group.

1059
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:09,560
Don't split, guys, don't split.

1060
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,240
Behind you, behind you, behind you.

1061
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,800
Let's go to the center, let's go to the center.

1062
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,820
I am Cormie.

1063
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,420
I am Cormie.

1064
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:47,960
I am Cormie.

1065
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,040
Who is Cormie?

1066
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,320
It says Cormie.

1067
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:50,560
Cormie.

1068
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:54,120
I am Cormie, guys.

1069
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,420
He was actually Cormie!

1070
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,580
He was actually Cormie!

1071
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,600
It was very close.

1072
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,040
It's okay, it's okay.

1073
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:06,960
I am Cormie.

1074
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,440
Okay, in the corner, corner, corner.

1075
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,400
In the center, in the center.

1076
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,080
I apologize a million times.

1077
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,320
I'm sorry, Miss Jackson.

1078
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,580
Twitch Sims is back!

1079
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,300
Twitch Sims is back!

1080
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,260
Enough,

1081
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,400
enough, enough.

1082
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:56,960
Potras!

1083
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:57,760
Potras!

1084
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,100
Potras!

1085
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:58,440
Potras!

1086
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,640
Let's troll...

1087
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,020
Lime, lime, lime, lime, lime!

1088
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,280
Both lime, both lime, both lime.

1089
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,180
Both lime, lime, lime.

1090
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,060
Both lime, lime, lime, lime.

1091
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,020
Quindo, quiet, quiet.

1092
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,340
Listen to me, listen to me.

1093
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,620
I'm so...

1094
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:36,840
I'm so...

1095
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,280
Lime, lime, lime, lime.

1096
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,840
Green is life, green is life.

1097
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,560
Green and then black.

1098
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,460
Green, what's your problem?

1099
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,660
What does green do?

1100
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,800
What's green's power?

1101
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,340
Each doll has a different ability.

1102
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,900
These dolls are faster, these dolls are faster.

1103
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,560
No, no, no, no.

1104
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,660
Yay.

1105
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,220
Yay.

1106
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,500
I'm skeptical, I'm skeptical, I'm skeptical.

1107
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,540
I don't know what that even means for us.

1108
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:25,780
It's not good because it doesn't matter if we're safe!

1109
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,500
It's even doesn't matter where!

1110
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,580
It doesn't matter!

1111
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,860
We're not actually safe!

1112
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,480
I'm so scared!

1113
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,700
What's the point?

1114
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,800
10 people have to die anyways, right?

1115
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:55,180
I'm just making this round longer!

1116
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:59,840
Yeah, regenerate.

1117
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,120
Oh, please!

1118
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,340
We already had three dolls left!

1119
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,280
Okay, we obviously know what a good doll looks like.

1120
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,900
Light blue, light blue, light blue.

1121
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,740
Light blue, light blue, light blue, light blue.

1122
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,420
No, no, she's bad, she's bad, she's bad.

1123
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,920
Oh, this bet is going to shake.

1124
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,760
I've been here before, my sanity drops.

1125
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,880
Oh, this is supposed to be the less stressful one, too!

1126
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,580
This is supposed to be the less stressful one.

1127
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,200
What's the point of this?

1128
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,280
Good question!

1129
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,520
What is the point of the safe doll?

1130
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,720
Very good question!

1131
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,080
Nobody knows!

1132
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:09,180
Nobody knows what's the point of the safe doll.

1133
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,060
Nobody knows!

1134
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,280
Stay in the safe zone.

1135
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:19,400
Oh, they can shoot you?

1136
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,540
Stay here, stay here.

1137
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,860
We've been chilling here, we've been chilling.

1138
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,280
We've been chilling, we've been chilling.

1139
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,660
Oh, my God!

1140
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,580
I like how the strategists follow the Spanish players.

1141
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,260
They know what they're doing.

1142
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,520
They know exactly what they're doing.

1143
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:52,140
Oh, my God.

1144
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,480
$70,000 for that in America?

1145
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,940
That's a lot of money converted for them.

1146
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:57,720
There!

1147
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,880
That's when you know they really want to win, guys.

1148
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,800
It's not going to lie.

1149
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,400
$70,000, it's like you're set.

1150
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,120
There's definitely two of these ones.

1151
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,040
These guys are running here, they're running right now.

1152
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,980
They're running, they're running.

1153
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,900
Me too, because it's 100k Canadian.

1154
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:23,900
Me too!

1155
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,720
Me too, because it's like 100k Canadian.

1156
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,020
I'm behind every middle, I'm behind every middle.

1157
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,100
I don't feel safe, bro!

1158
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:38,780
That's so loud!

1159
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,460
That's so loud!

1160
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,700
There was like explosions.

1161
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,460
Oh, my God.

1162
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,080
Oh, my God!

1163
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,400
Oh, my God!

1164
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,260
Oh, my God!

1165
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,080
Oh, my God!

1166
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,020
He did it!

1167
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,560
Yes!

1168
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,820
He did it!

1169
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:28,560
What?

1170
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,090
What?

1171
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,480
Hold your breath!

1172
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,600
What?

1173
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,280
What?

1174
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,400
I was

1175
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,130
1HP!

1176
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:55,750
I was 1HP!

1177
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,290
Come here, I was 1HP!

1178
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:58,910
Hey!

1179
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,650
I was 1HP!

1180
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,550
I would've been out!

1181
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:10,210
Are you like... are you like dissociated from all the noise?

1182
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,230
Gumi is so done.

1183
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,750
Gumi is so done.

1184
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:21,990
Honestly, same.

1185
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:29,930
It's magenta!

1186
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:41,150
Five more.

1187
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,650
Five more!

1188
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,870
I'll be okay if I get a win here.

1189
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:50,930
I actually... I can.

1190
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:51,510
I can.

1191
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:52,330
I'm so tired.

1192
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:55,490
I'm so goddamn tired, guys.

1193
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,150
I'm so tired.

1194
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:59,330
I'm so tired.

1195
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,530
I'm so tired.

1196
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:09,030
Is there one behind us?

1197
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,010
I haven't seen him.

1198
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:18,930
That was fast!

1199
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:20,350
That was so fast!

1200
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:21,030
That was so fast.

1201
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,030
Oh my god, you're a lot faster now.

1202
01:19:23,370 --> 01:19:24,930
Oh my god, we're dying.

1203
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:29,510
Well, now the superior red man to the left has gotten rid of the competition.

1204
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:38,790
Guys, guys, if he's gonna hit you, just hit the spots.

1205
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:39,470
The hidden spots.

1206
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:40,730
If he's gonna hit you, just thug it out.

1207
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:41,730
Just ignore him.

1208
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,130
Don't, don't, don't.

1209
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:43,930
Hit the thug shake.

1210
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:44,470
Thug shake.

1211
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:47,050
Shake?

1212
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,010
I'm gonna shake you, Gumi.

1213
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:55,610
I got that one.

1214
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:03,290
You're happy in your nightclub, you're head's so sunny.

1215
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,170
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

1216
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:10,270
If you're happy and you know it, everyone's jealous.

1217
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:13,730
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

1218
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:19,010
During my pride, how dare you?

1219
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,370
During my pride?

1220
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:27,440
This is a social experiment.

1221
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,420
This is a Stanford Prison experiment.

1222
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,340
I refuse to believe this is a tournament anymore.

1223
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,440
This is a psychology experiment.

1224
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:43,620
On the declining mental capacity of a typical extremer.

1225
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,300
I refuse to believe...

1226
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:49,980
He's coming for us.

1227
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:53,980
He's coming for us.

1228
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,620
But they're all faster than me.

1229
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,240
Oh, I'm so upset.

1230
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:01,840
I'm so nervous.

1231
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,960
These guys are all good Minecraft players.

1232
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,420
He's so loud.

1233
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,480
He's so loud.

1234
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:14,800
He's so loud.

1235
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:17,540
They're all better players than me.

1236
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,240
No, I'm so nervous.

1237
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,260
They're all so much better players than me.

1238
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,420
I'm so upset.

1239
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,240
Run, run, run.

1240
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,300
No, get out.

1241
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,260
Don't let them get out.

1242
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,360
No, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

1243
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,520
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

1244
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,680
They're all faster than me.

1245
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:35,820
Help.

1246
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,300
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

1247
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,740
He's here, he's here.

1248
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,220
He's still there, he's still there.

1249
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,120
No, I messed up the stairs, I messed up the stairs, guys, I messed up the stairs.

1250
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,540
No, not safe, not safe, not safe.

1251
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,180
He's right there.

1252
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,920
Axe or no?

1253
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,460
Axe or no?

1254
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,580
Axe or no?

1255
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:07,300
He's still behind, he's still behind, he's still behind.

1256
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,240
He's still right behind.

1257
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,180
I don't like him.

1258
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:16,420
I don't like him.

1259
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,500
You live with my dream, stay with me.

1260
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,880
Relocate my fantasy.

1261
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,720
I stay reality.

1262
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,940
You live with my dream, stay with me.

1263
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,640
See you in this fucking galaxy.

1264
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,660
Oh, what the fuck?

1265
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,580
Run, run, run, run, run.

1266
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,560
It's on us, it's on us, it's on us, it's on us.

1267
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,180
It's right there, it's right there, it's right there.

1268
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,500
It's right there, it's right there, it's right there.

1269
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,540
I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared.

1270
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:47,540
Oh my god.

1271
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,480
Oh my god, oh my god.

1272
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,580
Oh please, just kill somebody.

1273
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,840
This mental torture.

1274
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,500
This mental torture.

1275
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:13,240
Oh my god, this mental torture.

1276
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:18,920
Just give us money for this, I don't care.

1277
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,400
We deserve money for doing this.

1278
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,960
The sick entertainment for viewers.

1279
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,860
We deserve money for this.

1280
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,900
Oh my god.

1281
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,160
Oh my god, please.

1282
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,940
This is so sad.

1283
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,520
We deserve to be rewarded by Twitch for this.

1284
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,660
Not you guys, not you guys.

1285
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:03,980
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

1286
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,200
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

1287
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:09,800
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

1288
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,960
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

1289
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,520
We deserve $70,000.

1290
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,620
Nice, nice.

1291
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,200
Oh my god.

1292
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,320
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

1293
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:36,420
Oh my god.

1294
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:45,340
We can't mute guys, we have to listen to Noah and we have to run.

1295
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,400
That's the worst part.

1296
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:49,580
We have to run.

1297
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,600
I'll try and turn it down again.

1298
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,820
Dude, this game is lasting way too much.

1299
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,300
How many people need to die?

1300
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:13,620
I don't know.

1301
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:14,680
Three?

1302
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,240
Three more.

1303
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,380
Goodbye,

1304
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:21,800
this is it.

1305
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,340
I can feel it, this has to be it, this has to be it.

1306
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,800
Please, please just kill me.

1307
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,400
Just take me out.

1308
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,940
Please, just like instantly run at me.

1309
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:32,680
I don't care.

1310
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,440
Just instantly run at me.

1311
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,460
Is it coming?

1312
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:36,920
Is it coming?

1313
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,840
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop.

1314
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,580
Don't stop.

1315
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,160
Believe in me.

1316
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,340
Hold on to my feelings.

1317
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:52,220
You were so close.

1318
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,520
It was literally right here.

1319
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,100
Was it right here?

1320
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,360
Yeah, this one is really bad.

1321
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,340
We should stop this one.

1322
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,460
We should just stop taking this one.

1323
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,180
I think we have to go for every single one of them now.

1324
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,680
The other guy, Axel, is my friend.

1325
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,840
Why are you guys not coming to me?

1326
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,820
Why are you guys not coming to me?

1327
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,900
No, leave me alone.

1328
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:27,540
Leave me alone, leave me alone.

1329
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,540
Leave me alone.

1330
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:32,920
Yeah, brown neck.

1331
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,200
Leave, leave.

1332
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,900
Don't come near me.

1333
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:47,800
Yeah, I don't know.

1334
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,480
Alright, this is where I die.

1335
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,120
Just run at me.

1336
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,620
Stab me, that's all I want.

1337
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,100
Just stab me.

1338
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,500
Put me out of my misery.

1339
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,360
Just stab me.

1340
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:05,820
I'm being hunted.

1341
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,580
Is he coming?

1342
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:07,740
Yes.

1343
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:08,600
No.

1344
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:09,700
Is it a question mark?

1345
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,980
I don't think any of them followed.

1346
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:11,760
I saw it.

1347
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1348
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,080
One followed once.

1349
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,060
Oh my god, I thought it was going to be hunting me.

1350
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,180
I thought it was it.

1351
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:18,880
I don't know.

1352
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:19,500
I don't think so.

1353
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,620
We shouldn't run, we shouldn't run.

1354
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,240
We should stay in the corner, guys.

1355
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,440
Is it behind us?

1356
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,940
I don't know, but it's somewhere.

1357
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:24,860
It's not behind us.

1358
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,160
Why would we move from a place that's...

1359
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,600
Sylvie, Sylvie, come, come, come.

1360
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,140
Sylvie, come, come, come.

1361
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:35,980
Sylvie, my friend, right in the corner.

1362
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:37,760
I don't trust that spot, guys.

1363
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,120
Watch that side, I'm going to watch that side.

1364
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:41,160
I mean, I got it.

1365
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,620
It's hunting you from over here, so...

1366
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:44,500
This is so sad.

1367
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,800
I got one earlier, that's why I wanted to go...

1368
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,720
The groups are shrinking, man.

1369
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:50,820
Oh, there's a group coming over here.

1370
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,640
Oh, there's a group coming.

1371
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,140
Question, question, question.

1372
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:54,900
He's running from the other end.

1373
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,260
Oh yeah, it's right here, it's right here.

1374
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,460
It's right in front of me, it's right in front of me.

1375
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,460
There's one here as well, there's one here as well.

1376
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,580
They turned around, they turned around.

1377
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,160
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.

1378
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,980
Stay near the other crab, stay near the other crab, stay near the other crab.

1379
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,480
Remember guys, just don't die and everything will be fine.

1380
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:21,640
Wolfie, just stay back there, you're good.

1381
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,620
Oh, he is behind us, wow.

1382
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,900
He hit my butt.

1383
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:26,820
He's right behind me, isn't he?

1384
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:31,040
Oh no, this is it, this is it guys, this is it.

1385
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,060
I'm the slowest.

1386
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,920
I don't know the tech, I don't know the tech.

1387
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,520
Goodbye.

1388
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,120
Goodbye.

1389
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,820
Goodbye guys.

1390
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,300
I don't know the running tech.

1391
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,700
It is right behind us, it is right behind us.

1392
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,680
I don't know.

1393
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,880
I don't know the running tech, this is it.

1394
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,020
Oh, got me one too.

1395
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,120
Gooby, gooby, run.

1396
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,300
We had a good run.

1397
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,940
We had such a good run, everybody.

1398
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,340
We had such a good run, everyone.

1399
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:12,860
We had an insane run, everybody, but this is it.

1400
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,000
This is it.

1401
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,160
You got me there.

1402
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:21,720
No, no.

1403
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1404
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,040
Yeah, nevermind, it's still there.

1405
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,040
Throw in fireballs, throw in fireballs.

1406
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,720
Oh my god.

1407
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:36,240
I just want somebody to turn around and just take it.

1408
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:43,920
This is not even like hide anymore, it's just run.

1409
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,440
It's not even hide and seek.

1410
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,820
It's like a marathon run.

1411
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,560
We're just doing a marathon right now.

1412
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:00,660
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

1413
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:01,220
Convergence.

1414
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,520
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

1415
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,440
Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.

1416
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,340
Oh my god.

1417
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,560
It's a goddamn marathon.

1418
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,500
Turn around, turn around.

1419
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:10,440
I'm scared.

1420
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,620
Every now and then I fall apart.

1421
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,440
And I cannot be alive.

1422
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:16,920
And I cannot be alive.

1423
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:24,140
It just killed like three people, honestly.

1424
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:24,900
This is not good.

1425
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,700
We gotta converge with those guys.

1426
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,400
I screwed up.

1427
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,040
Oh, here it is.

1428
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,520
The sacrifice.

1429
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,740
Goodbye, funny guy 312.

1430
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,360
This is it.

1431
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,160
It would be so poetic that I got eliminated last person.

1432
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,300
As the last person, I get eliminated right away.

1433
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,800
It'd be so poetic though.

1434
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,080
Oh my god.

1435
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:54,360
After going through the entire round, the stressful day, I am the last person to be out.

1436
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,840
It would be so poetic.

1437
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,720
It would be so poetic.

1438
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,900
Guys, green is not gonna happen.

1439
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,020
Green is not gonna happen.

1440
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:16,400
I'm gonna be honest.

1441
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:22,740
Why does it have to be green?

1442
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,320
Why does it have to be safe?

1443
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:25,900
Why?

1444
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:35,380
I don't care.

1445
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,520
I'm just not there.

1446
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,680
No matter what, I'm just not there.

1447
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:49,160
No matter what happens, I just don't wanna be there.

1448
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:51,560
Flex.

1449
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:53,780
This is the good one.

1450
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,100
And that's it?

1451
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:57,440
It's over?

1452
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,300
No, and then we go for the bad one.

1453
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,620
It doesn't make sense how good it is.

1454
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:03,740
Yeah.

1455
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:04,820
It's a challenge.

1456
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:05,680
This is not a challenge.

1457
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,280
Flex, did you notice the color?

1458
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:10,660
The color you chose.

1459
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,220
Oh my god.

1460
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,580
Don't be safe.

1461
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,280
Why does he keep screaming?

1462
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,420
Who is this?

1463
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,200
Call the streamer out right now.

1464
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,020
Who is this?

1465
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:26,860
And I will specifically meet that person in voice chat if I live.

1466
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:29,840
Is it?

1467
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,920
Oh my god.

1468
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,620
Okay, I have power.

1469
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,680
Okay, well, there's just one dog left.

1470
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:42,940
Okay.

1471
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,820
What's the point of safe dogs, bro?

1472
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,580
Where is he?

1473
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,660
Oh wait, I got the wrong one.

1474
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,940
Whoops, sorry.

1475
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,700
It's meaningless.

1476
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,840
We're all meant to die anyway.

1477
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,280
Red guys don't die.

1478
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,340
Red guys don't die.

1479
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:03,180
Red guys don't die.

1480
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,160
Red guys don't die.

1481
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,400
Red guys don't die.

1482
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:07,320
I'm sorry.

1483
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,860
Oh my god, thank you for the tier one.

1484
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,160
I'm going through hell right now.

1485
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,780
This is it.

1486
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:16,720
Goodbye.

1487
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,780
Everybody, it was a good run.

1488
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,520
It was a good run, everyone.

1489
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,320
I had a...

1490
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,520
It was a good run.

1491
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,760
I had a great time being here with everybody.

1492
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,860
It was such a good run that like...

1493
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,600
We had such a good run.

1494
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,080
It was such a good run and this is where we...

1495
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,880
This is where we call it.

1496
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:53,400
Guys, if it says that it's targeting you, you have to jump inside one of those hiding places.

1497
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,180
If you don't do it, it's going to kill you.

1498
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,420
I was targeted last time.

1499
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,980
I was targeted last time.

1500
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,620
That's insane.

1501
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,000
GG!

1502
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:05,440
No way!

1503
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:06,860
He lost.

1504
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:07,760
He died.

1505
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:15,580
No...

1506
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:23,220
No...

1507
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,820
I mean, are we the last like six from our room, guys?

1508
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:26,960
Oh my god!

1509
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,060
Wait, is that how it works?

1510
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:28,520
What the hell?

1511
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:29,280
I think so.

1512
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,940
I think we all have like a set spawn room in like a restaurant.

1513
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,560
It'll just be a couple...

1514
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,400
This is the pain that never ends.

1515
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:47,100
I think this one was the worst one.

1516
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,000
One more game.

1517
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,620
30 people.

1518
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:56,260
30 people are going to get eliminated in the next one.

1519
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,980
It's the prop hunt game.

1520
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:01,180
The...

1521
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,880
Wait, you all got eliminated?

1522
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,120
Oh my god!

1523
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,060
Too fair.

1524
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,180
I was surprised he lived this long.

1525
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:11,720
Oh my god!

1526
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,520
I was just so stressed.

1527
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,360
Oh my god.

1528
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,640
I need to be in a corner.

1529
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:18,100
I need to...

1530
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:18,340
Wait.

1531
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:19,420
Okay, that's cool.

1532
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,320
Give me a sec, guys.

1533
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:34,880
Oh my god.

1534
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,840
Let me turn down the...

1535
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:38,880
Wait, voice chat would be...

1536
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,100
Okay, give me a sec.

1537
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,840
I actually need to reset myself.

1538
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:49,320
Oh my god.

1539
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,120
I feel like they should have play tested that game.

1540
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,020
Devlin, thank you for the 100 bitties.

1541
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,200
Thank you, thank you.

1542
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,060
I'm so sorry for the voices, guys.

1543
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,500
I couldn't take my meds, guys.

1544
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,120
We needed intel.

1545
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,460
I'm so...

1546
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:16,160
I'm so sorry for the screaming earlier.

1547
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,080
Bro, I'm so tired.

1548
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:26,060
That one game exhausted me.

1549
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,320
Oh my god.

1550
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:32,780
That one fucking game actually exhausted me.

1551
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,900
I actually had to mute somebody.

1552
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,360
I was like, no, bro.

1553
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:42,100
If this is a Stanford prison experiment, bro, I'm fucking...

1554
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:42,960
Let me out.

1555
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,840
Let me out of that prison.

1556
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,640
The voices were so strong.

1557
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,780
Oh my god.

1558
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,720
All that for 10 people to be eliminated.

1559
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,540
That's the worst part.

1560
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:03,300
Only 10 people were eliminated.

1561
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,820
At least the experiment subjects got paid.

1562
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:09,180
Bro, I should get paid.

1563
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:15,900
I should get paid for like the mental toll that took out of me.

1564
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,740
It was good content.

1565
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:20,440
Yeah, the next game is 30.

1566
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:23,500
Bro, those puppets should have killed 20 people.

1567
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,260
I don't understand.

1568
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,260
They should have gotten a goddamn double kill.

1569
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:33,140
Instead, they put us through hell.

1570
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:37,820
They put us through hell for this sick entertainment.

1571
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:42,360
Bro, it's just a game.

1572
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,840
Oh my god.

1573
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,880
It might be just a game.

1574
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:55,000
I felt like I just aged another 50 years playing this game.

1575
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:00,100
Nobody gets paid until day 5.

1576
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,160
The content of winning.

1577
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,700
I was actually going crazy.

1578
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,840
I was going goddamn crazy.

1579
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,280
I thought I was gonna turn into Joker.

1580
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,860
I thought I was gonna turn into Joker right there.

1581
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,700
Oh my god.

1582
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,800
Oh, but it's over.

1583
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:26,860
Day 10.

1584
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:27,780
Game 2.

1585
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:28,860
Prop hunt.

1586
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:35,220
I'm gonna die so fast as a prop, guys.

1587
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,180
Knowing my luck, I'm gonna get prop.

1588
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:43,540
I'm gonna get like instant fucking ganked by a hunter.

1589
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,440
Jokeybird is coming back.

1590
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:47,480
I had to mute.

1591
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:48,100
I can't.

1592
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,800
I can't.

1593
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,640
I can't listen to the voices anymore.

1594
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,780
I can't.

1595
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:54,540
Guys.

1596
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,540
Are they looking at a funeral for their friend?

1597
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,440
Oh, they are.

1598
01:38:59,440 --> 01:38:59,520
Okay.

1599
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:04,700
We're gonna have a vlog.

1600
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:05,620
I'm gonna let you know what's inside.

1601
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,240
Holy shit.

1602
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:26,450
Oh my god.

1603
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,210
Oh my god.

1604
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:31,550
What the fuck?

1605
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,790
Okay, I don't think they're friends.

1606
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:42,710
Guys, I don't think that was a friend, guys.

1607
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:47,450
That was definitely not a poor friend.

1608
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:49,430
Hello.

1609
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:52,990
I'm here.

1610
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:54,830
I'm here.

1611
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:56,850
Yeah.

1612
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:59,250
I made it.

1613
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:02,090
Yeah.

1614
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:03,950
I was hunted.

1615
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:08,070
It's okay.

1616
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:09,030
You didn't die.

1617
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:10,430
All my other friends died.

1618
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:16,330
This is hell, Gumi.

1619
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,170
That last game was hell.

1620
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:22,870
I don't know if you're gonna like the next game anymore.

1621
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,250
I think the next game is harder.

1622
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:25,410
Yeah.

1623
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:28,230
Gumi was a good run, Gumi.

1624
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:31,970
Get to day 4 for me, Gumi.

1625
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,030
I believe in you.

1626
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:37,650
I believe in you, Gumi.

1627
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:39,510
Live on for me.

1628
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,570
Live on.

1629
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:49,630
If you're a hunter and I'm a prop, I'll give you that one point, Gumi.

1630
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,730
I don't know how to find you.

1631
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:54,250
You'll know it's me.

1632
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:59,370
You go into a room and you see a prop moving.

1633
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:00,990
That's me.

1634
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:03,550
You take that one point.

1635
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:07,970
You take that one point and take it over the day 4, Gumi.

1636
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:12,470
I don't know how it's gonna be like.

1637
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:15,470
It's basically a... It's like a...

1638
01:41:16,190 --> 01:41:17,410
One for all.

1639
01:41:17,570 --> 01:41:18,430
That's what you said.

1640
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:20,070
Maybe.

1641
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:20,810
I don't know.

1642
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:21,790
It can't be team.

1643
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:25,530
Abe died because his game crashed.

1644
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:26,490
Wait, really?

1645
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:28,190
That's why he died?

1646
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:29,250
You know what's funny?

1647
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:34,430
Abe was like, we should sacrifice Doki to the monster.

1648
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,970
And then he died like 10 seconds later.

1649
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:55,660
I'll be honest, I was so ready to sacrifice any random that I saw.

1650
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,420
I was like, nothing's chasing us.

1651
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:00,700
Bro, I just wanted it to be over.

1652
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,960
That shit was so stressful.

1653
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,480
Did you F5?

1654
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,860
No, I didn't.

1655
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,060
I just followed the crowd.

1656
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,920
The safe zones didn't matter.

1657
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,940
I didn't understand the safe zones.

1658
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:14,100
It didn't matter.

1659
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:16,520
It was just until we got rid of all the dolls.

1660
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,740
The safe zones actually did nothing.

1661
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:20,740
Yeah, it did nothing.

1662
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,700
It just prolonged the game.

1663
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,160
Yeah, and we had to choose all the dolls anyway, so what's the point?

1664
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,320
Yeah, and then there's always majority.

1665
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:31,640
Majority wins.

1666
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,620
So it doesn't matter what we choose.

1667
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:35,480
Illusion, I chose Illusion.

1668
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:40,440
Yeah, and then one guy was screaming at the top of his... I muted that guy.

1669
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,600
Who is it?

1670
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:43,180
Tell me who is it.

1671
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:44,100
Oh, you're going to mute him too?

1672
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,620
Yeah, it's the sap guy.

1673
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:50,820
I know who you're talking about.

1674
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,320
Yeah, I muted him.

1675
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,260
I was like, chat, tell me who it is.

1676
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:55,840
I can't.

1677
01:42:56,140 --> 01:43:00,200
I cannot hear him yell at everybody anymore.

1678
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:01,300
I can't.

1679
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:08,580
Oh no, yeah, I kept muting until you got mid-round just to hear if someone's coming or not.

1680
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:13,040
Yeah, I kept it on the entire time because I was so scared.

1681
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,680
I was so scared that I was going to die.

1682
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:18,480
No, I was kind of getting pissed off.

1683
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,540
Oh no, I was just crying.

1684
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:24,500
I feel like loud does not equal funny, so I was just getting...

1685
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,780
Yeah, it was just not funny.

1686
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,940
Like, unless you say something funny, but they weren't saying anything funny.

1687
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:35,080
It's the person I lied to on day one.

1688
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:35,780
I feel bad.

1689
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:36,600
Rest in peace.

1690
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:37,420
I don't.

1691
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:45,000
I learned that from the Spanish people.

1692
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,460
I unmuted and they were spitting at somebody's grave.

1693
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:55,750
Yeah, I was like, oh look, they're paying respect to their dead friend.

1694
01:43:55,870 --> 01:44:00,330
And then I muted and it was just a group of people like spitting on his grave.

1695
01:44:00,450 --> 01:44:01,910
I was like, oh, I don't think that's a friend.

1696
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,870
Yeah, I'm watering the grass a little bit.

1697
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:12,190
A VTuber lived longer than you.

1698
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:20,750
Oh shit, we're on the main channel.

1699
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,430
I'm so sorry.

1700
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,290
I'm sorry, Eva.

1701
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:25,130
I'm so sorry.

1702
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:30,950
Okay, are we off yet?

1703
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,310
She's watering the flowers, man.

1704
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:39,570
We're watering the flowers.

1705
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:43,350
Who's next?

1706
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:46,530
Okay, that's not me, guys.

1707
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:47,450
That's not me.

1708
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:51,450
They heard all of it, Gooby.

1709
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:58,250
We're just paying respect by helping make sure the flowers... yeah.

1710
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:05,690
See, Mendo has no flowers.

1711
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:08,270
Yeah, because nobody paid respect to him.

1712
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:16,470
We're making sure that they're hydrated.

1713
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:19,150
Oh, this one I can't spit on.

1714
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:20,770
I'm going to throw it back on the floor.

1715
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:21,870
Okay, me too.

1716
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:23,590
I don't know who they are, but I will too.

1717
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:25,390
We're going to say our goodbyes to Red Velvet.

1718
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:26,950
I didn't mean to say goodbye to Gooby.

1719
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:28,670
I meant to say goodbye to Red Velvet.

1720
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,670
No, no, no, no, no.

1721
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,820
On Pride Month?

1722
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,960
I don't remember the rest.

1723
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,600
I don't know who this person is, but 07.

1724
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,240
Is this the guy that you were talking about?

1725
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:08,420
You don't like this guy?

1726
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,500
No, this guy didn't even follow me back on Twitter.

1727
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:11,840
Damn!

1728
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:12,900
Who is this guy?

1729
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,300
Wait, did he get out in this last game?

1730
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,840
No, yesterday.

1731
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:24,720
I was going to say, we had a run from the beast, but surely you'd think Sonic would be fast.

1732
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:25,820
Clearly not.

1733
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,620
No, they lost in the task one.

1734
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,700
The puzzle, quote-unquote.

1735
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:37,800
Damn, so he might be fast with his feet, but he's not fast with his brain.

1736
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:41,060
Oh my god, look, it's me!

1737
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:42,760
I see you!

1738
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,400
And dead bodies to the left and right of you.

1739
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,220
Yeah, all my friends are freaking dead.

1740
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,920
No, no, there's still Bear.

1741
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,120
Bear is still alive.

1742
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:52,060
Mr. Bear.

1743
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,500
Yeah, Wall-E is still alive.

1744
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,020
Where's your grave, Doki?

1745
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,300
Mine's all the way back here.

1746
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:57,540
Right at the beginning?

1747
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:58,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1748
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,640
Is it alphabetical?

1749
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,300
Yes.

1750
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,040
Yeah, yeah, so I get the front.

1751
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,280
Shay, wanna hear something funny?

1752
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:05,960
Yeah.

1753
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,260
Doki hard muted self now.

1754
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,160
That's funny.

1755
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,260
I think it's so funny.

1756
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,800
I mean, I don't blame you.

1757
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,600
He was screaming, I was like, I clearly can't focus.

1758
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,660
During the last game?

1759
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,260
Yeah.

1760
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,920
Oh, you muted him during the last game?

1761
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,940
No, no, yeah, during the last game I muted him.

1762
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,320
I was like, chat, who is this person that keeps yelling?

1763
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,220
And everybody just said, that guy.

1764
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:32,340
So, that might have been my fault, because I had a strategy, and he was like right next to me.

1765
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,260
And I knew people would listen to him, because he just screams.

1766
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:36,060
Hold on, rules are up.

1767
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:37,560
Yeah?

1768
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:37,880
What?

1769
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:38,540
Okay.

1770
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:39,400
Rules are up.

1771
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:39,920
Oh, okay.

1772
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,380
Eight people get selected.

1773
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:48,480
Oh, so you have to like, survive, and you get points, and you have to complete tasks, and you get points.

1774
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:52,120
Activate a locked door.

1775
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:52,720
Oh my, what are these?

1776
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,880
Oh, you respawn if you're a hunter as a prop.

1777
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,560
Bro, what the heck, this rules is like, an essay.

1778
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:01,880
I'll show a video, man, I'll show you a video.

1779
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:02,960
There's an essay.

1780
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:04,920
How to become monsters upon respawning.

1781
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:06,240
Monsters will still be monsters.

1782
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:10,920
Players will be able to select a monster class, which they will want to play next.

1783
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:11,400
What?

1784
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,380
That's what I'm saying, it's a goddamn essay.

1785
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:15,580
Maybe.

1786
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:24,040
So my best thing, I'd say, is obviously try to complete tasks, but I'd say try to get those survival points, because it might come down to just simple points.

1787
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:24,660
Yeah.

1788
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,980
Okay, wait, so like, what do you mean by it's your fault?

1789
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,160
What did you do?

1790
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:36,260
Oh, so basically the way that last game worked is whatever color got picked, that's where they would start spawning.

1791
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:41,120
So I wanted them to spawn on the opposite side, so we had as much time to run.

1792
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:47,460
And Sapnap was like the person to my right, so I was like, Sapnap, just get them all to pick the other side.

1793
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,880
You meant that it was you!

1794
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,940
It was you all along!

1795
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,200
I'm sorry!

1796
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:56,140
Alright, I'm sorry.

1797
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,780
I had to pay for my therapy for that game.

1798
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:02,780
My bad, my bad, my bad.

1799
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,940
Oh my god, it was him.

1800
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,480
He was the mastermind.

1801
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:12,700
As a hunter, you just get points for killing someone, but you don't want to hit the wrong people, because then you lose points.

1802
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:16,700
Alright, so this will be divided into two groups, props and hunters.

1803
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:17,960
And then it just leaves my points to get eliminated.

1804
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:22,780
Each participant will start as hunters, with the remaining... oh my god, there's so much reading!

1805
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:27,540
Each round, 8 participants start as hunters, while the remaining will start as props.

1806
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:30,520
A total of 4 rounds are played, and elimination will occur after all rounds have been played.

1807
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:32,820
Winners that start a round will be randomly selected.

1808
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:35,220
If a player dies, they will cool down before they may respawn.

1809
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:39,540
Props become monsters upon respawning, while monsters will still be monsters in both cases.

1810
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,560
Players will be able to select which they want to play next.

1811
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:44,820
Each group has specific game objectives they must achieve as...

1812
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,500
Oh my god!

1813
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:50,820
Bro, that's...

1814
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:52,200
Okay, props gameplay.

1815
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,540
As props, players must survive as much as possible.

1816
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,660
If props survive for at least 5 minutes during a set round, the player will earn points.

1817
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:01,900
Props can activate door locks to help running from the hunters, but there is a point penalty by each.

1818
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:03,920
Props will also be given 4 quests to complete.

1819
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,020
Upon completing a quest, the player can earn special items and will also earn points.

1820
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:13,060
Props can solidify on other objects by pressing F at a position they would like.

1821
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,820
They can also ship-ship each other objects by clicking at them.

1822
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:22,340
Prop disguise includes, but are not limited to, skulls, kettle, holders, pots, statues, chairs, etc.

1823
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:29,560
An anti-AFK system is applied to the game, making props visible to everyone if they stay in the same position for 60 seconds.

1824
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:34,600
The AFK debuff will be removed once the player moves at least 4 blocks away from the position.

1825
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:36,920
If a prop is defeated by a hunter...

1826
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,240
There's more?!

1827
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:43,140
Okay guys, there's like an elimination paragraph as well.

1828
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:54,920
As hunters, players must select 1 out of 3 available hunting classes, each possessing different abilities.

1829
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:58,020
These can be used every few minutes to give them some advantage.

1830
01:50:58,020 --> 01:50:59,900
These can be selected at the start of each round.

1831
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,480
And also, hunters must defeat as many props as possible.

1832
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:03,760
Defeating a prop will give you a point.

1833
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,520
Hunters must pay close attention before striking objects.

1834
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:09,400
Once hitting a regular will have deals they will die.

1835
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,700
If you participate, all rounds are governed.

1836
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,500
Survive 5 minutes, plus 2 points.

1837
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,380
Survive 10 minutes, plus 2 points.

1838
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:17,700
Complete a task, plus 5.

1839
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,340
Defeat a prop, plus 5 points.

1840
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,260
Incorrect prop hit, minus 2.

1841
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:29,000
I read a lot of that.

1842
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:34,080
Alright guys, we gotta be in emote-only mode.

1843
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:35,280
Mud, put us on.

1844
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,900
Emote-only mode.

1845
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:39,260
I finished reading 2.

1846
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,080
That was like 3 goddamn pages.

1847
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:43,060
That was like a goddamn essay.

1848
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:48,180
Good luck guys.

1849
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,960
I hope you make it to day 4, Gumi.

1850
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:52,440
Rest in peace, Gun Teddy.

1851
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,780
Rest in peace.

1852
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,640
Rest in peace, funny guy.

1853
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:00,520
I'll never know actually how funny you were.

1854
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:02,440
Huh?

1855
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:03,880
You said something, I was peeing.

1856
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:07,980
Gumi, I believe in you.

1857
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:08,920
Make it to day 4.

1858
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:09,740
Do it for me.

1859
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:10,780
Do it for everybody.

1860
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,000
Do it for our fans.

1861
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:17,060
Okay, just try to do more tasks than surviving.

1862
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:17,640
Okay.

1863
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,100
I think it's good to come down to points.

1864
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:20,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1865
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,220
I'll try my best.

1866
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:22,840
I'll try my best.

1867
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,400
This will be the last time we can talk.

1868
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:25,280
Oh.

1869
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:26,320
Okay, nevermind.

1870
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:27,500
Nevermind.

1871
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,420
We can still talk.

1872
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,160
Oh yeah, did you put emote-only mode?

1873
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,560
Yeah, I'm about to.

1874
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,300
Yeah, I did.

1875
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:39,100
Because they said in general that they need to ensure everyone is in it.

1876
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:39,860
Ah.

1877
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,100
Yeah, I put mine in just now.

1878
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,120
Oh my god.

1879
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:50,400
What a freaking diabolical plan.

1880
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:52,920
To use sap for that.

1881
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:55,520
That shit actually made me crazy.

1882
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:01,740
My chat and I were like mentally drained.

1883
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:05,680
Wait, I actually didn't hear the plan because I was busy reading the rules.

1884
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:16,540
Oh, basically what he did, what your friend did, was that he convinced sap to yell as loud as he can to convince people to go on the other side of the map.

1885
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:21,980
So like, him and his friends would be on the other side.

1886
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:28,540
So the puppet would chase the people on the majority of the colors.

1887
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:32,900
So the people on the other side get to have a free run.

1888
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:37,560
Like a free reset, I guess.

1889
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:39,800
Ah, I see.

1890
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:47,880
So yeah, he convinced sap to yell as loud as he can to put everybody in one square while their group were on the opposite side.

1891
01:53:51,180 --> 01:53:52,680
And that was so evil.

1892
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,360
I can't believe us spitting on E-Rob's grave was on the main channel.

1893
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,040
I can't believe.

1894
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:02,920
Dude, why did they put that on the main channel?

1895
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:06,520
Yeah, we were doing so many other things.

1896
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:14,100
We were doing so many things like feeding the orphans, watering flowers, helping cats out of trees.

1897
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:18,040
We were like, showing people where the eggs are and everything.

1898
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,700
Being a good citizen.

1899
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:22,820
And then they show us spitting on E-Rob's grave.

1900
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:28,900
I can't believe it.

1901
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:33,260
This is like, propaganda.

1902
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:33,640
Propaganda?

1903
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:37,660
Why did you use that word?

1904
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:39,660
It's negative propaganda against us.

1905
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:40,700
It's slander!

1906
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,540
It's slander!

1907
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:48,820
Oh my god.

1908
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:52,180
This is the longest 5 seconds in the world.

1909
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:59,560
That's crazy that they have to check each and individual stream if we're in emote only mode.

1910
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:01,660
Actually, you've been wrong.

1911
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:05,000
It's easier to be a prop in this game mode.

1912
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:06,680
Why?

1913
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,480
It's way easier to be a prop.

1914
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:08,540
Oh, to get tasks, yeah.

1915
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:09,800
What with the new points?

1916
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,180
Yeah.

1917
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:13,040
Because I thought they were going to...

1918
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,340
Because the hunters get minus 2 points if they hit something wrong.

1919
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,680
Yeah, that's true.

1920
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:22,380
So it's kind of doomed.

1921
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:25,120
I'm just like, thinking like, how...

1922
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:27,580
Like, there's so many props too.

1923
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:29,440
Like, what if it's just a hitbox, you know?

1924
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,700
Like, the messed up hitbox that freaks you up.

1925
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:43,880
So, I think everybody should get a chance to play hunter once, right?

1926
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,500
Or is it like... It could be RNG though.

1927
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:48,940
Yeah, it's RNG.

1928
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:50,120
Yeah.

1929
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:52,040
So, and then like...

1930
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:55,000
But then when you die as a prop, you get respawned as a hunter.

1931
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:58,720
So, we have to also hunt as a prop.

1932
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,340
As we die.

1933
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:03,900
Right?

1934
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,300
Unless I misread it.

1935
01:56:07,540 --> 01:56:07,780
Huh?

1936
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,400
I wasn't listening.

1937
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:09,280
Oh!

1938
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:13,260
I said like, if we get caught as a prop, we have to hunt after that.

1939
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,720
Yeah, you become a hunter next.

1940
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:14,980
Yeah.

1941
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:19,180
Yeah, so like, it's just like, living as long as you can, doing tasks.

1942
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:21,040
Yeah.

1943
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:25,420
I just... Oh my god, it's just so... There were so many words.

1944
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:27,420
There were so many...

1945
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,540
It's okay, they're gonna play a video after this.

1946
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,060
Thank god.

1947
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:30,960
The video will help a lot.

1948
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:32,060
I need the visuals.

1949
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,800
I need...

1950
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,260
I need my Coco Melon.

1951
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:38,480
I need my Coco Melon, please.

1952
01:56:38,840 --> 01:56:39,500
Coco Melon.

1953
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:41,160
Coco Melon.

1954
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:41,640
Coco Melon.

1955
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:44,820
To be fair, that video on the last game was not helpful at all.

1956
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,800
Like, because it implied that you're safe.

1957
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,100
Like, you know, that like, it's not Majority.

1958
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:52,960
It didn't even say that in the rules either.

1959
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:53,460
Yeah.

1960
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,440
So, yeah.

1961
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,260
I...

1962
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:03,280
It was a tiny bit helpful knowing the dolls had abilities and showing which doll had what ability.

1963
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,360
Like, the fireball card?

1964
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

1965
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:06,140
And that...

1966
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:06,480
Yeah.

1967
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:10,400
I feel like this game is really well-coded though, from that last game.

1968
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,600
It's well-coded, but I feel like they should've tested the games more.

1969
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:21,000
Like, I feel like there's like, so many things that could've been adjusted if like, the games were tested a little bit more.

1970
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:23,260
Like, the tiebreaker one?

1971
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,820
You remember the tiebreaker on day one?

1972
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:31,700
And how there's like, barely enough time for people to like, do the tiebreaker if they got cursed?

1973
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:33,040
Yeah.

1974
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:34,780
Like, stuff like that.

1975
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,090
I got info about that tiebreaker.

1976
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,360
Apparently, you can see the person who's cursed, but you can't see the people who aren't cursed.

1977
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,820
It's like the other thing.

1978
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:47,300
Oh, so like, the people who are cursed can't even... don't even know where they are.

1979
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,140
No, but here, Doki, I'll teach you a trick.

1980
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:51,480
Yeah?

1981
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:57,540
Uh, if you play F5, and you just run around like this, you can scan around the area better.

1982
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:58,680
Oh.

1983
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:05,820
I- I know people keep telling me to play F5, but like, I'm so bad at moving when it comes to F5.

1984
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:07,460
Okay.

1985
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:23,740
Wait, that's a lot.

1986
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:25,160
Dying is bad.

1987
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:28,160
Wait,

1988
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,260
that's...

1989
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:34,220
dying is just bad.

1990
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,200
Wait, that's like, so long.

1991
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:39,640
You might as well just stand still.

1992
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:45,180
Oh, true.

1993
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:47,820
But still, I feel like...

1994
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:52,040
Okay.

1995
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:54,180
Yeah, that's true.

1996
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,460
We should've been talking about strats with them.

1997
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:06,440
Well, I guess we do have to play F5, chat, because it's a prop, so we have to know where people are.

1998
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:14,380
You just gotta, like, when you die as a prop, you become a hunter, so you just gotta stay locked in, no matter what you are, honestly.

1999
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:17,940
Like, either do your tasks, or go for prop kills.

2000
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:19,320
Goomy, goomy, goomy!

2001
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,080
Did you guys see the TV below this table?

2002
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:25,380
Made you look.

2003
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:26,560
There's no TV below the table.

2004
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:27,180
I don't believe you.

2005
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:28,620
Evil.

2006
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,040
I'm not helping you next time, chat.

2007
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:30,460
I looked.

2008
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:31,460
I'm not gonna lie, I did look.

2009
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:34,940
This one over here looks like a TV.

2010
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:39,580
Can't believe it.

2011
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,540
Oh, I'm here!

2012
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:41,280
I'm coming, I'm coming!

2013
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:46,680
Already discussing strats?

2014
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:48,380
Yeah, what's the strat?

2015
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:02,100
Go ahead.

2016
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:12,200
It's 5 points per kill, and it's only 2 for survival every 5 minutes.

2017
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,260
So you get so many more points as killing.

2018
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:28,160
So if you can speedrun your tasks fast, and then die, you can probably get a hunter within, like, 5 minutes-ish when you respawn, and then you can just get a lot of points killing people.

2019
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:29,880
And they can't do anything, because they're on respawn.

2020
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,380
I mean, depending on how far you wanna, like, try and game the system.

2021
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:38,960
I wonder if, like, props have, like, certain speeds, just like prop hunt.

2022
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:41,240
Like,

2023
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:49,000
the smaller the prop you are, the faster you can be, but you have less HP.

2024
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,360
Yeah, because I feel like large items should have more HP.

2025
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:00,780
Like, candle, chair, and something else, right?

2026
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,520
Oh my god, there's a squad of FBI.

2027
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:09,080
Bro, they're fucking walking like a squad.

2028
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:11,280
It's like, Mr. President, get down.

2029
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:16,020
Mr. President, get down.

2030
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:18,800
What the heck?

2031
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:19,840
Are they real people?

2032
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:23,800
Are those real people?

2033
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,840
They're so coordinated.

2034
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:32,980
What if we say, like, right now, we're gonna turn into, like, a very specific item, like a skull, right?

2035
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:35,800
I think I wanna turn into...

2036
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:39,420
Yeah, a skull probably would be the easiest.

2037
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:44,220
Yeah, the skull or, like, the...

2038
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:45,540
Candles?

2039
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,040
Yeah, candles.

2040
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,680
There's chairs, too.

2041
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:50,440
I haven't seen a lot of chairs here, though.

2042
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:52,580
It's like...

2043
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,620
Yeah, I mean...

2044
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,760
Those chairs are very, like, sort of big, like the ones in the kitchen.

2045
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,300
Yeah.

2046
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:02,600
I wonder what would be, like, the best spot to, like, hide.

2047
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,940
I'm just wondering what the tasks are.

2048
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:07,160
I hope they're, like...

2049
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:09,160
I hope the tasks are, like, somewhat easy.

2050
02:02:09,180 --> 02:02:10,200
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

2051
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:11,080
Like, I feel like...

2052
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,760
I mean, four tasks in ten minutes has gotta be easier.

2053
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:15,620
Yeah, but then I'm, like, wondering if they're gonna be, like, divided into different rooms.

2054
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:19,480
You're gonna see, like, props running around everywhere, trying to get to various rooms.

2055
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,080
Yeah.

2056
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:22,160
It's also gonna be, like...

2057
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:25,140
Because there's three different types of monsters with different powers, but we don't know what that is.

2058
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:25,460
Yeah.

2059
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:25,940
Yeah.

2060
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:31,020
Like, if there's one that just has, like, a sensor that there's a monster in the room, you just stay AFK in that room for a minute and wait for them to move.

2061
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:33,500
I think it could be one that gives you, like, a speed boost.

2062
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,940
One that maybe helps you find props that are hidden.

2063
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:40,680
And one that... I don't know what the third one could be, but...

2064
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:42,500
Maybe, like, a range ability or some kind.

2065
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:43,640
Ooh.

2066
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:45,360
Oh, my gosh.

2067
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,960
Finally, the timer started.

2068
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:50,520
Yay!

2069
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:57,090
And then on the... Like, let's say you're in a tie.

2070
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:01,990
It's a free-for-all deathmatch, so you just, like, want to be with your ally if you have any in there.

2071
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:03,110
And then target the other people.

2072
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:10,230
Wouldn't the tiebreaker be only one person survive out of everybody?

2073
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:13,310
Well, probably because of how many eliminations they need.

2074
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:13,770
So, like...

2075
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:17,270
Like, let's say multiple people have the same amount of points in the bottom 30.

2076
02:03:19,050 --> 02:03:20,610
It's like... I think we'll see a tiebreaker.

2077
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:21,250
I'm not gonna lie.

2078
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:23,090
Oh, yeah.

2079
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:28,310
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get knocked out.

2080
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:30,090
I'm gonna get knocked out.

2081
02:03:31,810 --> 02:03:32,890
Oh, my God.

2082
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,270
This is not RNG.

2083
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:36,170
This is actually tryhard time.

2084
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:37,490
Yeah, right?

2085
02:03:39,070 --> 02:03:40,070
This is not fair.

2086
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:43,210
What happened to the RNG?

2087
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:43,330
RNG.

2088
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:48,510
You know, we made it this far, guys.

2089
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:50,130
We made it to day three.

2090
02:03:54,670 --> 02:03:55,930
All four of us?

2091
02:03:55,930 --> 02:03:56,090
Okay.

2092
02:03:56,550 --> 02:03:58,670
I don't know what kind of copium you have.

2093
02:04:05,630 --> 02:04:06,110
Yeah.

2094
02:04:07,830 --> 02:04:08,210
Yeah.

2095
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:12,730
All right.

2096
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:14,070
Okay.

2097
02:04:14,410 --> 02:04:15,650
I'll give you guys...

2098
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:17,140
I'll give you guys points if...

2099
02:04:17,710 --> 02:04:17,890
Wait, no.

2100
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:18,390
That's colluding.

2101
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:20,390
I was gonna say, I'll give you guys points if you split the money.

2102
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:21,070
Wait.

2103
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:23,850
Okay.

2104
02:04:24,710 --> 02:04:27,110
If you guys make it to top 20...

2105
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:28,670
If you guys make it...

2106
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:31,090
I'll give you guys points if you guys split your cash earnings.

2107
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:33,470
If you make it to top 20.

2108
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:36,950
Good luck.

2109
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:41,270
Oh, my God.

2110
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:42,670
Here we go.

2111
02:04:43,310 --> 02:04:44,290
You don't even get the video?

2112
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:45,010
Oh, I'm hunted.

2113
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:45,470
I'm hunted.

2114
02:04:45,670 --> 02:04:48,610
Oh, I'm hunted.

2115
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:49,550
I'm hunted.

2116
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:50,790
Die, die, die.

2117
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:51,410
Help.

2118
02:04:55,710 --> 02:04:57,510
We're still waiting?

2119
02:04:58,210 --> 02:04:59,490
There's more?

2120
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:00,330
What?

2121
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:02,250
Bro, there's...

2122
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,250
They just...

2123
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:07,110
They posted more rules.

2124
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:09,670
How are there more rules?

2125
02:05:10,670 --> 02:05:11,490
Bro, okay.

2126
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:12,870
Give me a sec.

2127
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:14,370
Let me read this.

2128
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:15,250
All right.

2129
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:16,450
Okay.

2130
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:20,370
Okay.

2131
02:05:31,370 --> 02:05:33,050
We count steps taken?

2132
02:05:38,110 --> 02:05:39,070
Okay.

2133
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:40,970
All right.

2134
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:42,750
I sort of registered this.

2135
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:47,150
I was like, how is there more?

2136
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:51,670
I was so surprised.

2137
02:05:52,130 --> 02:05:54,810
I was like, there's more to reading?

2138
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:01,000
I'm crouching up and down in the corner.

2139
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:02,730
Okay.

2140
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:04,690
What is this?

2141
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:06,650
This is it.

2142
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:09,850
This is it, guys.

2143
02:06:10,370 --> 02:06:11,770
I feel like...

2144
02:06:11,770 --> 02:06:12,730
Guys, I feel like...

2145
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:15,410
When I'm a hunter, I have to play in first person.

2146
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:22,230
I think as a hunter, I would absolutely accidentally hit other things if I wasn't first person.

2147
02:06:23,010 --> 02:06:31,970
Because I don't play enough Minecraft to realize where the hitboxes are.

2148
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:34,150
Like, I'm so bad with hitboxes.

2149
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:37,350
Oh my god.

2150
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:41,970
Oh my god.

2151
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:44,610
Please show me the video of what the tasks are.

2152
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:48,450
I wanna know what the tasks are.

2153
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:57,350
I'm gonna steal his...

2154
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:03,190
Stealing intel.

2155
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,650
Stealing strats right now.

2156
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:15,510
It wouldn't matter anyway because I don't know what I'm doing.

2157
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:17,850
I feel like these Minecraft players know more than me.

2158
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:22,110
Thanks for the free intel.

2159
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,750
Loser.

2160
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:31,590
But not really a loser because they might have a chance of winning $70,000 because they play this game more.

2161
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:34,670
But still, thanks for revealing your strats.

2162
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:41,850
Yeah.

2163
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:44,970
Alright, here we go.

2164
02:07:45,910 --> 02:07:47,070
We made it.

2165
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:49,190
Wait, we all have one bar?

2166
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:53,730
Wait.

2167
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:57,710
The heck?

2168
02:07:59,390 --> 02:08:02,490
Someone chat was like, we all have one bar.

2169
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:05,070
They kicked us out?

2170
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:08,870
This is everyone getting kicked out.

2171
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,410
Okay, now it's okay.

2172
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:15,090
That was crazy.

2173
02:08:15,850 --> 02:08:21,310
Someone in the chat was like, everybody has one bar and then we all got kicked out.

2174
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:26,510
Guys, I think they started the server on the opposite side of the world.

2175
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:30,230
On the opposite side of NA.

2176
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:31,950
I'm pretty sure.

2177
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:32,810
NA and SA.

2178
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:37,910
I think they started the server in Japan or something.

2179
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:41,350
Because why did all of us get one bar?

2180
02:08:41,490 --> 02:08:42,290
That was crazy.

2181
02:08:46,190 --> 02:08:48,090
They are going to fix the server.

2182
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:52,910
Okay, they are going to move us again soon.

2183
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:56,450
My heart, man.

2184
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:59,570
This has been the most stressful rest week of my life.

2185
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:03,850
Oh, Doki.

2186
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:05,530
I got some bad news.

2187
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:06,790
Yeah, what's the bad news?

2188
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:08,950
We all discussed it.

2189
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:10,450
We are going to target you.

2190
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:11,290
Wait, what?

2191
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:11,850
Why me?

2192
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:15,430
Yeah, I'm not going to, but they all want to.

2193
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:15,930
Wait, what?

2194
02:09:15,930 --> 02:09:16,790
What did I do?

2195
02:09:17,570 --> 02:09:18,870
They just want you out.

2196
02:09:20,330 --> 02:09:21,770
Apparently, you are too good.

2197
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:24,390
And yeah, Gumi said she was gunning for you.

2198
02:09:24,570 --> 02:09:24,970
Oh, okay.

2199
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:25,770
Now I know you are lying.

2200
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:27,110
Gumi would never throw me out.

2201
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:27,890
You are lying.

2202
02:09:28,490 --> 02:09:29,350
We have a pact.

2203
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:30,230
Gumi would never.

2204
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:31,010
Oh my god.

2205
02:09:31,070 --> 02:09:32,210
I'm telling Gumi this.

2206
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:33,310
I'm telling Gumi this.

2207
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:38,750
Where is Gumi?

2208
02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:40,350
Gumi would never.

2209
02:09:41,090 --> 02:09:43,490
She would never rat me out.

2210
02:09:45,650 --> 02:09:47,850
Gumi would never do such a thing.

2211
02:09:48,370 --> 02:09:49,150
Wait, where is she?

2212
02:09:52,370 --> 02:09:53,050
What?

2213
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:56,550
Someone said I gotta buy an account.

2214
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:03,930
Alright, where is she?

2215
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:06,210
I'm going to rat him out.

2216
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:07,890
It's over.

2217
02:10:08,790 --> 02:10:10,150
It's over for him.

2218
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:13,670
Gumi would never.

2219
02:10:13,970 --> 02:10:16,170
She would never do such a thing to me.

2220
02:10:18,570 --> 02:10:20,870
Also, like, how do you target people anyway?

2221
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:24,550
Like, you can't even see any.

2222
02:10:24,990 --> 02:10:26,870
You are literally a prop.

2223
02:10:30,230 --> 02:10:30,970
That's messed up.

2224
02:10:31,530 --> 02:10:32,590
That's messed up.

2225
02:10:32,730 --> 02:10:33,950
That breaks rule 33.

2226
02:10:34,990 --> 02:10:38,350
No negative behavior.

2227
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:46,930
That breaks rule 33.

2228
02:10:48,370 --> 02:10:54,150
This has to be a positive... Oh wait, I broke rule 33 when I was on the main broadcast.

2229
02:10:54,890 --> 02:10:55,210
Hahaha.

2230
02:10:57,490 --> 02:10:58,130
Whoops.

2231
02:10:58,670 --> 02:10:59,310
Oopsie.

2232
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,990
It's okay.

2233
02:11:01,110 --> 02:11:03,190
It was in...

2234
02:11:03,190 --> 02:11:04,350
It was like...

2235
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:07,370
Like a positive thing that happened there.

2236
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:09,170
Where is she?

2237
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:11,470
I don't know where she is.

2238
02:11:13,330 --> 02:11:14,770
Where did she go?

2239
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:17,150
That was actually crazy.

2240
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:20,290
I realized a lot of Minecraft players died during the first game.

2241
02:11:20,910 --> 02:11:23,310
Which is insane to think about for me.

2242
02:11:23,970 --> 02:11:24,450
Hahaha.

2243
02:11:24,810 --> 02:11:25,410
I don't know.

2244
02:11:26,230 --> 02:11:32,730
I actually think it's like actually crazy that I lived longer than a lot of like...

2245
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:36,330
A lot of the well-known Minecraft players in this game.

2246
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:42,750
Oh, they're angry about the rules.

2247
02:11:43,710 --> 02:11:44,830
They're angry about the rules.

2248
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:47,950
Whatever amount of people... Could it be hunter then?

2249
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:04,990
It's a little silly.

2250
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:06,830
There's like...

2251
02:12:06,830 --> 02:12:06,830
Yeah.

2252
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:10,810
It's definitely like speedrunning and then dying.

2253
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:14,530
It's just depending on like how hard the tasks are.

2254
02:12:14,530 --> 02:12:15,870
And if you're able to do them all.

2255
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:17,750
Yeah.

2256
02:12:18,610 --> 02:12:19,710
A lot of question marks.

2257
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:23,970
I think the cinematic will give a few of those questions answers.

2258
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:25,790
Yeah, that's the thing.

2259
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:27,590
I think some people are tweaking about the rules.

2260
02:12:27,690 --> 02:12:29,710
But I feel like the cinematic will make it so much more simpler.

2261
02:12:34,210 --> 02:12:35,230
Oh my god.

2262
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:36,810
I'm stealing the strats.

2263
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:38,030
Oh my god.

2264
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:40,370
I hear people complaining.

2265
02:12:41,790 --> 02:12:43,490
And I gotta steal the strats.

2266
02:12:43,490 --> 02:12:46,490
I gotta steal the strats from the speedrunners.

2267
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:52,050
From the Minecraft speedrunners gamers.

2268
02:12:56,410 --> 02:13:01,110
Oh, is that the remaining Spanish players?

2269
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:01,930
Is that it?

2270
02:13:02,710 --> 02:13:04,110
I thought there was more.

2271
02:13:04,350 --> 02:13:05,090
There must be more.

2272
02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:06,530
I'm pretty sure.

2273
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:10,010
You know what?

2274
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:11,090
There's 80 of us.

2275
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:13,710
They must have been separated into other groups.

2276
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:17,230
I'm just trying to find Goomy.

2277
02:13:17,970 --> 02:13:20,030
So I can rat bad boy out.

2278
02:13:20,810 --> 02:13:21,750
Can't believe it.

2279
02:13:22,190 --> 02:13:23,870
I almost believed him.

2280
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:27,770
Until he said Goomy threw me under the bus.

2281
02:13:28,410 --> 02:13:30,290
After everything she did.

2282
02:13:30,630 --> 02:13:33,610
There was no way she would throw me under the bus.

2283
02:13:34,850 --> 02:13:37,510
She already wasted so much time.

2284
02:13:38,270 --> 02:13:40,750
Like dragging me through the finish line.

2285
02:13:40,750 --> 02:13:42,770
For so many days.

2286
02:13:42,910 --> 02:13:44,630
Why stop now?

2287
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:51,670
She dragged me to the finish line.

2288
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:54,390
So why would she stop now?

2289
02:13:56,530 --> 02:13:59,310
That's when I knew he was lying.

2290
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:05,190
Is she just AFK?

2291
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:07,790
I feel like I haven't bumped into her at all.

2292
02:14:09,590 --> 02:14:10,830
Guys, yay or nay?

2293
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:11,710
Is she AFK?

2294
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:15,910
Or is she actually moving around so that I couldn't...

2295
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:17,710
I just barely missed her.

2296
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:18,310
She's not?

2297
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:18,750
Okay.

2298
02:14:20,530 --> 02:14:21,010
Okay.

2299
02:14:21,410 --> 02:14:22,450
I'm just unlucky.

2300
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,540
Alright, the strategy is to do tasks.

2301
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:32,360
I'm just unlucky.

2302
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:34,600
What the heck?

2303
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,060
Where could she have gone?

2304
02:14:39,970 --> 02:14:41,330
Wait, is that... no?

2305
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:43,370
There's only two people outside.

2306
02:14:45,730 --> 02:14:50,390
Oh my god, this is a harder hide and seek than the actual hide and seek game.

2307
02:14:54,730 --> 02:14:58,010
This is actually a harder hide and seek game.

2308
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:03,210
Now I'm playing the real minigame.

2309
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:07,650
For example, you know the TNT tag game that they played to get people out?

2310
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:16,970
Intel.

2311
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:34,640
Just gotta be sneaky.

2312
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:37,200
Just wanted the intel.

2313
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:39,620
They know what they're doing?

2314
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:41,520
They're actual Minecraft players.

2315
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:43,600
Wanted to know.

2316
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,300
A minute and a half?

2317
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:51,840
Jesus.

2318
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:53,580
That's so long.

2319
02:15:55,220 --> 02:15:56,060
Around this side?

2320
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:00,360
No.

2321
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:01,400
Gumi!

2322
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:02,960
Gumi!

2323
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:04,260
Gumi!

2324
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:07,380
You wouldn't throw me under the bus, right Gumi?

2325
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:14,960
Bad boy was saying everybody was gonna throw me under the bus, including you.

2326
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,440
But I didn't believe it.

2327
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:21,040
I didn't believe it because I was like Gumi would never.

2328
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,160
That's what I said!

2329
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:28,900
I was like, there's no way!

2330
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:33,060
Gumi dragged me to the finish line, why would she throw me under now?

2331
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:37,800
Bad boy's a liar, don't trust him.

2332
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:40,200
He tried to scare me.

2333
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:43,740
He tried to tell me, he's such a bad boy.

2334
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,140
Oh man.

2335
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:57,440
Yeah, but it doesn't matter though.

2336
02:16:57,900 --> 02:16:58,580
The eggs do nothing.

2337
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:06,760
Okay, but you gotta live to like the last day.

2338
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:09,460
Nah, I'd win.

2339
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:16,000
Nah, I'd win.

2340
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:17,960
What if they give everyone 20 eggs?

2341
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:21,800
And they paste in the translation.

2342
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,260
Translation, Raptor, translation.

2343
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:28,960
No,

2344
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:33,000
I feel that too.

2345
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:37,540
I feel that too.

2346
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:38,780
Okay, I found absolutely nothing.

2347
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:42,540
He's my friend, not your friend.

2348
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:43,780
I have 28.

2349
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:47,140
I heard that they like activate the eggs late too sometimes.

2350
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:48,660
Say him that you're my friend.

2351
02:17:48,660 --> 02:17:50,380
Oh, I heard that too.

2352
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:53,980
Yeah, yeah, because someone in the general chat like activated the eggs.

2353
02:17:54,180 --> 02:18:00,620
The final egg was activated after half the day was over.

2354
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:02,640
Yeah, that's so...

2355
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:05,040
That's so... that's messed up.

2356
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,300
That's actually messed up.

2357
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:09,060
Oh, here we go.

2358
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:12,720
Here we go.

2359
02:18:14,660 --> 02:18:19,040
You know, if a non-Minecraft player makes it to day 4, that's a goddamn win in my book.

2360
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,640
Well, there's a lot of non-Minecraft players.

2361
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:26,960
No, there is... you know damn well the majority of the players here that are live are Minecraft players.

2362
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:29,720
The one that Red died to was like the fast one.

2363
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:32,500
Like it was like super speed, like super fast or something.

2364
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:34,660
So I guess that's like a thing.

2365
02:18:34,980 --> 02:18:35,760
I hear him coming.

2366
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:40,260
Did you ever hide in the thingy?

2367
02:18:40,260 --> 02:18:42,640
No, because they were saying that they camped people.

2368
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:44,440
Oh, I hid in one.

2369
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:45,440
Wait, did it work?

2370
02:18:46,780 --> 02:18:49,420
Well, it was busy chasing someone else.

2371
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:56,220
I didn't hide because like people were saying that like the puppet was camping people outside.

2372
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:56,680
Really?

2373
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:57,740
Oh, that's scary.

2374
02:18:58,020 --> 02:18:59,040
Yeah, so then I didn't hide.

2375
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,060
So I got scared.

2376
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:00,680
Good luck.

2377
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:02,040
Good luck, everybody.

2378
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:03,200
Good luck.

2379
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:04,820
If you see me, run into me.

2380
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:05,280
It's a prop.

2381
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:06,900
Yeah, yeah.

2382
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:07,360
Give me...

2383
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:07,660
Thank you.

2384
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:10,160
Let's go.

2385
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:10,920
Back in my house.

2386
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,320
Now we're not one boss.

2387
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:14,920
Oh, wait a minute.

2388
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,500
We're not one boss now.

2389
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:21,380
Everybody to the other edge of the corner so you don't...

2390
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:23,840
You can only start as a hunter one round.

2391
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:26,020
Oh, good tech.

2392
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:26,320
Yeah.

2393
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:27,000
Interesting.

2394
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:27,820
How do you know that?

2395
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:29,860
And there's a two minute respawn.

2396
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:31,580
It is.

2397
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,660
It is.

2398
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:33,960
Yeah, read general chat.

2399
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:35,680
They gave a lot of tips.

2400
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:37,180
Wait, what was the...

2401
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:38,200
Wait, what was the tips?

2402
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:38,320
You can peek.

2403
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:38,820
You can peek.

2404
02:19:38,940 --> 02:19:39,480
What do you think?

2405
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:43,120
You are my friend.

2406
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:46,800
Wow, he's a Naruto enjoyer?

2407
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,080
And when I'm listening to the intel...

2408
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:52,360
You are my friend.

2409
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:54,680
Are you listening to the intel?

2410
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:55,480
Yeah.

2411
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:57,860
I don't know the lyrics.

2412
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,280
We've been in emote mode for like years now.

2413
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:06,540
Only two hours have passed.

2414
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:07,960
I swear, I feel like...

2415
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:12,160
I feel like I've been trapped in this purgatory for like eight years.

2416
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:13,520
Since day one.

2417
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:18,380
Since day one, I've been in purgatory.

2418
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:19,940
I'll remember you guys.

2419
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:21,840
For eight years.

2420
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:25,540
And it's not gonna be me.

2421
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:26,860
I love Minecraft.

2422
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:29,700
I love Minecraft.

2423
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:36,640
Don't worry, Ant.

2424
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:38,000
Ant, we got this plan.

2425
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,300
Okay, voice chat will be gone soon, guys.

2426
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:42,900
It's like a farm.

2427
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:43,740
Yeah.

2428
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:45,020
Oh, it's like a...

2429
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:45,540
Yeah.

2430
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,620
I feel like...

2431
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:51,540
I feel like one of those pets...

2432
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:54,880
That's had their lifespan extended...

2433
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:56,560
For like way too long.

2434
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,720
You know what I mean?

2435
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:00,540
By like ultra rich owners...

2436
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:02,660
And they extend their pet's lifespan...

2437
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:04,740
To like...

2438
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,860
Longer than they should have been alive.

2439
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:11,340
In this event.

2440
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,140
And Goomy's the owner.

2441
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:16,920
Goomy has extended my lifespan to the point where like...

2442
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:19,240
It should not be possible for me to be here.

2443
02:21:22,880 --> 02:21:24,160
I should not...

2444
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:26,360
I'm like blind in both eyes.

2445
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:28,060
Like crawling right now.

2446
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:29,520
I need to wear a diaper.

2447
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:30,560
I'm like, please.

2448
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:35,060
Like how am I still...

2449
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:36,280
How am I still alive?

2450
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:41,160
He was.

2451
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:44,860
Two minutes left.

2452
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:45,880
What?

2453
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:47,080
Keep the respawn timer.

2454
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,220
No, that's if he dies.

2455
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:50,600
Oh, I see.

2456
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:51,920
Yeah.

2457
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:52,960
No problem, no problem.

2458
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:53,940
It's reduced.

2459
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:56,300
They said it was reduced like...

2460
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:01,540
Wait, that's messed up.

2461
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:03,320
That is crazy.

2462
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:04,100
Why can you hear that?

2463
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:09,480
I know for a fact because I've read all this out loud.

2464
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:10,040
Oh my god.

2465
02:22:10,340 --> 02:22:12,000
Somewhere me and Wally noticed that.

2466
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:14,660
You are my friend.

2467
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:18,500
Who are like the non-Minecraft players still alive?

2468
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:19,500
It's me?

2469
02:22:20,060 --> 02:22:20,400
It is.

2470
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:22,940
You can't say Gumi because she plays a lot of Minecraft.

2471
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:25,520
Like she plays exponentially a lot.

2472
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:26,480
A large amount.

2473
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:29,960
She's part of like at least two different Minecraft servers.

2474
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:32,280
Like at least two.

2475
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:33,220
Yeah.

2476
02:22:33,740 --> 02:22:35,000
Okay, you guys can't talk to me.

2477
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,140
So yeah, I don't even know.

2478
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:36,960
I'm talking to myself.

2479
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:41,640
I'm actually curious who's like not a Minecraft player that's still alive.

2480
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:47,500
Yeah, but you have to wait two minutes whenever you die.

2481
02:22:47,820 --> 02:22:48,900
Yeah, that's true.

2482
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,380
You have to wait two minutes and after everybody's doing it, then like there's going to be less people to kill anyway.

2483
02:22:54,520 --> 02:23:00,420
So far what we've seen is very open, but I assume past the corridors it'll be like even more closed off.

2484
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:00,900
I don't know guys, I'm scared.

2485
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:02,120
Dude, your ass is out.

2486
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:02,940
I'm scared too.

2487
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:03,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2488
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:03,920
Okay.

2489
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:05,920
This is a little more disaster-y.

2490
02:23:07,660 --> 02:23:08,460
Five minutes.

2491
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:09,220
Another five?

2492
02:23:09,220 --> 02:23:11,540
I know we can't sing a song, but can we make up a song together?

2493
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:14,360
Unassociated with the normal Hunter and Spawn period.

2494
02:23:16,340 --> 02:23:18,780
Wait, do we have to increase it on our own as well?

2495
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:22,120
See, I feel like when we were singing the clapping hands song, it was feeling good.

2496
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:23,180
It was making my nerves.

2497
02:23:25,020 --> 02:23:27,660
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

2498
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:32,680
But I think doing tasks and then like dying quickly is actually good.

2499
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:33,880
That was, who did that?

2500
02:23:34,220 --> 02:23:34,620
Yes!

2501
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:37,760
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

2502
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:42,340
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

2503
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:44,020
Clap, clap.

2504
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:45,840
I feel like we're trying to cope.

2505
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:47,860
See, that made me feel better, you know?

2506
02:23:48,220 --> 02:23:49,180
I feel better.

2507
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:49,840
I feel lighter.

2508
02:23:50,020 --> 02:23:50,920
I feel a little lighter.

2509
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:53,400
We're like inhaling some copium at the moment.

2510
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:55,260
We're gaslighting each other.

2511
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:55,860
It's not gone.

2512
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:56,800
It's not gone.

2513
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:02,100
Remember this, if you die...

2514
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:03,580
Game, you die in real life.

2515
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,800
In real life, exactly!

2516
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:08,300
Guys, I'm gonna die in real life.

2517
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:11,040
Oh, I can't.

2518
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:12,040
I can't.

2519
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:14,260
I can't.

2520
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:16,980
I've lived through enough.

2521
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:21,780
Oh, thank God.

2522
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:26,840
Wait, again?

2523
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:28,200
Why are you...

2524
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,880
Oh my God!

2525
02:24:30,940 --> 02:24:33,180
Just eliminate me now!

2526
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,360
Just eliminate... Just take me out!

2527
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:43,580
This is how to get you.

2528
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:47,740
This is literally how to get you.

2529
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:51,720
Just eliminate me now.

2530
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:59,960
Oh my God.

2531
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:07,160
Wait, do we need to render to higher than 10?

2532
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:08,620
Increasing?

2533
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:09,400
You're not gonna lag.

2534
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:10,940
Just crank it.

2535
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:13,480
You're not gonna lag, bro.

2536
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:15,600
Just crank it, dad.

2537
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:20,140
Oh my God.

2538
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:21,600
Please.

2539
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:25,360
I think this is psychological torture.

2540
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,960
They're trying to push us to our limit.

2541
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:36,260
This is squid game.

2542
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:38,760
This is actually squid game.

2543
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:43,440
This is squid game IRL.

2544
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:44,940
What's your strat gonna be?

2545
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:48,600
Yeah, it's nice, peace and quiet.

2546
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:53,220
I feel like this is real squid game.

2547
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:54,800
This is psychological torture.

2548
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:58,540
I think that should be a good thing.

2549
02:25:58,540 --> 02:25:59,400
Yeah, tasks.

2550
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:00,840
They bait us.

2551
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:03,520
They put us in a room that we got in.

2552
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:04,560
Yeah, daily tasks.

2553
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:06,180
And then they take us back to the lobby.

2554
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,180
To see who cracks first.

2555
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:11,340
Am I alive, Mr. Turner?

2556
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:11,940
I will try.

2557
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:13,220
I will try, Hannah.

2558
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:13,800
Very good.

2559
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:15,920
Aw, thank you.

2560
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:17,200
I'll do my best.

2561
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:18,100
That was mean.

2562
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:20,100
I want you to win.

2563
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:22,260
Can't we share corners?

2564
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:23,680
I can help you.

2565
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,320
You can do it.

2566
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:27,320
Yeah, but we can share corners.

2567
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:31,420
I can share tips with you.

2568
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:32,580
What's the tip?

2569
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:33,780
You first.

2570
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:34,460
Hey!

2571
02:26:34,860 --> 02:26:36,660
No, I got no tips for you.

2572
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:38,100
No, I'm not your friend.

2573
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:39,100
No corner for you.

2574
02:26:40,980 --> 02:26:42,100
Oh my god.

2575
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:43,080
I'm on my other side.

2576
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:45,020
I'm your friend.

2577
02:26:45,060 --> 02:26:45,240
Why?

2578
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:51,720
Man, I love how people are screaming because loud equals funny.

2579
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:52,640
Loud equals funny.

2580
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:52,680
Loud equals funny.

2581
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:55,560
I'm going to be so loud to be so funny.

2582
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:57,080
I'm going to make people laugh.

2583
02:26:57,080 --> 02:26:59,520
I'm going to make people laugh by being really loud real quick.

2584
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:00,380
Yeah, do it.

2585
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:00,560
Do it.

2586
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:00,820
Scream.

2587
02:27:00,980 --> 02:27:01,980
Scream right now, Gumi.

2588
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:02,380
Do it.

2589
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:03,220
You're going to have so many fans.

2590
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:05,160
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2591
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:06,060
Look, everyone is going to laugh.

2592
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:09,940
You just died!

2593
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:12,560
Shit,

2594
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:16,980
the timing.

2595
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:19,660
I don't want to hear you guys.

2596
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:24,880
Silencio!

2597
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:26,320
Stop speaking Spanish!

2598
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:30,540
That was a cool man.

2599
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:44,720
Hey, shut up.

2600
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:48,380
The grenade.

2601
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:58,080
What?

2602
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,300
The fuck?

2603
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:04,040
Heck, the heck.

2604
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:26,580
There's no... there's no task.

2605
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:07,140
What?

2606
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:12,900
What's a puzzle?

2607
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:19,260
What?

2608
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,900
No!

2609
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:40,680
No!

2610
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:48,440
This is not... this is a puzzle!

2611
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:52,100
Why didn't we have these puzzles yesterday?

2612
02:29:57,100 --> 02:29:59,620
This is an actual puzzle!

2613
02:30:00,820 --> 02:30:02,660
We had tasks yesterday!

2614
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:05,300
Yesterday's tasks should have been today's tasks!

2615
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:21,200
Goodbye!

2616
02:30:32,380 --> 02:30:34,720
I'm going to be right here.

2617
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:39,520
This is where I'm going to be.

2618
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:44,140
Oh my god.

2619
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:49,920
This is... that's so dumb!

2620
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:52,660
This is a puzzle!

2621
02:30:53,180 --> 02:30:54,220
These are puzzles!

2622
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:55,760
These are tasks!

2623
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,340
Not the actual puzzles!

2624
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:03,680
No!

2625
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:06,760
I cannot chat to help me!

2626
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:08,720
No!

2627
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:24,200
Chat can't even backseat me on puzzles!

2628
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:28,900
I have to think for my own?

2629
02:31:29,660 --> 02:31:33,580
What's the point of being a streamer if we have to do our own thinking?

2630
02:31:38,720 --> 02:31:40,000
Wait, what the heck?

2631
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:43,000
Wait, everybody can talk?

2632
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:44,140
Silence!

2633
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:49,120
I'm so stressed.

2634
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:58,460
But then you're giving people free points.

2635
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:00,860
If everyone does that, the round's going to end in like 25 seconds.

2636
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:04,980
Some of them seem pretty easy.

2637
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:06,900
I think it's better to die early.

2638
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,900
The task seems hard.

2639
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:11,440
If you do the same thing in the round, it's not that bad.

2640
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:15,520
The timer's longer in the first round.

2641
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:19,640
Guys, this is bad.

2642
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:21,980
I have to think for myself, guys.

2643
02:32:22,740 --> 02:32:23,640
Guys, this is bad.

2644
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:26,180
I'm supposed to be a puppet for my chat.

2645
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:28,580
I regurgitate everything they tell me.

2646
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:29,300
This is bad.

2647
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:33,600
I spent four years being a streamer to not think for myself.

2648
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:38,860
To not do problem solving for myself.

2649
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:41,900
Now, I actually have to use my brain.

2650
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:46,360
Guys, it's not like riding a bicycle where I can just use my brain again.

2651
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:47,800
Guys, it's not like that.

2652
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:49,160
Guys, I'm really stupid.

2653
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:50,100
I don't know if you guys know this.

2654
02:32:50,220 --> 02:32:51,100
I'm really, really stupid.

2655
02:32:56,020 --> 02:32:58,800
It's not like that, guys.

2656
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:00,900
That's just great.

2657
02:33:01,700 --> 02:33:05,440
50% of my brain cells have been on vacation, and they are not coming back.

2658
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,820
They're still using their vacation days.

2659
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,840
Is it code for the chest?

2660
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,700
Yeah, code for a chest.

2661
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:13,200
Finding a key for a chest.

2662
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:14,860
And then just finding something.

2663
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:18,160
Yeah, and then find a hex chest behind stairs?

2664
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:20,120
Yeah, find a hex chest on stairs.

2665
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:24,120
Okay, but like for the code one, how do you think the code one works?

2666
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:27,900
There will be codes randomly everywhere, I think.

2667
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:31,860
I wonder if the tasks will disappear after someone finishes.

2668
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:33,620
There's no way, right?

2669
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:35,580
You just follow the horn again.

2670
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:40,660
Who's up?

2671
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:46,280
Wait, how come they can...

2672
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:49,000
Is it like puta, bad word?

2673
02:33:49,420 --> 02:33:50,380
E or ne?

2674
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:52,060
How do I know that word?

2675
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:55,780
Wait, why do they keep swearing in Spanish?

2676
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:56,440
Really?

2677
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,840
Like, we can't swear in English.

2678
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:00,920
Yeah, but I think that's Spanish.

2679
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:04,620
Wait a minute.

2680
02:34:05,300 --> 02:34:05,940
Yeah, it is acting.

2681
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:07,720
Oh, wait, no, I mean like...

2682
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:10,140
I don't know.

2683
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:12,080
I thought the green one, the highlights?

2684
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:13,060
Rocks?

2685
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:20,800
I was listening to the freaking cinematic!

2686
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,160
You dumb people!

2687
02:34:26,670 --> 02:34:29,590
Sorry, I need to take my meds for like five seconds.

2688
02:34:32,670 --> 02:34:33,070
Why?

2689
02:34:34,830 --> 02:34:35,510
Why is it why?

2690
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:37,930
Because if you're running past another prop, you're going to think it's fine.

2691
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:38,990
You get free hits that way.

2692
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:43,070
Say that again?

2693
02:34:45,930 --> 02:34:46,890
The prop one?

2694
02:34:47,190 --> 02:34:48,690
Imagine you're running past another prop.

2695
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:50,050
You're going to be like, oh, that's chill.

2696
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:52,670
It could be a hunter.

2697
02:34:53,690 --> 02:34:56,330
If you see a prop running, you think there's a hunter behind them.

2698
02:34:56,670 --> 02:35:00,450
No, but like, there's a hint that the hunter can be a prop.

2699
02:35:00,930 --> 02:35:03,390
No, I know, but why as a prop?

2700
02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:04,570
Would you see a prop running?

2701
02:35:05,830 --> 02:35:07,570
Like, would you not think a hunter's behind them?

2702
02:35:07,970 --> 02:35:09,070
No, they're just looking for things.

2703
02:35:09,290 --> 02:35:10,730
Maybe they're looking for tasks, yeah.

2704
02:35:12,770 --> 02:35:14,850
Do we think there's only one set of eyes?

2705
02:35:15,350 --> 02:35:16,710
Or do we think there's three?

2706
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:18,410
There's three.

2707
02:35:18,650 --> 02:35:19,650
And you need to do all three.

2708
02:35:20,770 --> 02:35:21,930
All three of what?

2709
02:35:22,010 --> 02:35:24,310
You have to do all three of the tasks?

2710
02:35:26,910 --> 02:35:28,470
That's so much!

2711
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:30,530
I don't know, the tasks are kind of concerning me.

2712
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:31,150
They're a bit complex.

2713
02:35:32,790 --> 02:35:34,290
There's like three chests, right?

2714
02:35:34,490 --> 02:35:38,110
I don't know, I think it's learning a little more about the tasks and not speaking.

2715
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:38,690
This is perfect.

2716
02:35:40,690 --> 02:35:41,770
This is perfect.

2717
02:35:43,270 --> 02:35:47,630
The best part is figuring out how to do them and hopefully not dying.

2718
02:35:49,230 --> 02:35:52,630
I also think it would be nice to be the hunter the first round just so you can see things.

2719
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:54,770
I agree, I would rather be the hunter the first round.

2720
02:35:57,710 --> 02:35:59,650
Whoever starts as hunter gets huge advantage.

2721
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:04,710
I just think it's crazy that being a hunter all you need is five kills and then you get more points than any prop could get.

2722
02:36:07,430 --> 02:36:09,570
Being a hunter seems like an advantage.

2723
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:13,970
Oh, so it's that simple?

2724
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:14,810
Yeah.

2725
02:36:16,310 --> 02:36:18,070
I feel like I should just survive.

2726
02:36:20,430 --> 02:36:24,210
I feel like I should survive instead of doing tasks.

2727
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:29,450
If you have to complete all three tasks to get five points, it's not worth it.

2728
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:56,690
Maybe a skull?

2729
02:36:57,450 --> 02:37:00,410
I can't change into a prop for 12 seconds?

2730
02:37:02,430 --> 02:37:03,250
I don't know.

2731
02:37:04,470 --> 02:37:06,250
I want to be a...

2732
02:37:07,830 --> 02:37:09,610
Wait, can I get on top of here?

2733
02:37:10,450 --> 02:37:10,850
Alright.

2734
02:37:12,770 --> 02:37:14,250
Okay, that's dumb.

2735
02:37:16,210 --> 02:37:18,970
Like, the timer is still starting.

2736
02:37:24,810 --> 02:37:26,190
How do I lock it in?

2737
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:33,840
This is scary.

2738
02:37:35,180 --> 02:37:36,560
Rotation locked.

2739
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:40,040
Oh,

2740
02:37:44,490 --> 02:37:45,730
I'm scared.

2741
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:53,000
I don't know how to lock in.

2742
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:04,780
Oh, rotation locked.

2743
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:05,360
There we go.

2744
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:06,340
Whoa.

2745
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:31,630
Whoa.

2746
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:38,160
Guys, I want to know.

2747
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:40,140
Is it like, each points...

2748
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:43,140
Each point you get...

2749
02:38:47,400 --> 02:38:48,040
Uh...

2750
02:38:48,040 --> 02:38:48,960
Why are they running?

2751
02:38:49,380 --> 02:38:50,260
I can't tell.

2752
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:55,600
Each point you get is like...

2753
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:02,680
Each point you get per puzzle?

2754
02:39:02,680 --> 02:39:05,180
Or is it like...

2755
02:39:05,180 --> 02:39:08,060
You get points for completing all puzzles.

2756
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:10,860
Can you guys let me know that?

2757
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:13,740
Per puzzle?

2758
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:14,920
Or is it...

2759
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:16,860
Uh...

2760
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:18,600
All...

2761
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:19,020
Puzzles.

2762
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:19,820
Okay, yay?

2763
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:22,060
For per puzzle, you get points?

2764
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:22,840
Nay!

2765
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:25,860
For... You get points for all puzzles.

2766
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:32,970
Oh, per puzzle?

2767
02:39:33,130 --> 02:39:34,870
Oh, so it does benefit doing puzzles.

2768
02:39:35,170 --> 02:39:35,450
Okay.

2769
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:38,450
That's good to know.

2770
02:39:42,450 --> 02:39:44,750
Okay, we just have to find stuff then.

2771
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:49,170
Told you, some of these is like, so confusing.

2772
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:51,830
We're supposed to get two points per two minutes.

2773
02:39:51,930 --> 02:39:52,450
We live.

2774
02:40:03,100 --> 02:40:03,940
I don't know.

2775
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:07,240
Oh!

2776
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:08,020
Oh god.

2777
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:09,140
Oh god.

2778
02:40:09,660 --> 02:40:10,200
Oh god.

2779
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:23,240
I don't know where the puzzles are.

2780
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:25,940
It's scary!

2781
02:40:25,940 --> 02:40:28,260
Do I even get any points?

2782
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:31,500
Am I even getting anything?

2783
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:37,320
That's a lot of monsters.

2784
02:40:45,250 --> 02:40:46,990
I have to move soon.

2785
02:40:47,830 --> 02:40:49,630
Please bypass me soon.

2786
02:40:50,230 --> 02:40:51,190
Oh, he's lagging.

2787
02:40:51,430 --> 02:40:51,710
No!

2788
02:40:55,750 --> 02:40:56,550
No!

2789
02:40:57,410 --> 02:40:58,250
Did he... No!

2790
02:40:59,990 --> 02:41:02,630
He was lagging too!

2791
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:07,830
Wait, I survived longer for two minutes, right?

2792
02:41:08,390 --> 02:41:11,150
Wait, let me check the points again.

2793
02:41:11,930 --> 02:41:15,690
Okay, survived for five minutes.

2794
02:41:15,830 --> 02:41:16,250
No!

2795
02:41:16,390 --> 02:41:18,630
I didn't survive for five minutes!

2796
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:25,670
It was five minutes, not two!

2797
02:41:26,350 --> 02:41:28,370
I read it wrong!

2798
02:41:29,110 --> 02:41:32,090
It was five minutes, guys!

2799
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:36,750
It wasn't two!

2800
02:41:41,700 --> 02:41:42,380
Goodbye.

2801
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:46,680
I thought it said two minutes.

2802
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:47,300
Like, bro!

2803
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:48,620
Okay, two minutes.

2804
02:41:48,740 --> 02:41:50,700
It's like five paragraphs.

2805
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:51,980
Not even paragraphs.

2806
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:55,980
I swear, the rules are like a thousand words.

2807
02:41:56,660 --> 02:41:58,540
It's so hard to retain.

2808
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:01,600
Some of the information.

2809
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:05,460
Bro, how did he know?

2810
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:06,540
I locked it.

2811
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:09,000
I locked my rotation.

2812
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:14,480
Bro, okay, the worst part was he was lagging, so I got so confused.

2813
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:16,480
I was like, is he walking past me?

2814
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:22,000
I was like, is that man walking past me or is he trying to kill me?

2815
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:24,260
He's so... He's lagging.

2816
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:26,920
He's...

2817
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:30,940
Like, why are you lagging as the monster?

2818
02:42:33,180 --> 02:42:33,580
Sadge.

2819
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,660
Okay, so per puzzle, you can get five.

2820
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:38,100
You can get points.

2821
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:42,820
They made it seem like you have to complete all tasks.

2822
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:44,700
So I got confused with that rule.

2823
02:42:46,460 --> 02:42:46,860
Yay!

2824
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:48,860
Yay!

2825
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:51,400
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

2826
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:51,960
Let me in.

2827
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:55,820
Oh.

2828
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:57,760
Oh, that's why!

2829
02:42:57,940 --> 02:43:00,160
Wait, that's actually bullshit!

2830
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:05,060
It reveals a prop!

2831
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:07,540
So that... I didn't know that!

2832
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:10,960
We had no intel as to what they are.

2833
02:43:15,140 --> 02:43:18,620
Oh my god, that's why I was like wondering, how did they find out?

2834
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:20,300
Like, I was so confused.

2835
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:22,320
Like, how did they find out?

2836
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:25,440
I was... I was like a monster.

2837
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:30,460
Wait, how do we...

2838
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:33,140
Bro, what the heck?

2839
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:37,540
Here, press F to reveal.

2840
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:38,620
Okay.

2841
02:43:41,900 --> 02:43:44,200
Okay, I know like there's a lot of them.

2842
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:47,060
There are no prop... Yeah!

2843
02:43:47,380 --> 02:43:49,900
Oh my god, so that's how!

2844
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:52,640
That's actually messed up.

2845
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:56,560
If I knew a monster had that ability, I would not just sit there.

2846
02:44:00,860 --> 02:44:04,860
I would 100% not just sit there.

2847
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:07,280
That's actually so messed up.

2848
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:13,420
Oh my god, that's so smart.

2849
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:14,980
Jesus.

2850
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:17,320
Wait, I don't remember the skull being there.

2851
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:19,880
Actually, I don't remember in general.

2852
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:29,960
I don't remember what the props were.

2853
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:35,160
It's been so long already.

2854
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:35,860
I already forgot.

2855
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:39,680
Oh my god.

2856
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:41,520
Are they actually still there?

2857
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:42,920
Okay, they're not there then.

2858
02:44:43,380 --> 02:44:44,120
They're not there.

2859
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:45,940
There's only one prop remaining?

2860
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:47,480
Bro, what?

2861
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:52,520
Oh my god.

2862
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:55,620
Can't believe it.

2863
02:44:57,660 --> 02:45:03,740
This ability, the revealing prop ability was actually so messed up.

2864
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:06,140
It was so messed up.

2865
02:45:07,160 --> 02:45:12,120
No wonder he knew I was just there.

2866
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,400
Please wait.

2867
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:21,840
Who has the most points?

2868
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:23,200
Zero points?

2869
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:25,460
Oh hey, there's me.

2870
02:45:25,620 --> 02:45:26,340
Zero points.

2871
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:31,160
That's me.

2872
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:34,500
Wait, we all have zero points.

2873
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:36,640
Oh my god.

2874
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:40,200
Oh my god.

2875
02:45:42,020 --> 02:45:45,720
I feel like they should've told us what each hunter ability does.

2876
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:49,720
Because, like, if I knew that...

2877
02:45:50,760 --> 02:45:53,720
One of the hunters can literally see...

2878
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:59,970
Can literally see what the prop...

2879
02:46:00,540 --> 02:46:02,140
I would not have just stood there.

2880
02:46:02,420 --> 02:46:04,000
I would've ran away.

2881
02:46:08,620 --> 02:46:09,960
Oh my god.

2882
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:12,280
After seeing that, I'm like, what?

2883
02:46:13,480 --> 02:46:14,480
It's like, how?

2884
02:46:16,260 --> 02:46:18,720
I would've 100% just ran.

2885
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:23,540
Oh my god, might as well just be a goddamn prop.

2886
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:26,800
Being a hunter is just better.

2887
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:29,960
There's, like, no reason, I feel.

2888
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:32,740
There's actually no reason to be a prop.

2889
02:46:33,720 --> 02:46:36,660
If I was a hunter, I can just find people.

2890
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:40,000
Do puzzles or something.

2891
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:45,860
Let's all just be skulls.

2892
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:52,040
Just kill me now so I can find props.

2893
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:59,900
Just kill me now in games so I can be a hunter.

2894
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:02,480
It's just worth it.

2895
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:07,040
It's either do puzzles or...

2896
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:11,600
There's no stuff here.

2897
02:47:15,870 --> 02:47:17,910
Where are some of the tasks?

2898
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:22,030
Oh my god.

2899
02:47:23,350 --> 02:47:26,590
The thing is, I feel like we all wanna be hit by the hunter.

2900
02:47:28,570 --> 02:47:31,770
Like, the moment you get hunter, you just... It's like, free.

2901
02:47:32,330 --> 02:47:32,770
Reload.

2902
02:47:33,770 --> 02:47:34,210
IMO.

2903
02:47:36,130 --> 02:47:39,430
All of us is just trying to find, like, the puzzle stuff.

2904
02:47:41,230 --> 02:47:41,970
Wait, no!

2905
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:43,410
I wanna be there!

2906
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:45,690
I'm gonna die.

2907
02:47:46,390 --> 02:47:48,110
I rather... I don't know.

2908
02:47:48,850 --> 02:47:50,050
I rather just die.

2909
02:47:55,320 --> 02:47:56,320
There's no reason.

2910
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:58,340
Oh my god.

2911
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:00,480
I literally don't know where the puzzles are.

2912
02:48:01,180 --> 02:48:01,600
Hello?

2913
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:02,940
Puzzles?

2914
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:08,700
We're all just running around as headless chickens.

2915
02:48:11,260 --> 02:48:14,140
We're all, like, headless chickens right now.

2916
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:15,260
Just running around.

2917
02:48:15,420 --> 02:48:16,880
One is an actual chicken!

2918
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:20,840
One of them is even a chicken themselves!

2919
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:26,440
The eyes!

2920
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:30,560
Where are the goddamn eyes?!

2921
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:34,380
Bro, I've been moving for, like, 20 years.

2922
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:35,420
You cannot say that.

2923
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:38,620
Your location will be revealed.

2924
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:39,480
I know!

2925
02:48:39,580 --> 02:48:41,440
I've been running for 20 years!

2926
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:43,640
I know my location will be revealed!

2927
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:46,900
Yes!

2928
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:52,560
There's two out of three course paintings?!

2929
02:48:53,420 --> 02:48:54,160
I don't even

2930
02:48:58,020 --> 02:48:59,220
get— Oh, wait.

2931
02:49:03,030 --> 02:49:08,190
Oh my god, the fact that I don't even get that point automatically is the worst part.

2932
02:49:09,590 --> 02:49:09,870
No!

2933
02:49:10,370 --> 02:49:10,930
No!

2934
02:49:11,430 --> 02:49:13,670
Please hit the candle and not me!

2935
02:49:14,330 --> 02:49:14,990
Please!

2936
02:49:15,350 --> 02:49:16,110
The candle!

2937
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:19,010
Please!

2938
02:49:19,810 --> 02:49:20,550
The candle!

2939
02:49:21,250 --> 02:49:21,750
No!

2940
02:49:22,610 --> 02:49:24,930
I was so close!

2941
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:28,210
No!

2942
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:29,830
I got two!

2943
02:49:30,410 --> 02:49:33,350
I couldn't find the last painting!

2944
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:47,690
That was so close.

2945
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:50,130
I almost juked them, too.

2946
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:52,850
I almost juked them!

2947
02:49:54,610 --> 02:49:55,470
It's GG.

2948
02:49:55,830 --> 02:49:57,370
This game is hard.

2949
02:49:58,610 --> 02:50:03,750
I think it's really hard because, like, the puzzles are, like, so difficult.

2950
02:50:03,990 --> 02:50:08,290
And, like, when you're a hunter, you get more out of it as a hunter.

2951
02:50:08,770 --> 02:50:14,670
Like, it's so RNG to the fact that you get more points if you get RNG'd as a hunter.

2952
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:17,250
Versus, like, being an object.

2953
02:50:17,730 --> 02:50:20,770
So it's already, like, skewed towards RNG for hunters.

2954
02:50:21,430 --> 02:50:21,890
Yeah.

2955
02:50:22,270 --> 02:50:26,050
Whoever gets, like, good RNG for that, basically...

2956
02:50:26,050 --> 02:50:26,770
Gets points.

2957
02:50:27,930 --> 02:50:29,690
Because there's more props to kill, too.

2958
02:50:29,890 --> 02:50:31,890
There's a lot of props, too, running around.

2959
02:50:31,950 --> 02:50:33,230
And everybody's moving around.

2960
02:50:33,530 --> 02:50:35,370
Nobody wants to hide, I feel like.

2961
02:50:36,050 --> 02:50:37,710
Like, literally nobody wants to hide.

2962
02:50:37,850 --> 02:50:40,770
And then the fact that they have that power to...

2963
02:50:41,290 --> 02:50:42,110
See objects.

2964
02:50:42,470 --> 02:50:44,350
Like, literally see props.

2965
02:50:44,890 --> 02:50:46,090
Is, like, messed up.

2966
02:50:46,090 --> 02:50:49,670
I think this game definitely should've been balanced more.

2967
02:50:50,730 --> 02:50:55,510
This game definitely feels like it could... It needs a lot of balancing, I feel.

2968
02:50:57,630 --> 02:51:00,710
I think they should remove the monster that could literally see props.

2969
02:51:01,290 --> 02:51:03,450
Because, like, we already have to move.

2970
02:51:03,850 --> 02:51:06,750
I think, like, because, like, IMO, we already have to move anyway.

2971
02:51:07,150 --> 02:51:10,910
So there's no reason for a monster to be able to have, like, the sight to see props.

2972
02:51:11,230 --> 02:51:11,930
If we're moving.

2973
02:51:12,090 --> 02:51:14,110
If we have one minute to move.

2974
02:51:16,090 --> 02:51:17,730
Like, I know, like, the cooldown's really hard.

2975
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:18,950
Like, there's a huge cooldown.

2976
02:51:19,570 --> 02:51:20,950
But, like I said, we're already moving.

2977
02:51:21,250 --> 02:51:21,990
So it doesn't matter.

2978
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:24,230
Like, it's just better to be the Grinner.

2979
02:51:27,170 --> 02:51:28,170
It's just easier.

2980
02:51:29,210 --> 02:51:31,310
Oh, there's 13 props remaining.

2981
02:51:34,430 --> 02:51:38,090
I know you're all running, cuz you wanna do tasks.

2982
02:51:41,970 --> 02:51:43,550
Nobody's hiding anymore.

2983
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:44,510
I know that.

2984
02:51:44,510 --> 02:51:47,390
I know none of you guys like to hide.

2985
02:51:50,030 --> 02:51:52,630
I know that none of you guys like to hide.

2986
02:51:56,220 --> 02:51:57,260
Yeah, this has been...

2987
02:51:58,400 --> 02:51:58,920
Whoa!

2988
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:04,320
Wait, this room has... Wait, they don't change locations for rooms?

2989
02:52:09,970 --> 02:52:11,130
Wait a minute.

2990
02:52:12,550 --> 02:52:15,790
I feel like when you know what the puzzles are... Wait, that's not fair!

2991
02:52:16,170 --> 02:52:17,410
The puzzles aren't locked.

2992
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:19,030
I think.

2993
02:52:19,370 --> 02:52:21,630
I think, like, uh...

2994
02:52:21,630 --> 02:52:24,470
The puzzles aren't, like, locked to a specific location.

2995
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:28,390
I feel like, right?

2996
02:52:29,710 --> 02:52:31,810
Cuz, like, why would...

2997
02:52:34,190 --> 02:52:38,870
Yeah, so, like, I could just go there and unlock...

2998
02:52:38,870 --> 02:52:40,050
Wait, that's not fair!

2999
02:52:41,170 --> 02:52:43,490
We just, like, run... Yeah!

3000
02:52:43,490 --> 02:52:44,410
Okay, guys.

3001
02:52:44,470 --> 02:52:47,050
The worst part is that I am directionally challenged.

3002
02:52:47,390 --> 02:52:49,630
So I don't really remember where the paintings are.

3003
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:55,110
I guess we just gotta figure out where the paintings are again.

3004
02:52:55,790 --> 02:53:00,490
Cuz, like, if... The fact that the puzzles aren't locked specifically...

3005
02:53:01,370 --> 02:53:03,010
So, like, that's one of them.

3006
02:53:03,450 --> 02:53:04,450
Like, the intel.

3007
02:53:05,310 --> 02:53:07,070
This is the north rooms.

3008
02:53:08,190 --> 02:53:09,490
And I guess, like...

3009
02:53:10,890 --> 02:53:11,550
X...

3010
02:53:11,550 --> 02:53:12,650
Uh...

3011
02:53:13,330 --> 02:53:13,990
X...

3012
02:53:13,990 --> 02:53:14,850
X...

3013
02:53:14,850 --> 02:53:15,210
That?

3014
02:53:15,950 --> 02:53:17,550
Yeah, so that's north room.

3015
02:53:17,630 --> 02:53:18,750
So that's one of the puzzles.

3016
02:53:20,590 --> 02:53:22,110
Wait, that's not fair!

3017
02:53:24,990 --> 02:53:26,030
Wait a minute.

3018
02:53:26,670 --> 02:53:27,930
Why don't they rotate that?

3019
02:53:29,770 --> 02:53:31,190
They should at least...

3020
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:33,190
Randomize the location.

3021
02:53:36,190 --> 02:53:39,450
I feel like they should randomize the locations for this.

3022
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:41,430
Okay.

3023
02:53:43,650 --> 02:53:45,470
Where are the other paintings, though?

3024
02:53:48,430 --> 02:53:48,990
Uh...

3025
02:53:49,570 --> 02:53:52,410
I feel like people will know where the paintings are.

3026
02:53:52,650 --> 02:53:53,710
Better than me.

3027
02:53:54,250 --> 02:53:55,210
Cuz I found two.

3028
02:53:55,710 --> 02:53:56,930
But I don't know where the others are.

3029
02:53:57,610 --> 02:53:58,950
Where the other paintings are.

3030
02:54:00,850 --> 02:54:01,930
Oh my god.

3031
02:54:04,130 --> 02:54:05,710
Where's the last prop?

3032
02:54:05,950 --> 02:54:07,190
I didn't even get to see...

3033
02:54:07,190 --> 02:54:07,810
Okay, courtyard.

3034
02:54:08,790 --> 02:54:10,770
Courtyard takes us to this chest.

3035
02:54:11,970 --> 02:54:13,730
I only have one minute to run to here.

3036
02:54:14,910 --> 02:54:15,870
So, like...

3037
02:54:15,870 --> 02:54:18,790
Me completing one task should be okay.

3038
02:54:19,650 --> 02:54:20,430
Question mark.

3039
02:54:22,350 --> 02:54:26,070
I just need to go up the stairs for that.

3040
02:54:26,510 --> 02:54:29,370
Goddammit, I wish I could, like, have you guys backseat me right now.

3041
02:54:30,010 --> 02:54:31,350
My brain is already tired.

3042
02:54:33,610 --> 02:54:34,410
Like...

3043
02:54:34,410 --> 02:54:35,970
I'm already tired.

3044
02:54:37,170 --> 02:54:39,630
Trying to strategize.

3045
02:54:42,030 --> 02:54:43,370
One left.

3046
02:54:44,730 --> 02:54:46,530
Wherever they are.

3047
02:54:46,730 --> 02:54:47,990
I like the grass.

3048
02:54:51,670 --> 02:54:53,270
One left.

3049
02:54:53,350 --> 02:54:54,890
Oh my god, this guy might have 5 points.

3050
02:54:57,930 --> 02:54:59,470
This guy literally...

3051
02:54:59,470 --> 02:55:02,330
Goddammit, I know in this group of 80...

3052
02:55:02,330 --> 02:55:06,390
People have, like, photographic memory, so they remember where each prop is.

3053
02:55:06,570 --> 02:55:07,610
I can feel it.

3054
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:11,030
I can feel the photographic mem...

3055
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:11,490
Oh shit.

3056
02:55:12,190 --> 02:55:15,130
And I'm gonna hit that, but I have 0 points anyway, so it doesn't matter.

3057
02:55:17,470 --> 02:55:18,830
It doesn't matter.

3058
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:20,990
I already have 0 points anyway.

3059
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:24,330
There's me.

3060
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:26,470
There's me over there.

3061
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:28,590
Bro, people have 5 points?

3062
02:55:29,450 --> 02:55:30,550
Oh, it's the task...

3063
02:55:30,550 --> 02:55:31,430
It's the task!

3064
02:55:31,430 --> 02:55:32,910
That's what I'm saying!

3065
02:55:33,410 --> 02:55:35,710
They know where to go!

3066
02:55:37,090 --> 02:55:38,790
That's literally what I'm saying!

3067
02:55:38,910 --> 02:55:40,250
They know where to go!

3068
02:55:40,570 --> 02:55:42,850
Because none of the area is randomized!

3069
02:55:44,790 --> 02:55:46,430
So they literally are just...

3070
02:55:47,350 --> 02:55:49,650
They're literally just going to the same place.

3071
02:55:49,730 --> 02:55:52,810
I wonder if the chest stuff is randomized or not.

3072
02:55:54,290 --> 02:55:56,150
That's what I'm saying, guys!

3073
02:56:01,430 --> 02:56:03,550
Bro, people are hunters, man.

3074
02:56:04,930 --> 02:56:08,890
Literally a hunter can kill 5 people and they're safe.

3075
02:56:13,470 --> 02:56:15,230
They just need to kill 5.

3076
02:56:17,210 --> 02:56:18,030
Come on!

3077
02:56:18,150 --> 02:56:18,690
Hunter!

3078
02:56:18,910 --> 02:56:19,310
Hunter!

3079
02:56:20,130 --> 02:56:21,110
80 people!

3080
02:56:21,210 --> 02:56:22,010
Hunter RNG!

3081
02:56:22,150 --> 02:56:22,810
Let's go!

3082
02:56:23,470 --> 02:56:23,750
Oh

3083
02:56:29,240 --> 02:56:29,980
my...

3084
02:56:29,980 --> 02:56:31,680
Oh my god, where is the courtyard?

3085
02:56:34,100 --> 02:56:38,700
Guys, I don't remember where this stuff is.

3086
02:56:40,480 --> 02:56:41,980
Wait, a lot of people are going this way.

3087
02:56:42,120 --> 02:56:42,560
That's it!

3088
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:42,880
That's it!

3089
02:56:42,940 --> 02:56:43,320
That's it!

3090
02:56:43,900 --> 02:56:45,900
Follow the stones!

3091
02:56:51,990 --> 02:56:52,470
What?

3092
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:54,170
Oh, what?!

3093
02:56:56,170 --> 02:56:57,390
Okay, this is dumb.

3094
02:57:08,690 --> 02:57:10,510
Oh my god, please.

3095
02:57:13,510 --> 02:57:14,470
And then...

3096
02:57:14,470 --> 02:57:16,430
Are you goddamn kidding...

3097
02:57:16,430 --> 02:57:18,710
Please, for the love... Please, just kill me.

3098
02:57:18,850 --> 02:57:19,470
I don't care.

3099
02:57:20,270 --> 02:57:20,870
Just...

3100
02:57:20,870 --> 02:57:22,230
I can't.

3101
02:57:22,470 --> 02:57:23,410
I can't.

3102
02:57:23,430 --> 02:57:24,290
Just kill me.

3103
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:31,270
Just let me have this, guys.

3104
02:57:31,470 --> 02:57:32,110
I can't!

3105
02:57:32,150 --> 02:57:32,710
I can't!

3106
02:57:32,730 --> 02:57:34,090
I literally can't!

3107
02:57:34,690 --> 02:57:38,110
Let me have this, guys!

3108
02:57:38,290 --> 02:57:38,850
Please!

3109
02:57:40,250 --> 02:57:41,310
Just kill me!

3110
02:57:45,230 --> 02:57:46,230
I can't!

3111
02:57:46,270 --> 02:57:47,930
I can't even F5!

3112
02:57:52,250 --> 02:57:53,350
I can't see!

3113
02:57:57,460 --> 02:57:58,940
I literally...

3114
02:57:58,940 --> 02:58:01,060
I can't... Their body block is...

3115
02:58:01,060 --> 02:58:03,040
I can't even open it!

3116
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:03,980
Bro!

3117
02:58:05,460 --> 02:58:08,940
Bro, we're stuck in third person, so I couldn't even...

3118
02:58:08,940 --> 02:58:11,000
I couldn't even hit it!

3119
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:14,820
I wanted to go back to first person.

3120
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:16,660
I actually... I was like...

3121
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:17,320
I can't.

3122
02:58:17,360 --> 02:58:19,180
Just put me back in first person.

3123
02:58:19,360 --> 02:58:21,260
I can't do third POV.

3124
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:24,460
I can't do third POV.

3125
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:30,120
Oh my god.

3126
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:33,400
I cannot do third POV, man.

3127
02:58:33,460 --> 02:58:34,200
I can't.

3128
02:58:34,580 --> 02:58:36,540
It's actually terrible.

3129
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:40,380
Third POV is actually a crime.

3130
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:41,740
For a prop.

3131
02:58:46,570 --> 02:58:47,150
Oh my god.

3132
02:58:47,370 --> 02:58:49,610
I mean, that can't be the only prop left, right?

3133
02:58:51,970 --> 02:58:52,490
Nice.

3134
02:58:56,330 --> 02:58:57,870
Oh my god.

3135
02:58:58,010 --> 02:58:59,170
That five kill.

3136
02:58:59,270 --> 02:59:00,470
I told you it's better!

3137
02:59:02,910 --> 02:59:03,610
Wait, what?

3138
02:59:09,260 --> 02:59:09,780
Wait.

3139
02:59:10,500 --> 02:59:11,500
That's so dumb.

3140
02:59:20,170 --> 02:59:21,890
Can I have that five points, sir?

3141
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:23,770
Please?

3142
02:59:26,050 --> 02:59:26,810
Please?

3143
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:42,370
No, no, no, no.

3144
02:59:43,570 --> 02:59:44,710
Not fair!

3145
02:59:46,050 --> 02:59:46,650
No!

3146
02:59:46,990 --> 02:59:50,990
I have to wait for...

3147
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:52,110
It's not fair!

3148
02:59:52,330 --> 02:59:53,590
I had a cooldown!

3149
02:59:56,010 --> 02:59:57,470
Oh my god!

3150
02:59:57,890 --> 02:59:59,070
I had a cooldown!

3151
03:00:00,390 --> 03:00:02,290
That could've been my points!

3152
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:05,790
I'm sad.

3153
03:00:06,830 --> 03:00:08,350
I literally had a cooldown.

3154
03:00:09,430 --> 03:00:11,030
I literally had a cooldown.

3155
03:00:11,030 --> 03:00:11,630
I literally had a cooldown.

3156
03:00:12,350 --> 03:00:13,270
It's sad.

3157
03:00:18,370 --> 03:00:19,910
Oh my god.

3158
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:23,850
Cooldowns shouldn't be a thing.

3159
03:00:24,290 --> 03:00:24,850
I'm gonna say it.

3160
03:00:25,290 --> 03:00:26,870
The cooldowns should not be a thing.

3161
03:00:29,470 --> 03:00:30,690
Get rid of them!

3162
03:00:30,970 --> 03:00:32,570
Down with cooldowns!

3163
03:00:34,610 --> 03:00:36,370
Just a killing cooldown, though.

3164
03:00:36,370 --> 03:00:38,130
I don't care about the ability cooldown.

3165
03:00:38,810 --> 03:00:40,390
Down with the killing cooldown!

3166
03:00:42,290 --> 03:00:44,310
I'm not gonna do the chest anymore.

3167
03:00:44,570 --> 03:00:46,410
That chest actually messed me up.

3168
03:00:47,230 --> 03:00:48,710
That messed me up so much.

3169
03:00:50,850 --> 03:00:52,530
It made me so sad.

3170
03:00:54,290 --> 03:00:57,390
That would've been an easy ten points, too.

3171
03:00:57,490 --> 03:00:58,890
I think that made me so sad.

3172
03:00:59,550 --> 03:01:07,130
If all those monsters didn't block me, and I just needed to wait five more seconds, ten points.

3173
03:01:10,830 --> 03:01:12,150
Oh my god.

3174
03:01:14,590 --> 03:01:18,910
And then the monsters that body blocked me, so I couldn't even see anything.

3175
03:01:19,010 --> 03:01:19,570
What the?

3176
03:01:19,650 --> 03:01:20,530
Oh, that's the admin.

3177
03:01:21,170 --> 03:01:22,990
I was like, what was that?

3178
03:01:24,190 --> 03:01:26,770
At least not zero points, guys.

3179
03:01:27,010 --> 03:01:28,580
At least not zero points.

3180
03:01:32,090 --> 03:01:34,930
At least not zero points.

3181
03:01:34,930 --> 03:01:36,290
That's all that matters.

3182
03:01:41,330 --> 03:01:44,770
We made it to non-zero points.

3183
03:01:52,070 --> 03:01:55,830
I would definitely wish some of these were in the rules.

3184
03:01:59,030 --> 03:02:08,190
I know we already had a thousand words, but like, a thousand and five hundred, I don't mind if we went to a thousand five hundred.

3185
03:02:08,410 --> 03:02:09,790
I do not mind.

3186
03:02:12,950 --> 03:02:16,630
If I already read a thousand, I could read five hundred more.

3187
03:02:19,450 --> 03:02:22,530
I could definitely read five hundred more words.

3188
03:02:28,070 --> 03:02:30,150
Wait, there's so many of us!

3189
03:02:30,290 --> 03:02:31,510
Okay, okay.

3190
03:02:31,850 --> 03:02:33,150
Oh my god, wait.

3191
03:02:33,790 --> 03:02:35,570
This is so good.

3192
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:35,630
This is so good.

3193
03:02:37,530 --> 03:02:40,750
Oh my god, no wonder they couldn't kill us right off the bat.

3194
03:02:40,890 --> 03:02:43,390
I realized why they couldn't kill us right off the bat!

3195
03:02:46,470 --> 03:02:48,710
Oh, it makes sense now!

3196
03:02:53,140 --> 03:02:56,020
Why they couldn't kill us right off the bat?

3197
03:02:58,060 --> 03:02:59,320
Oh my god.

3198
03:02:59,740 --> 03:03:02,800
Everything makes so much more sense now.

3199
03:03:03,400 --> 03:03:04,640
Oh my god.

3200
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:05,500
Oh my god.

3201
03:03:05,620 --> 03:03:08,080
Oh, there's a bone right here.

3202
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:10,140
There's a bone right...

3203
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:10,620
Wait, what?

3204
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:12,700
What the heck?

3205
03:03:13,980 --> 03:03:15,640
Oh, that's not good.

3206
03:03:17,360 --> 03:03:19,360
Come on, come on, come on.

3207
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:20,840
Let me munch you.

3208
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:22,640
Let me munch you.

3209
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:25,360
Yes!

3210
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:26,960
Prop killed down.

3211
03:03:27,360 --> 03:03:27,780
Yay!

3212
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:29,680
Okay.

3213
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:32,100
Now to wait another minute.

3214
03:03:34,640 --> 03:03:37,040
Now to wait one minute.

3215
03:03:37,480 --> 03:03:37,540
Yeah.

3216
03:03:39,500 --> 03:03:41,060
I'll just...

3217
03:03:41,060 --> 03:03:42,820
Now to wait a minute.

3218
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:49,720
Now to wait 30 seconds.

3219
03:03:52,310 --> 03:03:52,700
Yay!

3220
03:03:53,660 --> 03:03:55,660
I'm gonna chase you down, sir.

3221
03:03:56,140 --> 03:03:57,560
Until it's over.

3222
03:03:58,280 --> 03:03:59,860
Until I nom you up.

3223
03:04:00,020 --> 03:04:01,320
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3224
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:03,480
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3225
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:04,980
Come on, 22 sec...

3226
03:04:04,980 --> 03:04:06,360
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3227
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:08,700
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3228
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:11,020
Come on, 15 seconds.

3229
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:12,340
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3230
03:04:13,740 --> 03:04:14,520
10 seconds.

3231
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:24,140
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3232
03:04:25,360 --> 03:04:26,680
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3233
03:04:28,920 --> 03:04:30,540
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3234
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:31,880
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3235
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:33,460
Time to nom you too.

3236
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:34,600
Nom, nom, nom.

3237
03:04:39,960 --> 03:04:41,120
Come on.

3238
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:43,160
You guys got this, guys.

3239
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,080
You guys got this.

3240
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:46,800
You know what?

3241
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:48,100
Fuck you.

3242
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:50,200
I got body blocked too.

3243
03:04:53,400 --> 03:04:55,860
I got body blocked too.

3244
03:04:57,400 --> 03:04:58,080
I got body blocked too.

3245
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,420
You don't get to have this.

3246
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:02,580
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3247
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:04,820
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3248
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:07,080
Wait, who nommed him?

3249
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:09,440
Wait, that was my nom.

3250
03:05:13,070 --> 03:05:15,410
That was my nom.

3251
03:05:15,970 --> 03:05:23,330
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3252
03:05:25,150 --> 03:05:25,830
Yes!

3253
03:05:26,270 --> 03:05:27,530
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3254
03:05:30,630 --> 03:05:33,530
That was my nom time.

3255
03:05:36,090 --> 03:05:38,090
It's my turn to nom.

3256
03:05:40,050 --> 03:05:42,050
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3257
03:05:44,170 --> 03:05:45,670
You don't get that.

3258
03:05:46,390 --> 03:05:46,990
You don't get that.

3259
03:05:47,910 --> 03:05:49,910
After all the pain I had to go through.

3260
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:52,610
You don't get that nom.

3261
03:05:53,670 --> 03:05:54,110
Oh, hey.

3262
03:05:54,650 --> 03:05:55,790
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3263
03:05:57,690 --> 03:05:58,930
Get back here.

3264
03:05:59,890 --> 03:06:01,330
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

3265
03:06:06,810 --> 03:06:07,290
Ow!

3266
03:06:08,130 --> 03:06:09,090
My nom!

3267
03:06:10,570 --> 03:06:11,690
Oh, you have cooldown.

3268
03:06:13,950 --> 03:06:15,090
You have a cooldown.

3269
03:06:16,610 --> 03:06:17,590
I steal that.

3270
03:06:17,670 --> 03:06:19,050
Like how you stole my cooldown.

3271
03:06:22,130 --> 03:06:23,870
No, I can't see.

3272
03:06:25,710 --> 03:06:27,330
Where did he go?

3273
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:32,380
Where did he go?

3274
03:06:42,500 --> 03:06:43,900
Wait, where did he go?

3275
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:47,960
No, my free nom!

3276
03:06:53,770 --> 03:06:54,430
What?

3277
03:06:55,570 --> 03:06:57,090
There's no way!

3278
03:06:57,930 --> 03:06:58,990
Okay, no.

3279
03:06:59,390 --> 03:06:59,890
No!

3280
03:07:00,330 --> 03:07:01,150
Are you serious?

3281
03:07:02,010 --> 03:07:04,050
Okay, I'm actually mad.

3282
03:07:04,050 --> 03:07:05,530
There's no way.

3283
03:07:06,150 --> 03:07:09,390
Like, I had so many points.

3284
03:07:10,250 --> 03:07:12,030
Because I nommed.

3285
03:07:13,650 --> 03:07:15,350
They're restarting it?

3286
03:07:15,870 --> 03:07:16,550
What?

3287
03:07:17,010 --> 03:07:19,050
Okay, that's actually not fair.

3288
03:07:19,550 --> 03:07:20,870
I actually don't like that.

3289
03:07:21,330 --> 03:07:24,390
I actually had the best round of my life.

3290
03:07:24,670 --> 03:07:26,390
And they're restarting it.

3291
03:07:28,130 --> 03:07:29,730
Oh my god.

3292
03:07:30,750 --> 03:07:32,250
That made me sad.

3293
03:07:32,250 --> 03:07:33,710
That actually made me sad.

3294
03:07:35,710 --> 03:07:37,670
I feel like they should just commit to it.

3295
03:07:38,070 --> 03:07:40,130
There's no... they should just commit to it.

3296
03:07:42,790 --> 03:07:43,750
Like, honestly.

3297
03:07:44,370 --> 03:07:46,250
There's no reason to keep...

3298
03:07:48,150 --> 03:07:49,790
Because like, everybody...

3299
03:07:49,790 --> 03:07:51,590
Because it's RNG for the hunters.

3300
03:07:52,530 --> 03:07:54,750
Literally, whoever gets hunters wins.

3301
03:07:56,010 --> 03:07:58,410
So it's like, I don't feel like they should just...

3302
03:07:58,410 --> 03:07:59,530
They should rerun it.

3303
03:07:59,530 --> 03:08:03,130
Because the people who got hunters last time...

3304
03:08:03,130 --> 03:08:05,330
There's no guarantee they're gonna get hunters again.

3305
03:08:06,390 --> 03:08:08,170
So you might as well just commit to it.

3306
03:08:09,030 --> 03:08:12,070
Because they didn't restart the other games when it wasn't fair.

3307
03:08:13,770 --> 03:08:16,310
I know a lot of people complain about this game.

3308
03:08:16,410 --> 03:08:18,130
Because this game was actually messed up.

3309
03:08:20,150 --> 03:08:22,570
But I feel like they should've committed.

3310
03:08:23,770 --> 03:08:24,890
Because it took like...

3311
03:08:24,890 --> 03:08:27,930
We had a 40 minute delay to set this game up too.

3312
03:08:29,050 --> 03:08:29,850
And then...

3313
03:08:29,850 --> 03:08:32,310
Like, we already committed 4 rounds to it.

3314
03:08:33,010 --> 03:08:35,210
Like, 4 rounds has been committed already.

3315
03:08:37,090 --> 03:08:39,670
I don't even know if I made it in too.

3316
03:08:39,930 --> 03:08:41,530
Like, I don't know if I made it in.

3317
03:08:41,570 --> 03:08:43,290
I just feel like, you know...

3318
03:08:43,290 --> 03:08:45,170
We already committed 4 rounds of this.

3319
03:08:45,210 --> 03:08:47,990
We might as well just commit to the full...

3320
03:08:47,990 --> 03:08:49,230
Just keep going.

3321
03:08:49,430 --> 03:08:49,830
You know?

3322
03:08:51,150 --> 03:08:52,830
At that point, we should just keep going.

3323
03:08:59,210 --> 03:09:02,070
I got the hunted too.

3324
03:09:02,290 --> 03:09:04,470
And I nom nom nom nom.

3325
03:09:05,270 --> 03:09:07,050
I nom nom nom nom.

3326
03:09:09,630 --> 03:09:11,790
I worked so hard.

3327
03:09:12,610 --> 03:09:14,270
I nom nom nom nom.

3328
03:09:15,910 --> 03:09:19,070
And I don't get to keep my points.

3329
03:09:20,630 --> 03:09:21,830
Oh, I get eliminated anyway.

3330
03:09:22,030 --> 03:09:22,890
Like, with the...

3331
03:09:22,890 --> 03:09:24,150
It doesn't matter.

3332
03:09:24,150 --> 03:09:25,310
I already got eliminated.

3333
03:09:25,390 --> 03:09:25,970
Wait, no?

3334
03:09:26,470 --> 03:09:27,450
Wait, I don't.

3335
03:09:27,690 --> 03:09:28,650
Oh no, I do.

3336
03:09:28,730 --> 03:09:29,270
I'm 24.

3337
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:31,010
I got eliminated anyway!

3338
03:09:33,410 --> 03:09:35,350
And I still said...

3339
03:09:35,350 --> 03:09:36,430
Keep it.

3340
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:48,160
People are now complaining.

3341
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:49,580
Because...

3342
03:09:49,580 --> 03:09:51,360
People are like...

3343
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:53,900
Some people kept going.

3344
03:09:54,380 --> 03:09:56,360
Like, some people actually stopped playing.

3345
03:09:56,360 --> 03:09:58,340
Because they said they were gonna rerun it.

3346
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:00,280
So people are mad.

3347
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:02,380
Cause like, now they are in a lose-lose...

3348
03:10:02,380 --> 03:10:03,780
Situation now.

3349
03:10:04,240 --> 03:10:05,720
They're in a lose-lose situation.

3350
03:10:06,060 --> 03:10:08,000
Because they said, like, keep it.

3351
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:10,060
But because if they kept it...

3352
03:10:10,060 --> 03:10:12,480
A lot of people actually...

3353
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:16,000
Like...

3354
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,360
Because like...

3355
03:10:22,040 --> 03:10:23,920
Wait, are we keeping it?

3356
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:24,700
I'm eliminated.

3357
03:10:27,580 --> 03:10:29,920
Oh, apparently the chest...

3358
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:33,320
The chest was broken.

3359
03:10:33,640 --> 03:10:34,520
Remember that chest?

3360
03:10:35,080 --> 03:10:37,700
Cause I don't even know are we eliminated or not!

3361
03:10:41,080 --> 03:10:42,800
Apparently, you know that chest?

3362
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:45,680
Where I was like, what the heck is this chest?

3363
03:10:46,060 --> 03:10:46,460
You know?

3364
03:10:47,940 --> 03:10:49,780
I was like, what the heck is that chest?

3365
03:10:49,980 --> 03:10:51,340
That chest was broken!

3366
03:10:51,340 --> 03:10:52,600
For everybody!

3367
03:10:53,300 --> 03:10:56,000
Nobody was able to open that chest!

3368
03:10:56,400 --> 03:10:58,260
I'm reading the general!

3369
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:01,960
Nobody...

3370
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:05,180
Was able to read that.

3371
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:08,460
Nobody was able to open that chest.

3372
03:11:17,080 --> 03:11:18,360
Oh my god.

3373
03:11:21,400 --> 03:11:22,820
Oh my god.

3374
03:11:23,380 --> 03:11:24,520
People are mad.

3375
03:11:24,900 --> 03:11:26,680
People are so mad.

3376
03:11:27,460 --> 03:11:29,940
Yeah, there's some crucial info not to be given.

3377
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:32,760
Yeah, people are complaining about the fact that...

3378
03:11:33,780 --> 03:11:34,220
Hello?

3379
03:11:34,760 --> 03:11:37,160
Oh my god, people are so angry right now.

3380
03:11:39,100 --> 03:11:42,120
I'll be honest, I was really annoyed throughout the game.

3381
03:11:42,200 --> 03:11:43,900
I just did not give a fuck at some point.

3382
03:11:44,080 --> 03:11:44,920
Yeah, I was like...

3383
03:11:44,920 --> 03:11:46,360
I was complaining cause like...

3384
03:11:46,360 --> 03:11:47,020
I didn't know...

3385
03:11:47,020 --> 03:11:48,460
They told us the hunter abilities...

3386
03:11:48,460 --> 03:11:51,080
That one of them can literally see the prop.

3387
03:11:52,620 --> 03:11:54,020
So what's the point of hiding?

3388
03:11:54,640 --> 03:11:56,600
They have the ability to see a prop!

3389
03:11:57,740 --> 03:11:58,620
And I didn't know!

3390
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:02,620
Yeah, but when you start out, you don't know.

3391
03:12:03,280 --> 03:12:04,580
So I stood still.

3392
03:12:04,680 --> 03:12:06,400
Cause I was like, oh okay, I have like 50 seconds.

3393
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:08,140
And there was like 3 hunters around me.

3394
03:12:08,660 --> 03:12:11,460
And then one of them just walked up to me and killed me.

3395
03:12:11,560 --> 03:12:12,440
So I was so confused.

3396
03:12:12,580 --> 03:12:13,320
I was like, what the heck?

3397
03:12:13,320 --> 03:12:15,080
And then I looked at the hunter abilities and I was like...

3398
03:12:15,080 --> 03:12:18,480
Oh, if I knew that that specific monster can see props...

3399
03:12:18,480 --> 03:12:19,580
I wouldn't have stood still.

3400
03:12:20,080 --> 03:12:21,560
I would have been like...

3401
03:12:21,560 --> 03:12:22,300
What the heck?

3402
03:12:23,500 --> 03:12:25,700
It feels very...

3403
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,960
It's hunter-sided.

3404
03:12:27,540 --> 03:12:28,280
It's very...

3405
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:29,820
It's overly hunter-sided.

3406
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:32,060
Yeah, no, 100%.

3407
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:34,440
Um...

3408
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:36,160
I don't know, I...

3409
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:39,940
And like, the puzzles were all the same area.

3410
03:12:40,900 --> 03:12:42,920
Yeah, so hunters knew where to camp.

3411
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:44,940
I saw like 5 different people camping.

3412
03:12:45,060 --> 03:12:45,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3413
03:12:46,600 --> 03:12:48,960
Like, I had a key and they were camping the chest.

3414
03:12:49,080 --> 03:12:50,240
Like, it was just Jover for me.

3415
03:12:50,560 --> 03:12:52,240
Yeah, like, it was just no point.

3416
03:12:52,500 --> 03:12:54,060
Like, cause it was all just like...

3417
03:12:54,460 --> 03:12:54,800
There.

3418
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:57,360
I feel like at that point...

3419
03:12:57,880 --> 03:13:00,320
Someone was like, you guys are a crime because you don't wanna die.

3420
03:13:00,380 --> 03:13:02,340
No, because it was bullshit.

3421
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:04,140
Wait, is that...

3422
03:13:04,140 --> 03:13:05,860
Guess who complained about that?

3423
03:13:05,860 --> 03:13:06,480
You see that?

3424
03:13:07,320 --> 03:13:07,800
What?

3425
03:13:08,240 --> 03:13:08,720
Sap.

3426
03:13:10,880 --> 03:13:12,680
Wait, but Sap got eliminated.

3427
03:13:14,100 --> 03:13:15,940
Yeah, but he's like...

3428
03:13:15,940 --> 03:13:16,780
He's a millionaire.

3429
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:20,080
Yeah, but then right after that...

3430
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:22,580
He was like, that was the worst game I've ever played.

3431
03:13:23,680 --> 03:13:24,880
Like, I don't...

3432
03:13:24,880 --> 03:13:26,940
If they run back any other game...

3433
03:13:26,940 --> 03:13:28,420
I think it'd be fine, rather than re-running.

3434
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:30,380
Yeah, I feel like it was just...

3435
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:32,480
I was annoyed, I was actually...

3436
03:13:32,480 --> 03:13:34,080
I feel like...

3437
03:13:34,080 --> 03:13:36,120
The rules for the hunter...

3438
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:38,740
The hunter abilities should've been given to us.

3439
03:13:38,800 --> 03:13:41,680
If they already wrote a thousand words for rules...

3440
03:13:41,680 --> 03:13:41,900
Um...

3441
03:13:41,900 --> 03:13:45,140
They kinda did give us the hunter's abilities in the video.

3442
03:13:45,980 --> 03:13:46,460
But...

3443
03:13:46,460 --> 03:13:47,460
Not really.

3444
03:13:48,060 --> 03:13:49,620
It wasn't told to us.

3445
03:13:50,320 --> 03:13:51,420
Uh, they did, they did.

3446
03:13:51,720 --> 03:13:52,200
They did?

3447
03:13:52,240 --> 03:13:55,900
They said the red one changes into a prop, the black one...

3448
03:13:55,900 --> 03:13:58,280
The black eyeball one changes into a...

3449
03:13:58,280 --> 03:13:59,860
No, the red one can see props.

3450
03:14:00,820 --> 03:14:01,960
No, there's two red ones.

3451
03:14:01,960 --> 03:14:02,340
Oh!

3452
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:05,820
The red dinosaur one has...

3453
03:14:05,820 --> 03:14:08,420
Can reveal props for a bit to itself.

3454
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:09,580
I didn't...

3455
03:14:09,580 --> 03:14:10,700
I didn't register that.

3456
03:14:11,100 --> 03:14:14,300
Cause people were talking too, so I didn't register it quite well.

3457
03:14:15,220 --> 03:14:15,660
Yeah...

3458
03:14:15,660 --> 03:14:16,780
I was really annoyed when people were...

3459
03:14:16,780 --> 03:14:19,360
Yeah, it's just... I don't know, I feel like...

3460
03:14:19,360 --> 03:14:21,740
And then the fact that they were saying we're gonna re-run it...

3461
03:14:21,740 --> 03:14:23,960
And then, like, people actually stopped playing...

3462
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:27,320
Was like...

3463
03:14:27,320 --> 03:14:29,640
And like, apparently a couple people, like...

3464
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:30,800
Stopped...

3465
03:14:30,800 --> 03:14:33,160
A couple people actually...

3466
03:14:33,160 --> 03:14:35,060
Stopped playing...

3467
03:14:35,060 --> 03:14:37,640
And got eliminated because they heard it was gonna be re-run.

3468
03:14:45,220 --> 03:14:46,020
Holy shit!

3469
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:47,020
Sap is angry!

3470
03:14:50,060 --> 03:14:52,680
Running a different game is not an option.

3471
03:14:53,240 --> 03:14:54,260
Don't eliminate anyone.

3472
03:14:54,380 --> 03:14:55,720
Just do more limbs for other games.

3473
03:14:55,940 --> 03:14:56,520
That game was shit.

3474
03:14:56,640 --> 03:14:57,880
You know what?

3475
03:14:57,940 --> 03:14:58,760
Sap's on our side.

3476
03:15:00,040 --> 03:15:01,380
Sap's on our side.

3477
03:15:02,700 --> 03:15:04,320
Oh my god...

3478
03:15:04,320 --> 03:15:06,320
So they're not running any other games...

3479
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:08,360
And they want to re-run that same game...

3480
03:15:08,360 --> 03:15:08,800
Dude...

3481
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:11,700
Running the same game doesn't change anything.

3482
03:15:11,780 --> 03:15:13,260
It's so hunter-sided.

3483
03:15:13,440 --> 03:15:14,180
It's just hunter-sided.

3484
03:15:14,380 --> 03:15:15,460
I got hunter too!

3485
03:15:15,720 --> 03:15:16,440
I got hunter.

3486
03:15:17,200 --> 03:15:19,040
I saw you catch up in points.

3487
03:15:19,240 --> 03:15:21,820
Yeah, I literally caught up because I got, like...

3488
03:15:21,820 --> 03:15:23,000
Four kills.

3489
03:15:24,300 --> 03:15:25,240
And the thing is...

3490
03:15:25,240 --> 03:15:26,980
I tried to get killed early...

3491
03:15:26,980 --> 03:15:29,420
And there were just fuckers dancing around with props.

3492
03:15:29,420 --> 03:15:30,620
Because, like...

3493
03:15:30,620 --> 03:15:32,720
Why would you kill a prop if you're ahead?

3494
03:15:32,800 --> 03:15:35,320
And like, you don't...

3495
03:15:35,320 --> 03:15:37,520
If you kill them, it's like less props for you.

3496
03:15:37,820 --> 03:15:38,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3497
03:15:38,640 --> 03:15:40,460
So they were camping other props too.

3498
03:15:41,220 --> 03:15:43,580
I saw like three people just...

3499
03:15:43,580 --> 03:15:45,120
Running around with props for fun.

3500
03:15:45,540 --> 03:15:45,900
Yeah.

3501
03:15:47,840 --> 03:15:48,960
It's actually...

3502
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:50,420
I feel like...

3503
03:15:50,420 --> 03:15:52,840
That one was actually...

3504
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:55,880
That one was actually messed up.

3505
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:57,820
I feel like...

3506
03:15:57,820 --> 03:15:58,820
Oh, yeah.

3507
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:00,860
And the thing is, there's so many.

3508
03:16:00,960 --> 03:16:02,160
There's 80 of us too.

3509
03:16:02,680 --> 03:16:04,260
So, like, the fact that there's like...

3510
03:16:04,260 --> 03:16:05,800
80 of us...

3511
03:16:06,340 --> 03:16:08,280
There's gonna be a lot of complaining.

3512
03:16:11,020 --> 03:16:11,900
No, like...

3513
03:16:11,900 --> 03:16:13,400
Once the event ended...

3514
03:16:13,400 --> 03:16:15,520
Or the round ended and we got eliminated...

3515
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:18,100
I saw the general chat move like 20 messages.

3516
03:16:18,120 --> 03:16:19,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3517
03:16:19,580 --> 03:16:22,160
It's just like...

3518
03:16:23,260 --> 03:16:24,820
I was looking and I was like...

3519
03:16:24,820 --> 03:16:26,140
Oh, my God!

3520
03:16:26,880 --> 03:16:28,320
It's so fast!

3521
03:16:30,680 --> 03:16:32,160
Nobody is happy!

3522
03:16:35,860 --> 03:16:37,400
Damn, I'm just hopping on Valorant.

3523
03:16:37,540 --> 03:16:37,960
Oh, my God.

3524
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,020
Wait, was the chest broken?

3525
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:41,280
Because, like, people were complaining that the...

3526
03:16:41,280 --> 03:16:42,180
Yo, I was...

3527
03:16:42,180 --> 03:16:44,420
My chat was laughing at me because I was like...

3528
03:16:44,420 --> 03:16:46,420
Why can't I open the chest?

3529
03:16:47,340 --> 03:16:49,580
And then people were laughing at me.

3530
03:16:49,820 --> 03:16:52,120
I didn't realize the chest was broken.

3531
03:16:53,540 --> 03:16:54,760
I just gave up.

3532
03:16:54,840 --> 03:16:55,560
No, the chest was broken.

3533
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:57,040
You can't click the middle part.

3534
03:16:57,420 --> 03:16:59,040
I just gave up.

3535
03:16:59,200 --> 03:16:59,480
Yeah!

3536
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:00,980
That was it!

3537
03:17:01,140 --> 03:17:02,440
I couldn't click the middle part!

3538
03:17:02,620 --> 03:17:03,780
I was so confused.

3539
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:05,980
I thought I was being stupid.

3540
03:17:06,360 --> 03:17:08,100
I was like, why can't I click the middle part?

3541
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:09,340
I'm so confused.

3542
03:17:10,480 --> 03:17:12,380
My chat was laughing at me.

3543
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:14,940
I thought it was me.

3544
03:17:15,080 --> 03:17:16,180
But it's not me.

3545
03:17:17,060 --> 03:17:18,520
It wasn't me.

3546
03:17:22,260 --> 03:17:25,280
Dude, someone just said, Just give 1000 to everyone.

3547
03:17:26,800 --> 03:17:28,380
Bro, okay.

3548
03:17:29,260 --> 03:17:30,520
I agree.

3549
03:17:31,580 --> 03:17:33,160
I agree.

3550
03:17:33,720 --> 03:17:34,240
I agree.

3551
03:17:34,520 --> 03:17:36,620
1k for everyone.

3552
03:17:41,780 --> 03:17:45,740
1k for getting to top 80.

3553
03:17:53,220 --> 03:17:54,860
Minecrafters don't need 70k.

3554
03:18:00,520 --> 03:18:02,080
That shit was so annoying.

3555
03:18:02,280 --> 03:18:06,220
I think I went fucking non-verbal.

3556
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:08,600
Because I was just so annoyed that I was getting cammed.

3557
03:18:08,800 --> 03:18:10,420
Or like, this and that were happening.

3558
03:18:11,520 --> 03:18:12,860
I kind of just went it out.

3559
03:18:14,160 --> 03:18:16,300
And the fact that it's like 80 people.

3560
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:18,320
80 people.

3561
03:18:20,380 --> 03:18:22,280
Like, 8 people gets to be hunter.

3562
03:18:22,420 --> 03:18:24,380
But there's not enough hunter spots for everybody.

3563
03:18:28,230 --> 03:18:29,710
I'm turning off emote only for now.

3564
03:18:29,990 --> 03:18:30,650
Yeah, me too.

3565
03:18:31,730 --> 03:18:33,490
How do you turn off emote only?

3566
03:18:33,590 --> 03:18:34,690
I don't know if my mod is still awake.

3567
03:18:35,450 --> 03:18:37,470
Oh my god, am I modding your channel?

3568
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:39,170
I know I am, nevermind.

3569
03:18:39,790 --> 03:18:40,830
You are, you should be.

3570
03:18:41,310 --> 03:18:42,870
Let me check.

3571
03:18:43,190 --> 03:18:44,790
Oh no, my moderator is still awake.

3572
03:18:44,790 --> 03:18:45,750
Moderator, can you?

3573
03:18:45,850 --> 03:18:47,030
Oh nice, thank you mod.

3574
03:18:47,810 --> 03:18:48,890
Alright guys, now you can yell.

3575
03:18:49,130 --> 03:18:51,070
It was awful, I know it was awful.

3576
03:18:51,130 --> 03:18:52,290
You guys can yell now.

3577
03:18:53,650 --> 03:18:55,730
That shit was so fucking bad.

3578
03:18:56,790 --> 03:18:57,150
Yeah.

3579
03:18:59,650 --> 03:19:02,790
Like, I understand the inherent like...

3580
03:19:03,430 --> 03:19:04,650
The way they wanted to do it.

3581
03:19:04,930 --> 03:19:07,210
I thought they would at least split lobbies or something.

3582
03:19:07,910 --> 03:19:08,270
Yeah.

3583
03:19:08,550 --> 03:19:10,050
If they split lobbies, that would make sense.

3584
03:19:10,310 --> 03:19:11,470
No, and it took like...

3585
03:19:11,470 --> 03:19:13,430
It took like 40 minutes of prep time.

3586
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:19,640
It took like literally 40 minutes of prep time.

3587
03:19:19,720 --> 03:19:21,220
Just for it to not be...

3588
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:27,000
There was a cooldown of 1 minute for the hunters.

3589
03:19:29,060 --> 03:19:29,860
Yeah, there was.

3590
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:32,000
Hunters get like a 1 minute cooldown.

3591
03:19:32,240 --> 03:19:34,660
But if you start as hunter, I literally got like...

3592
03:19:34,660 --> 03:19:36,760
20 points with the cooldowns.

3593
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:38,680
Yeah, cause like...

3594
03:19:38,680 --> 03:19:42,240
Once you start as hunter, everyone is literally running around trying to do tasks.

3595
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:44,140
Also, they didn't like...

3596
03:19:44,140 --> 03:19:44,540
So it's so easy.

3597
03:19:44,620 --> 03:19:45,960
I get killed like right off the bat.

3598
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:49,140
And I couldn't tell if you could redo the same task.

3599
03:19:49,240 --> 03:19:51,460
If I knew that, I would've stayed at the same task.

3600
03:19:51,540 --> 03:19:52,140
Wait, you can?

3601
03:19:53,020 --> 03:19:54,600
Yeah, it seems like...

3602
03:19:54,600 --> 03:19:56,060
The tasks reset each round.

3603
03:19:59,380 --> 03:19:59,780
Yeah.

3604
03:20:02,040 --> 03:20:06,180
If they're not gonna randomize the location, make there be like a barrier so the hunters can't camp it.

3605
03:20:06,600 --> 03:20:08,420
Yeah, I think so.

3606
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:14,860
Like, if they make a barrier around a task, At least it like, lets a prop get some points when they're camping that shit.

3607
03:20:15,480 --> 03:20:18,960
Cause like, on the very first round, I got the key for the chest.

3608
03:20:19,220 --> 03:20:20,820
And there was just a hunter standing on it right away.

3609
03:20:21,060 --> 03:20:21,760
Like, I couldn't do nothing.

3610
03:20:21,880 --> 03:20:24,100
And then I got chased by another hunter cause they saw I had the key.

3611
03:20:24,780 --> 03:20:25,080
Yeah.

3612
03:20:25,900 --> 03:20:28,720
And then, it's just the fact that like...

3613
03:20:28,720 --> 03:20:31,240
The puzzles didn't rotate.

3614
03:20:31,380 --> 03:20:34,240
And people were just doing the same task over and over again.

3615
03:20:34,900 --> 03:20:37,140
And they just had like a pathway too.

3616
03:20:37,280 --> 03:20:37,880
Like a path...

3617
03:20:37,880 --> 03:20:39,100
If the puzzles...

3618
03:20:39,100 --> 03:20:41,980
Like, if the puzzles themselves randomized, it would've been more fair.

3619
03:20:42,080 --> 03:20:43,660
Because people don't have like a set pathway.

3620
03:20:46,100 --> 03:20:50,340
And the fact that they decided that at the very last game, that it's not working.

3621
03:20:50,840 --> 03:20:54,180
And then they said it in the middle of the game for everybody.

3622
03:20:54,600 --> 03:20:55,800
It's what was messed up.

3623
03:20:55,840 --> 03:20:57,680
They should've just like, said it in the first round.

3624
03:20:58,800 --> 03:20:59,480
If they didn't...

3625
03:20:59,480 --> 03:21:01,400
If they did not say like, we should reset.

3626
03:21:01,620 --> 03:21:03,160
Then like, people would've been fine.

3627
03:21:03,240 --> 03:21:05,000
But the fact that they said, we should reset.

3628
03:21:06,520 --> 03:21:07,120
And...

3629
03:21:09,020 --> 03:21:09,620
Um...

3630
03:21:09,620 --> 03:21:10,800
Then like...

3631
03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:12,140
Then they would've been...

3632
03:21:12,140 --> 03:21:15,320
Everybody would've been more agreeable with the elimination.

3633
03:21:16,700 --> 03:21:19,260
But yeah, a couple of the tasks were definitely broken.

3634
03:21:19,420 --> 03:21:19,660
Yeah.

3635
03:21:21,060 --> 03:21:23,040
I didn't even realize certain...

3636
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:25,440
I didn't even know certain items had certain abilities.

3637
03:21:29,800 --> 03:21:30,880
Oh my God.

3638
03:21:30,980 --> 03:21:31,380
Whoa.

3639
03:21:31,380 --> 03:21:31,560
Whoa.

3640
03:21:38,830 --> 03:21:39,350
Yeah.

3641
03:21:39,610 --> 03:21:41,770
Apparently, some people didn't get Hunter and they're mad.

3642
03:21:42,110 --> 03:21:44,830
Because like, they couldn't make it.

3643
03:21:45,310 --> 03:21:46,050
Just rerun the...

3644
03:21:46,050 --> 03:21:48,550
I don't wanna rerun the dog game, man.

3645
03:21:50,250 --> 03:21:53,850
The admins literally said they can't rerun any of the past ones.

3646
03:21:54,730 --> 03:21:57,730
I don't understand why they couldn't rerun any of the past ones though.

3647
03:22:01,250 --> 03:22:01,990
I don't know.

3648
03:22:02,730 --> 03:22:04,350
Okay, let's make our own Twitch rivals.

3649
03:22:04,710 --> 03:22:04,990
Yeah.

3650
03:22:04,990 --> 03:22:08,070
You know, they actually offered for me to...

3651
03:22:08,070 --> 03:22:09,010
Why did you say yes?

3652
03:22:09,550 --> 03:22:09,990
What?

3653
03:22:11,070 --> 03:22:11,930
Did you say yes?

3654
03:22:13,430 --> 03:22:14,430
Is it bad?

3655
03:22:15,530 --> 03:22:16,690
No, I'm asking.

3656
03:22:16,910 --> 03:22:18,130
Did you say yes?

3657
03:22:19,730 --> 03:22:21,090
Well, we're still...

3658
03:22:21,830 --> 03:22:23,490
I don't know any other details.

3659
03:22:23,630 --> 03:22:25,870
They just asked me if I wanna do a Twitch rival.

3660
03:22:26,190 --> 03:22:26,970
If you wanted to?

3661
03:22:27,270 --> 03:22:28,650
I thought it'd be cool.

3662
03:22:29,510 --> 03:22:30,270
I'm asking.

3663
03:22:30,350 --> 03:22:31,110
Did you say yes?

3664
03:22:31,190 --> 03:22:32,010
I don't...

3665
03:22:32,010 --> 03:22:32,890
Did you say yes?

3666
03:22:33,490 --> 03:22:36,550
If you say yes, code a good one at least.

3667
03:22:36,710 --> 03:22:37,770
Make sure it's a good one.

3668
03:22:38,150 --> 03:22:38,670
Yeah.

3669
03:22:39,210 --> 03:22:42,150
Oh yeah, because like your reputation gets hit for...

3670
03:22:42,990 --> 03:22:44,550
For having a bad one.

3671
03:22:44,990 --> 03:22:46,430
And it's not even your fault.

3672
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:47,690
Not necessarily.

3673
03:22:48,730 --> 03:22:51,030
Well, they will say like...

3674
03:22:51,030 --> 03:22:52,090
Oh, remember that...

3675
03:22:53,050 --> 03:22:54,730
HennaXXRose Twitch rivals that happened?

3676
03:22:54,990 --> 03:22:56,050
That one was shit.

3677
03:22:56,270 --> 03:22:56,550
Wait.

3678
03:22:56,630 --> 03:22:57,990
It will be tied to your name.

3679
03:22:57,990 --> 03:22:59,050
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3680
03:23:00,550 --> 03:23:01,790
Yeah, that's why.

3681
03:23:02,770 --> 03:23:03,250
That's why.

3682
03:23:03,430 --> 03:23:05,810
That's why it's like risky.

3683
03:23:27,570 --> 03:23:29,370
Oh my God.

3684
03:23:30,350 --> 03:23:31,290
There's no winning.

3685
03:23:31,850 --> 03:23:33,590
There's actually no winning.

3686
03:23:36,810 --> 03:23:37,970
They're just talking.

3687
03:23:40,830 --> 03:23:41,710
Honestly, like...

3688
03:23:41,710 --> 03:23:44,690
Elimination or not, I kind of don't give a fuck at this point.

3689
03:23:45,170 --> 03:23:46,270
I think like...

3690
03:23:47,390 --> 03:23:48,430
I like how people are like...

3691
03:23:48,430 --> 03:23:50,710
I got propped four times and made it.

3692
03:23:51,990 --> 03:23:53,770
And then, they're like...

3693
03:23:53,770 --> 03:23:55,990
Well, to be fair, they are full on Minecraft players.

3694
03:23:56,110 --> 03:23:57,310
So they know how to...

3695
03:23:57,310 --> 03:23:59,030
They have like set routes and stuff.

3696
03:23:59,690 --> 03:24:01,590
I'm too stupid for set routes, man.

3697
03:24:01,770 --> 03:24:03,350
I don't know what I'm doing.

3698
03:24:03,350 --> 03:24:05,670
I don't remember where the things are.

3699
03:24:18,930 --> 03:24:20,930
Yeah, people are just mad because...

3700
03:24:20,930 --> 03:24:21,930
Some people...

3701
03:24:24,570 --> 03:24:27,310
Some people got eliminated because of the announcement.

3702
03:24:28,510 --> 03:24:29,470
Yeah, some people...

3703
03:24:29,470 --> 03:24:31,310
Literally are just...

3704
03:24:31,310 --> 03:24:31,570
Bam!

3705
03:24:31,650 --> 03:24:33,230
Clicking shit just for...

3706
03:24:33,230 --> 03:24:35,230
To test things out because they heard there was a rerun.

3707
03:24:35,730 --> 03:24:36,070
Yeah.

3708
03:24:36,510 --> 03:24:39,670
A lot of people lost a lot of points because of that.

3709
03:24:47,090 --> 03:24:47,610
Yeah.

3710
03:24:49,530 --> 03:24:49,690
Yeah.

3711
03:24:49,810 --> 03:24:50,410
Yeah, that's so true.

3712
03:24:50,710 --> 03:24:53,430
You gain more from being a hunter because like...

3713
03:24:53,430 --> 03:24:55,290
As a prop, you only gain four points.

3714
03:24:55,430 --> 03:24:57,570
For surviving ten minutes.

3715
03:24:58,670 --> 03:25:01,050
When a hunter can get...

3716
03:25:01,570 --> 03:25:02,490
No, for five minutes.

3717
03:25:04,650 --> 03:25:05,570
I didn't either.

3718
03:25:05,930 --> 03:25:08,370
I survived four minutes at most.

3719
03:25:08,910 --> 03:25:10,050
Because there's just too many hunters.

3720
03:25:10,050 --> 03:25:12,030
By the time four minutes hit...

3721
03:25:12,030 --> 03:25:13,110
There's just too many hunters.

3722
03:25:14,750 --> 03:25:15,550
And like...

3723
03:25:15,550 --> 03:25:17,530
Yo, whoever that is in the fucking general chat...

3724
03:25:17,530 --> 03:25:18,670
Is sucking mad dick.

3725
03:25:19,150 --> 03:25:21,990
What do you mean you got eliminated and thought the event was fun?

3726
03:25:22,450 --> 03:25:23,410
Like the last game?

3727
03:25:23,530 --> 03:25:24,430
Or the whole entire event?

3728
03:25:24,430 --> 03:25:27,870
I obviously thought that last game was fun.

3729
03:25:27,910 --> 03:25:28,850
You're pissing me off.

3730
03:25:30,170 --> 03:25:31,490
Dick rider!

3731
03:25:37,770 --> 03:25:40,730
That last game was not fun.

3732
03:25:40,910 --> 03:25:41,970
Don't lie.

3733
03:25:42,670 --> 03:25:44,540
That last game was so frustrating.

3734
03:25:46,870 --> 03:25:48,250
The Twitch Rivals guy is typing.

3735
03:25:48,930 --> 03:25:49,890
Oh shit.

3736
03:25:54,850 --> 03:25:56,710
That's so funny.

3737
03:25:58,490 --> 03:26:00,150
There's no way.

3738
03:26:02,610 --> 03:26:04,130
I'm about to launch Pokemon.

3739
03:26:06,130 --> 03:26:07,990
If I fucking give a fuck.

3740
03:26:08,050 --> 03:26:08,630
What the hell?

3741
03:26:09,770 --> 03:26:12,850
The Twitch Rivals person is...

3742
03:26:14,350 --> 03:26:16,290
Is typing now.

3743
03:26:18,230 --> 03:26:20,030
The thing is...

3744
03:26:20,030 --> 03:26:23,990
If they say eliminate all the people...

3745
03:26:23,990 --> 03:26:25,730
They're gonna have 30 really angry...

3746
03:26:25,730 --> 03:26:26,710
Well, not 29.

3747
03:26:27,170 --> 03:26:28,630
No, 28 because I don't care anymore.

3748
03:26:28,950 --> 03:26:30,970
28 really angry streamers.

3749
03:26:31,610 --> 03:26:32,910
And I think like...

3750
03:26:32,910 --> 03:26:34,770
I think SadSnap is in it.

3751
03:26:39,110 --> 03:26:40,050
I think...

3752
03:26:40,050 --> 03:26:44,310
I think Snap is one of those 28 really angry...

3753
03:26:44,310 --> 03:26:45,610
Players that got eliminated.

3754
03:26:45,610 --> 03:26:46,050
Oh, this head?

3755
03:26:47,130 --> 03:26:49,930
Because of the lack of clarity in the game mechanics of PopPun...

3756
03:26:49,930 --> 03:26:51,710
We've determined that the game did not work fairly.

3757
03:26:51,710 --> 03:26:53,910
We invite all players for today...

3758
03:26:53,910 --> 03:26:55,990
Who participate in this game to join us tomorrow.

3759
03:26:56,510 --> 03:26:58,010
Tomorrow we will run three events...

3760
03:26:58,010 --> 03:26:58,790
Starting with doll game.

3761
03:26:58,970 --> 03:27:00,930
And the 30 people who should have been eliminated...

3762
03:27:00,930 --> 03:27:02,070
Will be eliminated then.

3763
03:27:03,350 --> 03:27:03,830
What?

3764
03:27:04,150 --> 03:27:06,310
So you're making us fucking get eliminated tomorrow?

3765
03:27:07,710 --> 03:27:08,950
I don't get it.

3766
03:27:09,030 --> 03:27:10,390
What are you saying?

3767
03:27:14,820 --> 03:27:15,300
What?

3768
03:27:15,720 --> 03:27:17,380
We will run three games starting with the doll game.

3769
03:27:17,480 --> 03:27:19,720
And the 30 people who should have been eliminated...

3770
03:27:19,720 --> 03:27:21,000
Will be eliminated then.

3771
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:23,160
I guess we're gonna play doll game...

3772
03:27:23,160 --> 03:27:25,000
And then we're gonna see who are the 30 people...

3773
03:27:26,180 --> 03:27:27,000
That are gonna...

3774
03:27:27,560 --> 03:27:29,460
That are gonna...

3775
03:27:29,460 --> 03:27:29,920
I don't know.

3776
03:27:30,040 --> 03:27:31,460
Why doll game?

3777
03:27:32,980 --> 03:27:34,260
That was so...

3778
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:35,740
That was...

3779
03:27:35,740 --> 03:27:38,600
I think I hated that game the most.

3780
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:41,760
That game was so anxiety and anxiousness.

3781
03:27:42,060 --> 03:27:43,400
I think we should go Sky.

3782
03:27:46,980 --> 03:27:49,360
I think we go Sky, Doki.

3783
03:27:49,360 --> 03:27:50,460
What do you mean Sky?

3784
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:51,340
What does that mean?

3785
03:27:55,080 --> 03:27:57,400
I can't say it, but...

3786
03:27:58,640 --> 03:27:59,620
Type it.

3787
03:28:02,260 --> 03:28:03,740
Alright, I'm gonna type it.

3788
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:07,400
I think we should...

3789
03:28:24,810 --> 03:28:26,730
Oh my god.

3790
03:28:27,370 --> 03:28:27,630
Oh my god.

3791
03:28:27,630 --> 03:28:29,170
This game is pissing me off.

3792
03:28:29,470 --> 03:28:31,050
Oh my god.

3793
03:28:32,630 --> 03:28:33,270
Guys.

3794
03:28:38,120 --> 03:28:39,500
Oh my god.

3795
03:28:40,180 --> 03:28:41,560
People are not happy.

3796
03:28:41,720 --> 03:28:43,340
Even though we're re-running...

3797
03:28:43,340 --> 03:28:44,760
Because we have to come back tomorrow.

3798
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:46,940
So people are not happy.

3799
03:28:47,240 --> 03:28:49,760
But there's one person...

3800
03:28:49,760 --> 03:28:51,980
That's extremely happy.

3801
03:28:58,420 --> 03:29:00,840
And it's the one person...

3802
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:01,920
Everyone knows.

3803
03:29:02,320 --> 03:29:05,120
Very happy right now.

3804
03:29:15,760 --> 03:29:17,540
Because if they didn't...

3805
03:29:17,540 --> 03:29:18,740
They would've been eliminated.

3806
03:29:19,160 --> 03:29:20,000
And they...

3807
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:23,640
I bet you Twitch staff did not want to piss them off.

3808
03:29:26,800 --> 03:29:28,280
Wait, they're kind of spitting.

3809
03:29:28,580 --> 03:29:29,260
Wait, hold on.

3810
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:29,700
Pause.

3811
03:29:30,880 --> 03:29:32,780
The person typing in chat is kind of spitting.

3812
03:29:33,100 --> 03:29:33,660
Wait, why?

3813
03:29:33,880 --> 03:29:34,440
What did they say?

3814
03:29:35,100 --> 03:29:37,880
They think that the people who...

3815
03:29:37,880 --> 03:29:38,100
Made the game...

3816
03:29:38,100 --> 03:29:39,340
Made it today should have to play.

3817
03:29:39,500 --> 03:29:40,980
And I kind of agree with that.

3818
03:29:41,020 --> 03:29:42,520
Yeah, I agree with that honestly.

3819
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:44,380
But the thing is they have to eliminate 30.

3820
03:29:44,680 --> 03:29:47,620
Or they cut the eliminations to like 15.

3821
03:29:49,060 --> 03:29:50,900
Well, then that would make sense for the later games.

3822
03:29:50,980 --> 03:29:52,020
Because I think they like...

3823
03:29:52,020 --> 03:29:53,260
Coded it specifically.

3824
03:29:57,960 --> 03:29:58,760
Where um...

3825
03:29:59,400 --> 03:30:02,020
Where they're forced...

3826
03:30:02,640 --> 03:30:03,800
Sorry, I'm fucking playing...

3827
03:30:03,800 --> 03:30:04,580
Poker Rogue right now.

3828
03:30:04,580 --> 03:30:06,060
Where they're forced to um...

3829
03:30:06,060 --> 03:30:08,720
Have a set amount of people per day.

3830
03:30:08,720 --> 03:30:09,280
Yeah, oh that's true.

3831
03:30:09,380 --> 03:30:10,020
Like per lobby.

3832
03:30:10,620 --> 03:30:11,280
That's true.

3833
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:13,560
What did AntVenom posted?

3834
03:30:13,800 --> 03:30:16,380
Someone told me to look at what AntVenom tweeted.

3835
03:30:17,260 --> 03:30:17,940
They didn't tweet it.

3836
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:21,180
Wait, they didn't tweet it to say anything.

3837
03:30:21,480 --> 03:30:22,040
What do you mean?

3838
03:30:23,360 --> 03:30:24,760
Or did it say something in my chat?

3839
03:30:26,020 --> 03:30:30,200
Dude, I don't think AntVenom himself would go out of his way to go into your chat.

3840
03:30:30,400 --> 03:30:30,940
Yeah, I know.

3841
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:32,580
That's why someone was like, look at what AntVenom...

3842
03:30:32,580 --> 03:30:34,380
What did they... I don't know what they said.

3843
03:30:34,880 --> 03:30:36,520
I was like, who's AntVenom?

3844
03:30:38,700 --> 03:30:40,620
I don't even know who that is.

3845
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:46,280
Omegalul.

3846
03:30:51,570 --> 03:30:52,790
I was like, who?

3847
03:30:57,510 --> 03:31:00,010
Oh my god, you see like people pulling up clips?

3848
03:31:00,010 --> 03:31:00,830
What?

3849
03:31:04,650 --> 03:31:07,150
I do, I do see it.

3850
03:31:12,180 --> 03:31:13,540
Join our voice channel?

3851
03:31:13,700 --> 03:31:14,640
Oh my god.

3852
03:31:14,720 --> 03:31:15,000
No.

3853
03:31:15,200 --> 03:31:16,620
He's being taken.

3854
03:31:17,940 --> 03:31:19,600
Oh my god.

3855
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:21,780
Wait, why are they taking this person?

3856
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:23,400
Did this person complain a lot?

3857
03:31:24,160 --> 03:31:24,820
I think this person...

3858
03:31:24,820 --> 03:31:27,640
This person wrote an entire...

3859
03:31:27,640 --> 03:31:31,880
Oh, that's the one that wrote like three paragraphs of why it's justified to not rerun?

3860
03:31:31,880 --> 03:31:32,680
Yeah, yeah.

3861
03:31:32,940 --> 03:31:35,940
Like the one that was like, was the game not fair?

3862
03:31:36,300 --> 03:31:36,720
Yes!

3863
03:31:37,260 --> 03:31:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3864
03:31:45,110 --> 03:31:47,590
Oh my god, they're kidnapping them.

3865
03:31:48,010 --> 03:31:50,390
They're kidnapping them to talk in voice.

3866
03:31:51,670 --> 03:31:52,490
It's Chover.

3867
03:31:53,070 --> 03:31:54,470
It's so Chover.

3868
03:32:00,180 --> 03:32:02,680
Oh my god, people don't even want to play anymore.

3869
03:32:03,360 --> 03:32:04,760
People are like...

3870
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:06,520
Like, this is messed up.

3871
03:32:06,600 --> 03:32:07,980
I don't even want to play anymore.

3872
03:32:08,140 --> 03:32:10,040
I think they should just give us the money.

3873
03:32:10,420 --> 03:32:11,200
Honestly, yeah.

3874
03:32:12,220 --> 03:32:13,720
Dude, just spread it.

3875
03:32:14,180 --> 03:32:15,600
Yeah, at this point.

3876
03:32:16,260 --> 03:32:18,440
I think that's the only thing that can make everybody happy.

3877
03:32:18,660 --> 03:32:19,740
Just spread the money.

3878
03:32:19,940 --> 03:32:22,540
Because like...

3879
03:32:22,540 --> 03:32:24,540
I mean, if it's like...

3880
03:32:24,540 --> 03:32:26,680
Yeah, like, just split from the 70k.

3881
03:32:28,460 --> 03:32:30,380
Because even so...

3882
03:32:30,380 --> 03:32:32,120
Like, they still get like...

3883
03:32:32,120 --> 03:32:33,600
Like, 30k.

3884
03:32:33,960 --> 03:32:35,600
That's still a lot of money.

3885
03:32:37,000 --> 03:32:37,380
Yeah.

3886
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:39,220
That's like the most...

3887
03:32:39,220 --> 03:32:41,700
That's like more than any other Twitch rivals.

3888
03:32:43,720 --> 03:32:44,800
Or not even that.

3889
03:32:44,840 --> 03:32:46,220
Just give like 500 each.

3890
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:47,300
That got eliminated.

3891
03:32:50,360 --> 03:32:51,560
No, the thing is...

3892
03:32:51,560 --> 03:32:53,540
First place gets 70k, chat.

3893
03:32:54,080 --> 03:32:54,880
That's the thing.

3894
03:32:55,300 --> 03:32:56,920
First place gets 70k.

3895
03:32:57,260 --> 03:32:59,880
So if they take like...

3896
03:32:59,880 --> 03:33:01,880
To like all the remaining players that got eliminated...

3897
03:33:02,760 --> 03:33:04,580
Then like, at best, not even like...

3898
03:33:04,580 --> 03:33:05,720
They can still keep 50k.

3899
03:33:05,980 --> 03:33:06,280
Yeah.

3900
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:10,160
The first place can at least keep 50k.

3901
03:33:10,240 --> 03:33:12,080
And that's still a lot of money.

3902
03:33:12,780 --> 03:33:14,380
50k is still a lot.

3903
03:33:18,000 --> 03:33:18,520
There's...

3904
03:33:18,520 --> 03:33:20,700
Oh my God, there's another thing.

3905
03:33:23,580 --> 03:33:24,460
There's more?

3906
03:33:27,140 --> 03:33:27,660
Dude...

3907
03:33:27,660 --> 03:33:29,040
I don't even want to look at that.

3908
03:33:29,060 --> 03:33:30,860
Wait, where's the more?

3909
03:33:33,260 --> 03:33:34,320
No, they're just typing.

3910
03:33:34,620 --> 03:33:35,180
Oh no, no.

3911
03:33:35,240 --> 03:33:37,920
They're just saying tomorrow will run 3 events starting with a doll game.

3912
03:33:40,580 --> 03:33:41,540
I guess like...

3913
03:33:41,540 --> 03:33:43,820
I guess they meant like...

3914
03:33:44,760 --> 03:33:47,720
30 people will just be eliminated in general with a doll game.

3915
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:49,100
God, a doll game was so strange.

3916
03:33:49,240 --> 03:33:51,260
I feel like they definitely need to adjust the doll game.

3917
03:33:51,700 --> 03:33:52,720
I feel like...

3918
03:33:52,720 --> 03:33:54,080
It shouldn't be...

3919
03:33:54,080 --> 03:33:54,900
It should be like...

3920
03:33:54,900 --> 03:33:57,380
If you get a safe doll, you should be just safe automatically.

3921
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:01,040
Sorry.

3922
03:34:01,480 --> 03:34:01,920
Do you see that?

3923
03:34:03,620 --> 03:34:04,880
I'm wearing the keg.

3924
03:34:05,940 --> 03:34:08,080
They put skull emojis right away.

3925
03:34:08,700 --> 03:34:09,080
That's so...

3926
03:34:09,080 --> 03:34:11,280
That's so tone deaf.

3927
03:34:11,900 --> 03:34:15,290
That's so...

3928
03:34:16,150 --> 03:34:18,630
That's like read the room.

3929
03:34:20,190 --> 03:34:22,630
For context, basically...

3930
03:34:22,630 --> 03:34:25,390
In announcements, they add all of us and said...

3931
03:34:25,390 --> 03:34:30,610
Don't forget that Twitch Rivals will be raiding and gifting 25 subs to your lucky random channel at the end of the day.

3932
03:34:31,110 --> 03:34:32,250
Just make sure to be streaming.

3933
03:34:33,850 --> 03:34:34,930
Everyone's mad.

3934
03:34:35,230 --> 03:34:37,630
People are mad right now because...

3935
03:34:38,570 --> 03:34:39,690
It's so...

3936
03:34:39,690 --> 03:34:41,070
It's so...

3937
03:34:41,070 --> 03:34:41,950
Oh my god.

3938
03:34:42,270 --> 03:34:45,550
And then people are reacting to it and putting like...

3939
03:34:45,910 --> 03:34:47,610
Skull emoji and keg.

3940
03:34:48,010 --> 03:34:48,410
W.

3941
03:34:50,530 --> 03:34:53,350
Dude, the first thing I saw was a skull emoji right away.

3942
03:34:53,350 --> 03:34:54,770
Yeah, yeah.

3943
03:34:55,210 --> 03:34:56,710
The skull emoji.

3944
03:34:57,450 --> 03:34:59,440
And someone reacted with the question mark.

3945
03:35:03,690 --> 03:35:05,440
Okay, whatever happens...

3946
03:35:05,890 --> 03:35:07,490
Not gonna lie, this was content.

3947
03:35:08,770 --> 03:35:10,510
It was good content.

3948
03:35:10,770 --> 03:35:11,810
Yeah, this is...

3949
03:35:13,430 --> 03:35:15,690
It's so fun to see drama...

3950
03:35:15,690 --> 03:35:16,910
When you're not involved in it.

3951
03:35:19,040 --> 03:35:20,990
You get to watch it in the sideline.

3952
03:35:20,990 --> 03:35:23,510
As everything's getting cooked right now.

3953
03:35:24,010 --> 03:35:25,550
I like how someone was like...

3954
03:35:25,550 --> 03:35:27,270
Please tell me where the last egg is.

3955
03:35:30,490 --> 03:35:32,730
Can you guys tell us where the last two eggs are?

3956
03:35:32,990 --> 03:35:34,730
Do you know where the last two eggs are?

3957
03:35:34,950 --> 03:35:37,390
Well, if we weren't eliminated, we would tell you.

3958
03:35:41,190 --> 03:35:42,090
Wait, what?

3959
03:35:42,490 --> 03:35:43,330
Wait, that's messed up.

3960
03:35:43,370 --> 03:35:43,990
Do you see that?

3961
03:35:44,530 --> 03:35:44,870
Where?

3962
03:35:45,450 --> 03:35:46,850
The dolls are ping-based.

3963
03:35:46,850 --> 03:35:48,930
So people get spawned randomly...

3964
03:35:48,930 --> 03:35:50,150
In the same position during the whole...

3965
03:35:50,150 --> 03:35:51,930
So if you're closer, you immediately get targeted.

3966
03:35:52,390 --> 03:35:54,830
So if you have worse ping, you basically spawn late.

3967
03:35:55,430 --> 03:35:58,850
Yeah, I know that, but apparently...

3968
03:36:01,410 --> 03:36:03,010
If you have bad ping...

3969
03:36:03,010 --> 03:36:03,890
You're closer to the doll.

3970
03:36:06,670 --> 03:36:07,950
That's actually messed up.

3971
03:36:07,990 --> 03:36:08,570
Wait, what?

3972
03:36:08,750 --> 03:36:10,290
That's so messed up.

3973
03:36:11,290 --> 03:36:12,790
I did not know that.

3974
03:36:19,470 --> 03:36:20,770
I'm mad at you.

3975
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:25,310
Wait, what?

3976
03:36:26,410 --> 03:36:30,790
I posted a screenshot of my PokeRogue.

3977
03:36:35,790 --> 03:36:37,030
Whoa, you're lagging!

3978
03:36:39,070 --> 03:36:40,430
You're lagging!

3979
03:36:40,830 --> 03:36:42,170
You're lagging!

3980
03:36:47,920 --> 03:36:49,940
Wait, 5UP made it in.

3981
03:36:50,080 --> 03:36:50,640
Oh, you know what?

3982
03:36:50,640 --> 03:36:52,380
Great, great for 5UP.

3983
03:36:52,520 --> 03:36:54,180
5UP made it in, but he's arguing...

3984
03:36:54,180 --> 03:36:56,460
He's representing the people that got eliminated.

3985
03:36:56,880 --> 03:36:57,600
Because he was...

3986
03:36:57,600 --> 03:36:59,780
He was mad that the chest was broken.

3987
03:37:01,480 --> 03:37:04,590
That's so funny!

3988
03:37:04,850 --> 03:37:06,330
Like, he made it...

3989
03:37:06,330 --> 03:37:07,230
But like...

3990
03:37:07,230 --> 03:37:10,330
He's really mad...

3991
03:37:10,330 --> 03:37:12,530
At the chest being broken.

3992
03:37:13,030 --> 03:37:15,010
That he's fighting for us.

3993
03:37:16,050 --> 03:37:17,930
It's about the principles.

3994
03:37:18,950 --> 03:37:20,030
He's a real one.

3995
03:37:22,550 --> 03:37:23,530
He's representing...

3996
03:37:23,530 --> 03:37:24,950
True, to be fair...

3997
03:37:24,950 --> 03:37:26,610
He would've had more points.

3998
03:37:26,950 --> 03:37:30,250
He could've had so much more points.

3999
03:37:30,650 --> 03:37:32,370
If that shit wasn't broken.

4000
03:37:33,790 --> 03:37:34,810
That's funny.

4001
03:37:35,570 --> 03:37:36,550
That's so funny.

4002
03:37:40,170 --> 03:37:42,250
Hey, someone's gotta represent us.

4003
03:37:43,030 --> 03:37:45,270
We're not even arguing, we're just watching.

4004
03:37:46,570 --> 03:37:49,390
I bet you they just didn't want to make that person mad.

4005
03:37:52,020 --> 03:37:53,760
It's true!

4006
03:37:55,560 --> 03:37:58,140
Because he was really mad.

4007
03:38:03,740 --> 03:38:06,200
Guys, if you could've seen...

4008
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,760
How mad he was.

4009
03:38:22,430 --> 03:38:22,830
Guys...

4010
03:38:25,950 --> 03:38:28,430
Yeah, they can't code that in time.

4011
03:38:30,010 --> 03:38:31,450
I guess they could do that for the dolls.

4012
03:38:35,380 --> 03:38:36,260
Someone said I got...

4013
03:38:36,260 --> 03:38:37,320
Wait, is Sylphie trolling?

4014
03:38:37,320 --> 03:38:40,520
There's no way you can get 47 points as a hunter.

4015
03:38:44,460 --> 03:38:45,480
Oh, over all the rounds.

4016
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:46,740
She's also one of the hosts.

4017
03:38:46,820 --> 03:38:47,860
She's also a host.

4018
03:38:48,940 --> 03:38:49,340
Wait,

4019
03:38:53,600 --> 03:38:54,240
as a hunter?

4020
03:38:55,420 --> 03:38:55,820
Yeah.

4021
03:38:56,040 --> 03:38:57,820
Wait, how the heck did she get 47?

4022
03:38:58,660 --> 03:39:00,360
She probably just hunted multiple rounds.

4023
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:03,200
Wait, she got hunter multiple rounds?

4024
03:39:05,240 --> 03:39:07,060
Wait, I thought you could only get it once.

4025
03:39:07,180 --> 03:39:08,140
Wait, that's not fair.

4026
03:39:08,140 --> 03:39:11,780
Girl, that's what we were talking about!

4027
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:12,700
Yeah, I didn't realize!

4028
03:39:13,220 --> 03:39:15,660
I thought you'd be like, oh you can get it once and you won't get it again.

4029
03:39:15,760 --> 03:39:16,780
But that's actually rigged!

4030
03:39:16,860 --> 03:39:18,000
If you can get double hunter!

4031
03:39:19,660 --> 03:39:20,440
Wait a minute!

4032
03:39:20,500 --> 03:39:21,840
Okay, now I'm mad.

4033
03:39:27,140 --> 03:39:28,200
Now I'm mad.

4034
03:39:30,340 --> 03:39:32,160
Now I'm gonna start typing.

4035
03:39:32,540 --> 03:39:34,220
Now I'm gonna be mad too.

4036
03:39:36,800 --> 03:39:41,380
I went in and be like, well at least you can get hunter only once if you do get it.

4037
03:39:41,380 --> 03:39:45,420
But you get multiple hunters?

4038
03:39:45,540 --> 03:39:47,460
Yeah, there are some people who got hunter multiple times.

4039
03:39:47,960 --> 03:39:49,300
What is this RNG?

4040
03:39:52,140 --> 03:39:54,320
So it's like, Doki is typing now.

4041
03:39:58,240 --> 03:40:00,640
Did you see me pop up?

4042
03:40:01,200 --> 03:40:01,400
What?

4043
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:03,320
Wait, give me a second.

4044
03:40:04,460 --> 03:40:06,520
I think I should also win.

4045
03:40:06,640 --> 03:40:07,680
Yeah, I'm pumped for you.

4046
03:40:07,960 --> 03:40:14,500
I think we should not rerun the game, but I think you should give us our money.

4047
03:40:16,580 --> 03:40:18,180
Wait, honestly?

4048
03:40:19,660 --> 03:40:28,660
Just re-divide the prizes and give 500 to the people that got eliminated.

4049
03:40:30,640 --> 03:40:34,580
I added the mouth there so people won't take it too seriously.

4050
03:40:34,740 --> 03:40:36,280
But I'm sort of serious.

4051
03:40:40,520 --> 03:40:41,520
I'm not joking.

4052
03:40:43,420 --> 03:40:44,860
Hold on, don't worry, I'll support you.

4053
03:40:45,040 --> 03:40:46,120
Wait, she's cooking.

4054
03:40:54,340 --> 03:40:58,480
I'm probably satisfied, I got 500 dollars for 3 days of this.

4055
03:40:58,840 --> 03:41:00,180
I'll take that.

4056
03:41:04,840 --> 03:41:12,400
Oh my god, look at what's happening.

4057
03:41:12,920 --> 03:41:13,220
What?

4058
03:41:13,780 --> 03:41:15,080
Look, look in the chat.

4059
03:41:15,180 --> 03:41:15,760
They're fighting.

4060
03:41:17,060 --> 03:41:19,560
People are mad about the copyright stuff.

4061
03:41:19,860 --> 03:41:22,060
To be fair, they told people that...

4062
03:41:22,060 --> 03:41:24,200
Oh my god, he's calling...

4063
03:41:24,200 --> 03:41:25,520
Look at him.

4064
03:41:25,860 --> 03:41:27,200
Look at him.

4065
03:41:27,320 --> 03:41:28,800
He's calling out people reacting.

4066
03:41:30,520 --> 03:41:33,240
Oh my god, he's calling people out for the music stuff.

4067
03:41:36,940 --> 03:41:41,220
If you guys are in the Discord right now...

4068
03:41:41,220 --> 03:41:43,340
Minecrafters are fighting.

4069
03:41:43,620 --> 03:41:45,440
They're actually fighting.

4070
03:41:48,180 --> 03:41:49,560
They're fighting.

4071
03:41:50,220 --> 03:41:51,900
Shakira, Shakira.

4072
03:41:52,080 --> 03:41:59,500
Somebody called out another Minecrafter for playing music and they responded, cry.

4073
03:42:03,810 --> 03:42:06,230
Oh my god.

4074
03:42:13,890 --> 03:42:16,390
Oh my god.

4075
03:42:17,970 --> 03:42:19,210
That's actually crazy.

4076
03:42:19,670 --> 03:42:22,190
Holy shit, I'm enjoying this now.

4077
03:42:23,830 --> 03:42:25,610
Wait, I'm down.

4078
03:42:26,330 --> 03:42:30,450
I'm down to keep going if I get to see stuff like this.

4079
03:42:31,250 --> 03:42:32,630
Fight, fight, fight.

4080
03:42:33,730 --> 03:42:34,850
Minecraft fight.

4081
03:42:35,470 --> 03:42:36,390
Take it to bedwars.

4082
03:42:36,450 --> 03:42:38,490
They should just take it to the bedwars to settle it.

4083
03:42:41,390 --> 03:42:43,550
I think you guys should 1v1.

4084
03:42:43,650 --> 03:42:46,490
I think you guys should just take it to the bedwars.

4085
03:42:48,650 --> 03:42:50,070
I think you guys should take it to bed.

4086
03:42:51,210 --> 03:42:52,290
Who said that?

4087
03:42:52,430 --> 03:42:53,030
Who said that?

4088
03:42:53,950 --> 03:42:56,190
Some repressed rage there.

4089
03:43:00,070 --> 03:43:01,350
Oh my god.

4090
03:43:03,130 --> 03:43:04,190
Oh my god.

4091
03:43:04,990 --> 03:43:05,950
Just give us $500.

4092
03:43:05,950 --> 03:43:09,110
I'm satisfied.

4093
03:43:10,190 --> 03:43:11,470
$500.

4094
03:43:16,470 --> 03:43:17,750
Guys.

4095
03:43:19,730 --> 03:43:22,090
I think Doki was right.

4096
03:43:24,090 --> 03:43:28,150
I think they should give us money.

4097
03:43:31,570 --> 03:43:32,590
That's all.

4098
03:43:32,590 --> 03:43:32,790
That's all.

4099
03:43:33,750 --> 03:43:34,790
Tongue out emoji.

4100
03:43:39,470 --> 03:43:42,090
I like how both of us, we don't care anymore.

4101
03:43:42,310 --> 03:43:44,210
We don't even want to come day 4.

4102
03:43:44,630 --> 03:43:45,630
Just give us the money.

4103
03:43:46,430 --> 03:43:47,990
Just give us the money.

4104
03:43:53,600 --> 03:43:57,080
I think $500 per person is good.

4105
03:43:57,580 --> 03:43:59,460
$500 per person who got eliminated.

4106
03:43:59,900 --> 03:44:01,620
We already invested 3 days of this.

4107
03:44:01,620 --> 03:44:03,620
Yeah, suck my balls.

4108
03:44:04,240 --> 03:44:04,860
Yeah.

4109
03:44:11,260 --> 03:44:13,850
Oh man, if you guys could only see...

4110
03:44:16,200 --> 03:44:19,200
If you guys could only see the skirt fight.

4111
03:44:20,420 --> 03:44:22,260
It was actually so good.

4112
03:44:27,350 --> 03:44:29,760
I say revive everyone from the whole event.

4113
03:44:31,740 --> 03:44:32,460
Let's all donate and double the prize pool.

4114
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:40,800
Instead of $70k, the first place player can get $140k.

4115
03:44:42,060 --> 03:44:45,980
Let's all donate and double the prize pool.

4116
03:44:49,140 --> 03:44:52,360
The ad was like, please feel free to log off.

4117
03:44:52,460 --> 03:44:54,120
We're continuing to discuss this.

4118
03:44:54,840 --> 03:44:56,900
They're still working on a solution.

4119
03:44:58,000 --> 03:44:59,480
Girl, is there no solution?

4120
03:44:59,780 --> 03:45:00,860
What's going on?

4121
03:45:01,360 --> 03:45:02,740
Bro, just end the tournament.

4122
03:45:03,240 --> 03:45:04,760
Just end the event.

4123
03:45:06,380 --> 03:45:06,780
Amazon,

4124
03:45:10,720 --> 03:45:11,640
we know you have a lot of money.

4125
03:45:11,760 --> 03:45:14,280
Just increase the prize pool and give all of us free money.

4126
03:45:14,480 --> 03:45:14,660
Amazon, please!

4127
03:45:14,960 --> 03:45:16,940
Amazon, Jeff Bezos, please!

4128
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:19,160
Twitch is losing money every year.

4129
03:45:19,800 --> 03:45:20,780
If you guys didn't know that, chat.

4130
03:45:21,860 --> 03:45:23,820
It's been in the negatives for years now.

4131
03:45:23,900 --> 03:45:25,520
They have not been a profit, by the way.

4132
03:45:25,520 --> 03:45:27,240
I think Twitch...

4133
03:45:27,240 --> 03:45:29,680
For Amazon, Twitch is like a...

4134
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:31,160
What is it called?

4135
03:45:31,220 --> 03:45:32,780
A tax write-off type deal.

4136
03:45:33,600 --> 03:45:34,820
They know it doesn't profit.

4137
03:45:35,220 --> 03:45:38,680
But they're only doing it because it's a nice tax write-off.

4138
03:45:39,620 --> 03:45:40,140
Yeah.

4139
03:45:45,500 --> 03:45:47,300
It's like a vanity project.

4140
03:45:48,240 --> 03:45:49,020
A loss leader?

4141
03:45:49,400 --> 03:45:51,000
What does loss leader mean?

4142
03:45:51,320 --> 03:45:53,220
Guys, let's learn economics while people are fighting.

4143
03:45:53,220 --> 03:45:54,800
Double just typed, can I get revived?

4144
03:45:59,820 --> 03:46:02,520
Yes, I think we should revive him.

4145
03:46:03,020 --> 03:46:05,220
Now that he said something, I agree.

4146
03:46:06,040 --> 03:46:06,780
Yeah, I agree.

4147
03:46:07,160 --> 03:46:08,660
I like unfairly took his spot.

4148
03:46:15,480 --> 03:46:17,300
Someone's like, is there a call going on?

4149
03:46:17,460 --> 03:46:18,320
They want in.

4150
03:46:18,560 --> 03:46:20,120
They want in on this.

4151
03:46:23,420 --> 03:46:25,420
I'm glad all of you guys like drama.

4152
03:46:25,600 --> 03:46:26,740
Because I saw...

4153
03:46:26,740 --> 03:46:28,400
I don't know if it's the same for you, Gumi.

4154
03:46:28,580 --> 03:46:30,940
But I actually had more people watching now.

4155
03:46:31,060 --> 03:46:32,800
Just to know what the fuck is going on.

4156
03:46:33,220 --> 03:46:36,800
Just to know what the drama is like right now.

4157
03:46:40,700 --> 03:46:44,260
People are watching the game over screen.

4158
03:46:44,520 --> 03:46:48,400
To know what's going on in the Minecraft wars.

4159
03:46:49,720 --> 03:46:51,500
I think I stopped them from talking.

4160
03:46:51,580 --> 03:46:52,400
I think...

4161
03:46:53,620 --> 03:46:53,960
No!

4162
03:46:54,680 --> 03:46:56,140
I don't want to get in a call.

4163
03:46:56,320 --> 03:46:57,840
Wait, but we get in a call and mute ourselves.

4164
03:46:57,940 --> 03:46:58,820
We can listen to the fight.

4165
03:47:00,280 --> 03:47:00,820
I know.

4166
03:47:01,380 --> 03:47:02,120
Oh my god.

4167
03:47:02,500 --> 03:47:04,080
I think it'd be like world star.

4168
03:47:06,940 --> 03:47:07,540
Oh my god.

4169
03:47:07,560 --> 03:47:08,520
It's going to be like world star.

4170
03:47:10,580 --> 03:47:11,460
I think people...

4171
03:47:11,460 --> 03:47:11,920
Oh my gosh.

4172
03:47:12,360 --> 03:47:14,120
Wait, what is he saying in Spanish?

4173
03:47:14,120 --> 03:47:15,200
Deep L?

4174
03:47:15,320 --> 03:47:16,060
Deep L-ing is?

4175
03:47:16,700 --> 03:47:17,240
Deep L-ing?

4176
03:47:18,440 --> 03:47:19,760
See you tomorrow.

4177
03:47:19,780 --> 03:47:21,320
See you tomorrow, GGs.

4178
03:47:29,560 --> 03:47:31,120
Oh my god.

4179
03:47:33,220 --> 03:47:34,920
Yeah, it's just a see you tomorrow.

4180
03:47:35,220 --> 03:47:36,040
I like how like...

4181
03:47:36,040 --> 03:47:38,120
Everybody that was arguing, mostly...

4182
03:47:38,940 --> 03:47:40,340
They shut the fuck up.

4183
03:47:40,680 --> 03:47:40,980
What?

4184
03:47:41,560 --> 03:47:42,880
They all shut the fuck up.

4185
03:47:43,100 --> 03:47:43,580
No, no, no.

4186
03:47:43,680 --> 03:47:45,200
I meant like...

4187
03:47:45,200 --> 03:47:46,300
It was all in English.

4188
03:47:46,940 --> 03:47:48,020
Oh my god, they're beefing.

4189
03:47:48,340 --> 03:47:49,940
Look, look, look.

4190
03:47:52,900 --> 03:47:54,340
Your takes were not good.

4191
03:47:54,500 --> 03:47:55,880
Can I join a voice chat?

4192
03:47:56,160 --> 03:47:57,740
Oh my god, they're going to fight.

4193
03:48:04,670 --> 03:48:05,670
Oh my god.

4194
03:48:05,910 --> 03:48:07,430
They're going to go to voice chat, guys.

4195
03:48:13,210 --> 03:48:13,610
Goddamn.

4196
03:48:13,730 --> 03:48:14,630
Use your words.

4197
03:48:15,650 --> 03:48:17,190
Talk to me in person.

4198
03:48:18,470 --> 03:48:21,090
Don't use your fucking...

4199
03:48:21,090 --> 03:48:22,150
Don't type to me.

4200
03:48:22,210 --> 03:48:23,090
Don't type to me.

4201
03:48:23,330 --> 03:48:24,230
See if you can say it.

4202
03:48:24,390 --> 03:48:26,350
Look me in the eye and say it to my face.

4203
03:48:27,550 --> 03:48:28,850
Turn the webcam on.

4204
03:48:34,450 --> 03:48:35,830
Turn the webcam on.

4205
03:48:36,110 --> 03:48:37,330
And look me in the eye.

4206
03:48:37,410 --> 03:48:38,830
And talk to me like that.

4207
03:48:42,930 --> 03:48:44,670
Oh my god.

4208
03:48:45,090 --> 03:48:45,450
Oh my god.

4209
03:48:45,450 --> 03:48:47,210
Bro, are they going to a different...

4210
03:48:47,210 --> 03:48:49,310
Bro, are they going to a different...

4211
03:48:51,350 --> 03:48:52,270
Minecraft server...

4212
03:48:52,270 --> 03:48:53,230
To talk.

4213
03:48:53,990 --> 03:48:55,190
Wait, that's so funny.

4214
03:48:55,270 --> 03:48:55,950
Did you see that?

4215
03:48:56,230 --> 03:48:58,390
They're not even going to use this server.

4216
03:48:58,390 --> 03:48:59,050
Oh my god.

4217
03:48:59,110 --> 03:49:01,450
Do you know what that stands for?

4218
03:49:01,610 --> 03:49:01,910
What?

4219
03:49:04,070 --> 03:49:06,830
Oh man, it's like ultimate hardcore or something.

4220
03:49:07,810 --> 03:49:09,170
Oh my god.

4221
03:49:09,190 --> 03:49:10,930
It stands for hardcore minecrafters.

4222
03:49:11,150 --> 03:49:12,030
Oh my god.

4223
03:49:12,210 --> 03:49:14,490
It's like an exclusive minecraft server.

4224
03:49:14,850 --> 03:49:17,750
An exclusive minecraft server voice chat.

4225
03:49:18,210 --> 03:49:20,650
Guys, they're not even going to argue in this server.

4226
03:49:20,790 --> 03:49:23,950
They're taking it to the ultimate hardcore minecraft server.

4227
03:49:24,250 --> 03:49:27,410
With all the ultimate hardcore players to duke it out.

4228
03:49:27,870 --> 03:49:29,810
In voice chat.

4229
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:31,730
Holy fuck.

4230
03:49:33,290 --> 03:49:34,690
That's crazy.

4231
03:49:34,690 --> 03:49:36,690
That's actually crazy.

4232
03:49:38,070 --> 03:49:42,790
They're going to the S rank minecraft server.

4233
03:49:43,790 --> 03:49:46,450
The fight is not for us peasants.

4234
03:49:48,090 --> 03:49:50,690
Oh my god, they're not even going to let us watch?

4235
03:49:51,050 --> 03:49:51,370
They're not.

4236
03:49:51,470 --> 03:49:52,050
I know.

4237
03:49:53,450 --> 03:49:55,070
Why are they tired of us typing?

4238
03:49:55,350 --> 03:49:57,730
Tell Amfrost to give us an invite right now.

4239
03:50:00,090 --> 03:50:00,650
Amfrost.

4240
03:50:00,650 --> 03:50:03,850
We want to listen in.

4241
03:50:04,130 --> 03:50:05,750
It's not fair.

4242
03:50:06,870 --> 03:50:08,030
The content we're missing.

4243
03:50:08,030 --> 03:50:10,610
I want to know DT, let me in.

4244
03:50:14,410 --> 03:50:15,890
I can't believe it.

4245
03:50:15,970 --> 03:50:18,570
The off screen Goku vs Frieza.

4246
03:50:20,830 --> 03:50:22,510
Oh my god, he sent me an invite.

4247
03:50:23,030 --> 03:50:28,260
Oh my god.

4248
03:50:29,740 --> 03:50:30,300
Guys.

4249
03:50:30,620 --> 03:50:33,520
Guys, we're in the ultimate hardcore server.

4250
03:50:34,840 --> 03:50:36,160
Wait, I don't have a role.

4251
03:50:36,500 --> 03:50:37,140
I don't have a role.

4252
03:50:37,940 --> 03:50:39,420
Give me a role.

4253
03:50:41,060 --> 03:50:42,860
Oh my god, bro.

4254
03:50:43,900 --> 03:50:47,240
Bro, I see all the minecraft players, guys.

4255
03:50:48,520 --> 03:50:49,560
Oh my god.

4256
03:50:50,860 --> 03:50:53,660
They gave us a role just to like...

4257
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:56,320
Just to look at the waiter.

4258
03:50:56,760 --> 03:50:58,120
We have no role.

4259
03:50:58,300 --> 03:51:00,140
We have no role so we can't see.

4260
03:51:00,140 --> 03:51:00,820
He's the owner of the server.

4261
03:51:01,020 --> 03:51:03,720
He's literally the owner of the server.

4262
03:51:04,100 --> 03:51:05,260
Give me a fucking role.

4263
03:51:05,500 --> 03:51:07,460
Give us a role right now.

4264
03:51:07,580 --> 03:51:10,420
We want to listen to this fight.

4265
03:51:12,400 --> 03:51:13,500
Guys, we're so cool.

4266
03:51:13,560 --> 03:51:18,220
Guys, we're so cool that we're at the ultimate hardcore minecraft server.

4267
03:51:18,280 --> 03:51:18,680
I'm in.

4268
03:51:19,280 --> 03:51:20,120
I'm not in yet.

4269
03:51:21,980 --> 03:51:22,980
They gave me a role too.

4270
03:51:22,980 --> 03:51:24,400
It's because you're offline.

4271
03:51:24,780 --> 03:51:27,280
The rare online moment.

4272
03:51:30,040 --> 03:51:34,460
I just want you to know I haven't been online for 3 months.

4273
03:51:34,680 --> 03:51:36,820
Or not 3 months, for like...

4274
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:43,920
If anything...

4275
03:51:44,440 --> 03:51:45,920
We can't talk to each other.

4276
03:51:46,160 --> 03:51:46,680
We can type.

4277
03:51:48,360 --> 03:51:49,200
I'll type to you.

4278
03:51:49,200 --> 03:51:49,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4279
03:51:51,880 --> 03:51:54,040
I'll read it out loud what you say to my chat.

4280
03:51:54,140 --> 03:51:54,600
I'll join.

4281
03:51:55,900 --> 03:51:56,980
I'm not in yet.

4282
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:57,700
I don't have a role yet.

4283
03:51:58,420 --> 03:51:59,460
I told him to give me a role.

4284
03:52:00,860 --> 03:52:02,000
Wait, what about my role?

4285
03:52:03,300 --> 03:52:04,660
Bitch, I told him to give him a role.

4286
03:52:05,060 --> 03:52:05,840
You just have to wait.

4287
03:52:07,140 --> 03:52:08,480
We're missing information right now.

4288
03:52:09,200 --> 03:52:10,200
You type me the info.

4289
03:52:10,420 --> 03:52:11,160
I'll read it out in the chat.

4290
03:52:12,120 --> 03:52:13,260
I'll wait like 1 minute.

4291
03:52:13,360 --> 03:52:14,940
If he doesn't give me a role, I'm gonna yell at you.

4292
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:16,620
Okay, I'll call you back then.

4293
03:52:16,620 --> 03:52:17,940
Okay, okay, okay.

4294
03:52:17,940 --> 03:52:20,800
Okay, Gumi is gonna give us the insider knowledge.

4295
03:52:21,060 --> 03:52:22,640
I still don't have a role yet.

4296
03:52:22,880 --> 03:52:24,880
I still don't have...

4297
03:52:26,140 --> 03:52:26,940
We're...

4298
03:52:28,080 --> 03:52:28,880
Sad.

4299
03:52:32,480 --> 03:52:36,500
They're talking about the spawn spots.

4300
03:52:40,340 --> 03:52:42,580
They're actually beefing!

4301
03:52:42,580 --> 03:52:46,840
I need to know.

4302
03:52:47,340 --> 03:52:50,400
Oh my god, they're actually beefing!

4303
03:52:59,540 --> 03:53:03,540
I'm missing good beefing content.

4304
03:53:10,180 --> 03:53:12,480
I can't believe it.

4305
03:53:12,480 --> 03:53:12,820
No!

4306
03:53:14,820 --> 03:53:16,920
Minecraft streamers are wild.

4307
03:53:17,320 --> 03:53:19,960
Bro, apparently they're actually arguing.

4308
03:53:20,620 --> 03:53:22,220
Oh my god.

4309
03:53:22,360 --> 03:53:24,620
They're talking about spawn spots.

4310
03:53:25,380 --> 03:53:26,780
What the heck does that mean?

4311
03:53:32,920 --> 03:53:34,520
Oh my god.

4312
03:53:34,600 --> 03:53:35,540
Okay, guys.

4313
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:37,240
We're gonna...

4314
03:53:37,240 --> 03:53:40,120
We don't have the role yet, so I'm gonna steal Gumi's content right now.

4315
03:53:42,560 --> 03:53:43,200
Guys.

4316
03:53:44,100 --> 03:53:45,500
I'm gonna steal Gumi's content.

4317
03:53:50,670 --> 03:53:53,630
What the heck is this nerd talk?

4318
03:54:01,390 --> 03:54:02,850
Oh my god.

4319
03:54:10,140 --> 03:54:11,660
What the heck?

4320
03:54:21,800 --> 03:54:22,440
Guys,

4321
03:54:32,120 --> 03:54:32,700
I got the role!

4322
03:54:32,940 --> 03:54:34,180
No more stealing content!

4323
03:54:34,360 --> 03:54:35,060
I got the role!

4324
03:54:35,060 --> 03:54:36,260
Okay, I'm going in, I'm going in.

4325
03:54:36,400 --> 03:54:38,620
I'm going in.

4326
03:54:42,120 --> 03:54:42,780
Bro!

4327
03:54:48,560 --> 03:54:49,060
There's...

4328
03:54:49,760 --> 03:54:51,500
There's 20 people!

4329
03:54:55,760 --> 03:54:59,000
There's 17 people in this car!

4330
03:55:00,080 --> 03:55:00,780
Yo, sorry dude.

4331
03:55:01,000 --> 03:55:01,840
Sorry dude.

4332
03:55:01,840 --> 03:55:02,760
That was interesting.

4333
03:55:03,700 --> 03:55:04,640
Yo, sorry to like...

4334
03:55:04,640 --> 03:55:07,140
Yo, sorry to like interrupt, but...

4335
03:55:07,140 --> 03:55:09,700
You guys should probably read what someone said.

4336
03:55:10,400 --> 03:55:11,840
Don't read it out loud.

4337
03:55:12,140 --> 03:55:13,460
Don't read it out loud.

4338
03:55:14,720 --> 03:55:15,980
You should read it.

4339
03:55:16,300 --> 03:55:17,380
That would like...

4340
03:55:17,380 --> 03:55:17,680
Yeah.

4341
03:55:19,840 --> 03:55:20,480
Hashtag VC.

4342
03:55:21,080 --> 03:55:21,720
Hashtag VC.

4343
03:55:23,340 --> 03:55:25,440
No, I don't have the role to look at that way, do I?

4344
03:55:26,420 --> 03:55:27,260
Yeah, I figured.

4345
03:55:28,840 --> 03:55:30,380
That's what I was thinking as well.

4346
03:55:30,380 --> 03:55:31,860
Yeah, I figured as much.

4347
03:55:33,340 --> 03:55:34,140
Oh my god.

4348
03:55:34,140 --> 03:55:36,680
I mean, I just feel like eliminating 30 people off of a...

4349
03:55:36,680 --> 03:55:38,420
Mad RNG game is a bit crazy, bro.

4350
03:55:39,260 --> 03:55:39,960
Yeah, but isn't that the same...

4351
03:55:39,960 --> 03:55:41,980
Isn't that the same thing in like the Rock, Paper, Scissors game we played?

4352
03:55:42,120 --> 03:55:43,620
No, they can't hear me.

4353
03:55:43,700 --> 03:55:44,580
I muted myself on Discord.

4354
03:55:45,160 --> 03:55:46,740
I muted myself on Discord, guys.

4355
03:55:46,860 --> 03:55:48,140
You can stack a group with your friends.

4356
03:55:48,240 --> 03:55:50,460
Like, I think a lot of people work in the same circles with their friends.

4357
03:55:50,460 --> 03:55:51,720
Bro, this is a weird fight.

4358
03:55:52,060 --> 03:55:54,580
Like, I had an alliance of maybe five, six people.

4359
03:55:54,760 --> 03:55:55,640
If you...

4360
03:55:56,160 --> 03:55:57,480
Queue into your friends...

4361
03:56:01,780 --> 03:56:02,240
Yeah, you just queue your friends.

4362
03:56:03,620 --> 03:56:05,700
Well, you know, I'm not saying it's fair.

4363
03:56:06,840 --> 03:56:08,480
Yeah, no, you're allowed to hear it.

4364
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:10,760
You're allowed to hear it because other people are showing it.

4365
03:56:11,160 --> 03:56:12,360
Other people...

4366
03:56:12,360 --> 03:56:14,600
Other people are showing the nerd fight right now.

4367
03:56:16,540 --> 03:56:18,180
We're meant to hear this.

4368
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:21,080
Everyone else is streaming this cop.

4369
03:56:23,100 --> 03:56:23,620
Bro,

4370
03:56:27,340 --> 03:56:29,080
is this what Minecraft players talk about?

4371
03:56:29,380 --> 03:56:30,800
Is this what they argue about?

4372
03:56:32,660 --> 03:56:37,260
Bro, if this was an FPS game right now...

4373
03:56:37,940 --> 03:56:39,060
I'm going to say it.

4374
03:56:39,060 --> 03:56:41,080
If this was an FPS game...

4375
03:56:41,600 --> 03:56:43,320
And there's disagreements...

4376
03:56:43,320 --> 03:56:44,240
This is going to be...

4377
03:56:44,240 --> 03:56:45,940
It would be so much less civil.

4378
03:56:45,940 --> 03:56:46,880
It would be so much more civil.

4379
03:56:49,720 --> 03:56:53,880
FPS gamers will start saying the most fucked up shit.

4380
03:57:00,740 --> 03:57:03,460
This is actually like a nerd fight right now.

4381
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:07,540
It's different because that's the mechanic of the game.

4382
03:57:07,640 --> 03:57:09,760
The mechanic of the game is that you can lie to each other...

4383
03:57:09,760 --> 03:57:10,920
And do that to try and get points.

4384
03:57:11,020 --> 03:57:12,760
Whereas with this, there was no mechanic of the game.

4385
03:57:12,760 --> 03:57:14,040
If you got hunter round one...

4386
03:57:14,040 --> 03:57:15,440
You did not have to play the rest of the rounds.

4387
03:57:15,500 --> 03:57:16,940
You could have just killed everyone in the first round.

4388
03:57:20,720 --> 03:57:22,580
This is so civilized.

4389
03:57:23,160 --> 03:57:25,960
This is an actual debate club right now.

4390
03:57:27,060 --> 03:57:29,800
No, I've seen Apex with a lot of people argue.

4391
03:57:33,140 --> 03:57:33,940
Nerd fight.

4392
03:57:39,400 --> 03:57:40,880
This is an actual argument.

4393
03:57:42,760 --> 03:57:44,760
That's the only thing that's civilized though.

4394
03:57:46,640 --> 03:57:50,980
You could look at past games and say that.

4395
03:57:51,460 --> 03:57:54,040
Where are we drawing the line on what games get re-run or what doesn't?

4396
03:57:54,740 --> 03:57:58,980
I've seen fucked up shit when Apex and Overwatch gamers start arguing.

4397
03:57:59,320 --> 03:58:02,720
When FPS gamers start arguing, it's actually so messed up.

4398
03:58:02,820 --> 03:58:06,160
They get real personal unga bunga.

4399
03:58:08,560 --> 03:58:10,740
I feel like I'm in a debate club.

4400
03:58:11,160 --> 03:58:11,920
Here's my thing.

4401
03:58:12,040 --> 03:58:16,180
There was a lot more factors that were completely RNG.

4402
03:58:16,280 --> 03:58:19,140
If you spawned on the east wing, you spawned next to all three paintings.

4403
03:58:19,340 --> 03:58:21,060
So you could just run to all three paintings immediately.

4404
03:58:21,260 --> 03:58:23,740
And get 10 points, 15 points, however many points it was.

4405
03:58:24,140 --> 03:58:25,320
Just for the paintings.

4406
03:58:25,720 --> 03:58:28,000
I'm at upper volume so you guys can hear the argument better.

4407
03:58:29,420 --> 03:58:32,680
By the time they run to the east side, the hunters are coming out of the door killing them.

4408
03:58:33,340 --> 03:58:36,080
So there is no balance in the idea of...

4409
03:58:36,080 --> 03:58:37,280
Sure, but there's more randomness.

4410
03:58:37,400 --> 03:58:39,480
But we're saying that that's just not a good argument to re-run.

4411
03:58:40,040 --> 03:58:41,500
I'm not saying we should re-run.

4412
03:58:41,580 --> 03:58:42,220
Let me make that clear.

4413
03:58:43,520 --> 03:58:45,600
I'm not even saying that it should be re-run.

4414
03:58:45,700 --> 03:58:46,380
I'm not saying that's the solution.

4415
03:58:46,460 --> 03:58:47,680
I'm saying that game should have never been played.

4416
03:58:47,940 --> 03:58:51,600
That's the only take that is actually real.

4417
03:58:51,940 --> 03:58:53,800
That game was completely unbalanced.

4418
03:58:53,940 --> 03:58:54,620
And it shouldn't have been played.

4419
03:58:56,220 --> 03:58:59,260
On the first round, a hunter got 25 points.

4420
03:58:59,520 --> 03:59:01,720
And that's just an example of one hunter on the first round.

4421
03:59:02,420 --> 03:59:03,100
In a single round.

4422
03:59:03,380 --> 03:59:03,780
That's guaranteed.

4423
03:59:05,480 --> 03:59:06,700
That's only five kills.

4424
03:59:06,700 --> 03:59:08,800
One thing I'm saying about that is...

4425
03:59:08,800 --> 03:59:10,500
Sure, the hunting was OP.

4426
03:59:11,240 --> 03:59:11,880
But let's be honest.

4427
03:59:11,920 --> 03:59:13,500
When we were all sitting there and looking at the points.

4428
03:59:13,540 --> 03:59:15,320
We all knew that the hunting side was OP.

4429
03:59:16,180 --> 03:59:17,700
Everyone knew the hunting was going to be OP.

4430
03:59:18,280 --> 03:59:19,040
This is great.

4431
03:59:19,240 --> 03:59:20,500
I'm glad I made it to day three.

4432
03:59:21,480 --> 03:59:23,720
I'm so happy I made it to day three.

4433
03:59:26,120 --> 03:59:27,500
Yes, we know the hunter is OP.

4434
03:59:27,760 --> 03:59:29,260
There's not much we can do about that.

4435
03:59:30,560 --> 03:59:30,920
But...

4436
03:59:32,020 --> 03:59:33,220
If the hunter is so OP.

4437
03:59:33,640 --> 03:59:35,120
And a task isn't working.

4438
03:59:35,780 --> 03:59:38,220
Then the survivors are playing at such a huge deficit.

4439
03:59:38,580 --> 03:59:39,320
What's going on?

4440
03:59:39,680 --> 03:59:41,840
That's a goddamn nerd fight.

4441
03:59:42,060 --> 03:59:42,500
That's what.

4442
03:59:43,300 --> 03:59:45,980
You can't run the game with the survivors already at a disadvantage.

4443
03:59:45,980 --> 03:59:46,840
I'll show you guys.

4444
03:59:47,000 --> 03:59:48,760
I want to show you guys how many people.

4445
03:59:48,780 --> 03:59:50,660
There's a lot of people in this gauntlet.

4446
03:59:50,680 --> 03:59:51,960
Because if you spawn at that middle chest.

4447
03:59:52,300 --> 03:59:52,800
The turning one.

4448
03:59:52,900 --> 03:59:54,520
For me personally, which I spawned twice.

4449
03:59:54,820 --> 03:59:56,180
Fiddled with it for a solid minute.

4450
03:59:56,880 --> 03:59:57,860
Does not work for me.

4451
03:59:57,860 --> 03:59:59,420
So you can't have that as an argument.

4452
04:00:00,720 --> 04:00:01,500
And so if I spawn there.

4453
04:00:01,740 --> 04:00:02,640
And then I just lose the advantage.

4454
04:00:02,720 --> 04:00:04,880
Because now I'm at 20 seconds to find the other tasks.

4455
04:00:05,040 --> 04:00:06,200
And then the hunters just beeline it.

4456
04:00:06,340 --> 04:00:08,540
Bro, is this what being in a Minecraft community is like?

4457
04:00:08,540 --> 04:00:09,900
People fight like this?

4458
04:00:10,000 --> 04:00:10,940
And so I'm just fucked now.

4459
04:00:12,260 --> 04:00:13,900
You're not allowed to!

4460
04:00:13,940 --> 04:00:16,720
All the fiddle of the time and everything doesn't matter.

4461
04:00:16,840 --> 04:00:19,660
The only thing that actually matters is if the game is genuinely buggy.

4462
04:00:20,380 --> 04:00:21,640
Is this every day for them?

4463
04:00:21,700 --> 04:00:23,600
It doesn't matter how unbalanced anything is.

4464
04:00:23,640 --> 04:00:25,360
It doesn't matter how left or right anything happens.

4465
04:00:25,360 --> 04:00:28,100
If things work for some players and don't work for other players.

4466
04:00:28,200 --> 04:00:29,700
And they're doing the same inputs and the same everything.

4467
04:00:29,960 --> 04:00:32,200
That's what I can give up.

4468
04:00:32,480 --> 04:00:33,840
That's just the only thing that makes sense.

4469
04:00:34,000 --> 04:00:35,720
Nothing else about the balancing matters at all.

4470
04:00:35,860 --> 04:00:37,120
Everyone's going into the same game.

4471
04:00:37,400 --> 04:00:39,280
If it just genuinely doesn't work.

4472
04:00:40,280 --> 04:00:41,380
Then that's the only thing that makes sense.

4473
04:00:42,780 --> 04:00:42,900
Who?

4474
04:00:43,560 --> 04:00:43,860
Iskall?

4475
04:00:44,940 --> 04:00:47,540
He's adding another person to argue?

4476
04:00:48,420 --> 04:00:49,980
Like the problem with the tomorrow.

4477
04:00:50,260 --> 04:00:51,340
Is like one thing that's gonna happen.

4478
04:00:51,360 --> 04:00:52,640
Did you hear that?

4479
04:00:52,640 --> 04:00:53,760
Can we add the other guy?

4480
04:00:53,920 --> 04:00:54,740
He has some good points.

4481
04:00:58,520 --> 04:01:00,260
Another fighter has joined the lobby.

4482
04:01:01,600 --> 04:01:02,760
It did the same thing.

4483
04:01:02,860 --> 04:01:04,020
Where it just kind of spawned somewhere.

4484
04:01:04,700 --> 04:01:06,680
If we had to eliminate six people that last round.

4485
04:01:06,780 --> 04:01:07,600
And there's only one color.

4486
04:01:07,900 --> 04:01:09,600
And it spawned right in front of you.

4487
04:01:09,700 --> 04:01:10,380
That's not fair.

4488
04:01:10,980 --> 04:01:13,340
This is like a whole new world for us guys.

4489
04:01:13,400 --> 04:01:13,940
The solution's fixed.

4490
04:01:15,360 --> 04:01:17,540
It's still random if you spawn in front of it.

4491
04:01:18,480 --> 04:01:19,920
That's a strategy.

4492
04:01:20,020 --> 04:01:20,980
Here comes a new challenger.

4493
04:01:20,980 --> 04:01:22,560
No, if you don't know where you're spawning.

4494
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:25,440
I'm literally like the fly on the wall right now.

4495
04:01:25,820 --> 04:01:26,460
No, what I'm saying.

4496
04:01:26,580 --> 04:01:28,520
What I'm saying is.

4497
04:01:29,380 --> 04:01:31,200
You know how when it got to the end of the game.

4498
04:01:31,580 --> 04:01:33,180
And there was like only one color left.

4499
04:01:35,400 --> 04:01:36,560
It just kind of just.

4500
04:01:37,060 --> 04:01:37,960
Put it down somewhere.

4501
04:01:38,560 --> 04:01:40,080
And you didn't really get to choose.

4502
04:01:40,180 --> 04:01:42,520
It just kind of ended up spawning in front of you.

4503
04:01:42,560 --> 04:01:43,940
Because there was only one color left.

4504
04:01:44,780 --> 04:01:47,400
Imagine like the last round of tomorrow.

4505
04:01:47,600 --> 04:01:49,220
When you need to get rid of six people.

4506
04:01:49,220 --> 04:01:51,040
And it just spawns right in front of you.

4507
04:01:51,100 --> 04:01:52,320
Like that's just unlucky.

4508
04:01:54,100 --> 04:01:54,820
My argument.

4509
04:01:55,200 --> 04:01:56,640
My only argument for that is.

4510
04:01:56,820 --> 04:01:58,000
There is like the safe zones.

4511
04:01:58,040 --> 04:01:59,380
Which I'm hoping they would put more in.

4512
04:01:59,560 --> 04:02:00,260
And then that's a strategy.

4513
04:02:00,420 --> 04:02:01,160
Run to the safe zone.

4514
04:02:01,380 --> 04:02:02,080
Oh my god.

4515
04:02:02,300 --> 04:02:05,160
Why are they strategizing now?

4516
04:02:06,740 --> 04:02:08,240
You can't use that in an argument.

4517
04:02:08,500 --> 04:02:11,220
The only thing that I can get behind at all.

4518
04:02:11,380 --> 04:02:12,740
There's two things that the avants did wrong.

4519
04:02:12,840 --> 04:02:14,180
And this is an objective fact.

4520
04:02:14,180 --> 04:02:15,360
There's two things that they did wrong.

4521
04:02:15,460 --> 04:02:18,020
That would cause the game to have to be replayed.

4522
04:02:18,180 --> 04:02:19,540
As if there was genuine bugs.

4523
04:02:19,700 --> 04:02:20,640
Affecting people playing.

4524
04:02:21,000 --> 04:02:21,860
That stuff didn't work.

4525
04:02:21,980 --> 04:02:26,580
There were things that maybe some people could do on low ping.

4526
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:27,760
But other people couldn't do on high ping.

4527
04:02:27,800 --> 04:02:28,460
And they didn't test it.

4528
04:02:28,780 --> 04:02:29,800
That is valid.

4529
04:02:30,040 --> 04:02:31,100
The only other thing that's valid.

4530
04:02:31,280 --> 04:02:33,440
Is they cancelled it in the middle of the fourth game.

4531
04:02:33,740 --> 04:02:35,420
And some people trolled in their heads.

4532
04:02:35,480 --> 04:02:36,620
Knowing that it was going to be cancelled.

4533
04:02:36,740 --> 04:02:37,560
Because that's what they said.

4534
04:02:37,560 --> 04:02:38,800
And now they're going to walk it back.

4535
04:02:38,860 --> 04:02:42,240
Every RNG argument, we're not going to get anywhere.

4536
04:02:42,640 --> 04:02:44,260
There's no point in even talking about it.

4537
04:02:44,520 --> 04:02:46,080
Every single game you will ever play.

4538
04:02:46,320 --> 04:02:47,620
In any game.

4539
04:02:48,240 --> 04:02:48,800
In Minecraft.

4540
04:02:49,640 --> 04:02:51,800
Half of the games in this event.

4541
04:02:52,060 --> 04:02:54,060
Were made to have RNG in them.

4542
04:02:54,160 --> 04:02:55,880
Because they wanted it to be fair.

4543
04:02:55,980 --> 04:02:57,260
To the lower placing players.

4544
04:02:57,420 --> 04:02:58,980
That's why there's RNG factors.

4545
04:02:59,340 --> 04:03:00,620
The whole entire point of this event.

4546
04:03:00,980 --> 04:03:02,160
Was to maybe see.

4547
04:03:03,580 --> 04:03:05,980
Some random VTuber.

4548
04:03:05,980 --> 04:03:07,060
Versus Feinberg.

4549
04:03:07,080 --> 04:03:08,740
That's me!

4550
04:03:11,200 --> 04:03:12,160
That's me!

4551
04:03:12,340 --> 04:03:13,680
I'm the random VTuber!

4552
04:03:13,680 --> 04:03:14,620
Oh my god!

4553
04:03:15,620 --> 04:03:18,660
Guys, there's a lot of people in this call.

4554
04:03:19,040 --> 04:03:19,920
I just don't think it's going to happen.

4555
04:03:20,120 --> 04:03:20,660
So that's the point.

4556
04:03:21,000 --> 04:03:22,000
It's designed like that.

4557
04:03:22,300 --> 04:03:27,460
The RNG argument literally has no stake.

4558
04:03:27,580 --> 04:03:28,420
No impact on anything.

4559
04:03:28,740 --> 04:03:28,960
It's me!

4560
04:03:30,120 --> 04:03:31,340
They're talking about me!

4561
04:03:33,040 --> 04:03:35,060
I think that argument changes my mind.

4562
04:03:35,060 --> 04:03:36,600
Because I was against you on this.

4563
04:03:36,760 --> 04:03:38,680
I think that the RNG.

4564
04:03:38,960 --> 04:03:40,260
The balance of the game was.

4565
04:03:40,880 --> 04:03:43,040
For a $100,000 event.

4566
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:45,920
That's my argument.

4567
04:03:46,200 --> 04:03:47,100
That was despicable.

4568
04:03:48,260 --> 04:03:50,280
To put $70,000 on the line.

4569
04:03:50,420 --> 04:03:51,160
And then make you play that game.

4570
04:03:51,900 --> 04:03:53,160
It's for sure not fair.

4571
04:03:53,700 --> 04:03:55,780
I don't think anyone disagrees with that take.

4572
04:03:57,320 --> 04:03:59,140
All these games we've been playing.

4573
04:03:59,380 --> 04:04:00,640
I go into it just being like.

4574
04:04:00,720 --> 04:04:01,600
I could just randomly.

4575
04:04:01,600 --> 04:04:02,580
Like that curse one.

4576
04:04:02,720 --> 04:04:04,120
I could randomly just spawn with it.

4577
04:04:04,160 --> 04:04:05,420
And everyone just runs away from me.

4578
04:04:05,500 --> 04:04:07,000
What was I supposed to do at that point?

4579
04:04:09,300 --> 04:04:11,000
Now they're doing the doll game.

4580
04:04:11,280 --> 04:04:13,000
Which to me was $70,000.

4581
04:04:13,420 --> 04:04:14,860
I agree 100%.

4582
04:04:14,860 --> 04:04:15,680
It's me!

4583
04:04:17,360 --> 04:04:19,280
The best solution out of all of this.

4584
04:04:19,400 --> 04:04:20,140
It sucks to say.

4585
04:04:20,280 --> 04:04:22,440
Calculate the points of the people who got fucked over.

4586
04:04:22,660 --> 04:04:23,860
And then just move the people on.

4587
04:04:25,340 --> 04:04:26,680
Because at the end of the day.

4588
04:04:26,920 --> 04:04:27,940
I think running it back.

4589
04:04:27,940 --> 04:04:29,280
You guys saw the thing in VC.

4590
04:04:29,500 --> 04:04:32,160
Running it back isn't really the best idea.

4591
04:04:33,580 --> 04:04:36,300
No matter what people are going to be fucked over.

4592
04:04:36,700 --> 04:04:38,600
So I think the best thing you can do.

4593
04:04:39,960 --> 04:04:41,980
The best thing you can do in this situation.

4594
04:04:42,540 --> 04:04:43,780
Is just calculate the points.

4595
04:04:44,000 --> 04:04:44,420
Because obviously.

4596
04:04:46,440 --> 04:04:48,900
I'm in the thick of the Minecraft drama.

4597
04:04:49,300 --> 04:04:50,220
There was bugs right?

4598
04:04:50,340 --> 04:04:50,920
But it's not like.

4599
04:04:51,460 --> 04:04:52,820
The way they make it sound.

4600
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:54,840
It's only one person experienced a bug.

4601
04:04:55,520 --> 04:04:56,900
That is not true.

4602
04:04:57,060 --> 04:04:58,120
I had the checkbook.

4603
04:04:58,260 --> 04:04:59,500
And you all laughed at me.

4604
04:04:59,540 --> 04:05:01,440
Because you thought I fucked up.

4605
04:05:02,980 --> 04:05:04,620
That is not true.

4606
04:05:04,860 --> 04:05:07,100
You all laughed at me.

4607
04:05:08,000 --> 04:05:09,180
The best thing they can do.

4608
04:05:09,700 --> 04:05:10,800
Is just count the scores.

4609
04:05:10,900 --> 04:05:12,360
Get a bunch of people and count the scores.

4610
04:05:12,380 --> 04:05:13,400
I don't agree.

4611
04:05:13,740 --> 04:05:15,100
Because you thought it was possible.

4612
04:05:17,780 --> 04:05:18,740
There's multiple people.

4613
04:05:18,840 --> 04:05:19,180
Like I said.

4614
04:05:19,900 --> 04:05:21,940
If the only argument you are going to listen to.

4615
04:05:21,940 --> 04:05:22,940
Is still the biggest argument.

4616
04:05:23,160 --> 04:05:25,160
There's a fundamental flaw with one of the tasks.

4617
04:05:25,260 --> 04:05:26,240
People couldn't get points.

4618
04:05:26,300 --> 04:05:27,320
Which they need as survivor.

4619
04:05:28,400 --> 04:05:29,700
And therefore they are probably getting eliminated.

4620
04:05:29,980 --> 04:05:30,900
Because they didn't get hunter.

4621
04:05:31,160 --> 04:05:32,260
That is fundamentally just.

4622
04:05:33,300 --> 04:05:34,980
There's nothing to it other than that.

4623
04:05:35,460 --> 04:05:38,140
You have a disadvantage that you literally couldn't do.

4624
04:05:38,980 --> 04:05:39,560
And then you lose.

4625
04:05:40,420 --> 04:05:42,380
And I don't think that's fair for a tournament setting.

4626
04:05:42,540 --> 04:05:43,140
I agree with you.

4627
04:05:43,140 --> 04:05:44,980
Not the same chance of rolling hunter.

4628
04:05:45,500 --> 04:05:47,460
And everybody has the same disadvantage.

4629
04:05:47,460 --> 04:05:48,660
It's not about the hunter.

4630
04:05:48,820 --> 04:05:49,660
It's about the thing not working.

4631
04:05:50,060 --> 04:05:52,600
That's an awful argument to say you had a disadvantage of the thing breaking.

4632
04:05:52,720 --> 04:05:53,800
Some people it worked.

4633
04:05:54,060 --> 04:05:56,280
If it works for some people it should work for everybody.

4634
04:05:56,600 --> 04:05:57,680
So that's a terrible argument.

4635
04:05:58,260 --> 04:06:00,780
I also think that the RNG argument is a bit flawed too.

4636
04:06:00,880 --> 04:06:02,800
Because in this game the RNG is way different.

4637
04:06:02,960 --> 04:06:05,300
Because if you RNG and happen to be a hunter.

4638
04:06:05,540 --> 04:06:06,580
Then now congratulations.

4639
04:06:06,780 --> 04:06:09,440
You can easily rack up 20 to 30 points this round.

4640
04:06:09,560 --> 04:06:11,100
By being a hunter the entire game.

4641
04:06:11,500 --> 04:06:14,320
While other people would never have the opportunity to do that.

4642
04:06:14,380 --> 04:06:15,360
No matter when they die.

4643
04:06:15,360 --> 04:06:16,360
Or when they become a hunter.

4644
04:06:16,580 --> 04:06:20,080
Or how many points they tried to get while they were as a bot.

4645
04:06:20,280 --> 04:06:21,540
You can never get that many points.

4646
04:06:21,540 --> 04:06:23,240
Do I have any Minecraft viewers?

4647
04:06:23,480 --> 04:06:24,980
How long do these arguments last?

4648
04:06:25,240 --> 04:06:26,520
That's the point of the event.

4649
04:06:26,520 --> 04:06:28,320
Because they already sort of figured it out.

4650
04:06:28,880 --> 04:06:30,260
I do understand that argument.

4651
04:06:30,480 --> 04:06:32,100
I do understand.

4652
04:06:33,380 --> 04:06:35,400
The RNG is bad and the game is bad.

4653
04:06:36,260 --> 04:06:37,020
As someone in here.

4654
04:06:38,140 --> 04:06:40,220
How long do these arguments go?

4655
04:06:40,240 --> 04:06:41,240
If it was full skill based.

4656
04:06:41,360 --> 04:06:42,580
I should be in the top 20.

4657
04:06:43,360 --> 04:06:44,220
Sure, whatever.

4658
04:06:45,240 --> 04:06:47,100
I'm not looking forward to playing these games.

4659
04:06:47,280 --> 04:06:49,480
I'm not looking forward to getting random targeted by a doll.

4660
04:06:49,860 --> 04:06:51,100
Random spawn with a curse.

4661
04:06:52,020 --> 04:06:53,340
Random not choosing hunter.

4662
04:06:53,560 --> 04:06:54,700
I didn't get the girl for this.

4663
04:06:56,060 --> 04:06:58,000
It's a mix of RNG and skill.

4664
04:06:58,180 --> 04:07:00,780
People qualified being prop all four times.

4665
04:07:00,960 --> 04:07:02,800
And I guarantee you there were people that were hunter.

4666
04:07:03,100 --> 04:07:03,520
Starting.

4667
04:07:04,400 --> 04:07:05,620
That didn't qualify.

4668
04:07:05,840 --> 04:07:07,560
Starting as hunter and then propping three times.

4669
04:07:07,740 --> 04:07:08,960
I'm willing to guarantee you.

4670
04:07:09,360 --> 04:07:10,660
You'd have to look at a revod.

4671
04:07:10,660 --> 04:07:13,760
There's no statistical way.

4672
04:07:14,160 --> 04:07:14,480
Exactly.

4673
04:07:15,640 --> 04:07:16,080
I would say.

4674
04:07:16,840 --> 04:07:17,320
Honestly.

4675
04:07:17,680 --> 04:07:20,660
I would put money on the fact that whoever got hunter first round.

4676
04:07:20,780 --> 04:07:21,480
Probably made it through.

4677
04:07:22,560 --> 04:07:23,540
That's so true.

4678
04:07:24,020 --> 04:07:26,340
The 90% minimum.

4679
04:07:27,560 --> 04:07:28,980
Didn't you start as hunter first round.

4680
04:07:29,020 --> 04:07:29,540
And have zero points.

4681
04:07:29,740 --> 04:07:32,400
I started as hunter first round and got 20.

4682
04:07:32,480 --> 04:07:33,500
Second round I got zero.

4683
04:07:34,340 --> 04:07:36,160
Third round I got five.

4684
04:07:36,720 --> 04:07:37,700
Last round I got five.

4685
04:07:37,700 --> 04:07:39,220
You started as hunter and got 20 points.

4686
04:07:39,280 --> 04:07:40,320
You started as hunter and got 20.

4687
04:07:40,400 --> 04:07:42,760
You got more points than I got the entire game.

4688
04:07:43,060 --> 04:07:47,360
I was just stealing people's kills.

4689
04:07:47,860 --> 04:07:49,020
Yeah, it's still getting a kill.

4690
04:07:49,940 --> 04:07:51,620
You were still getting kills though.

4691
04:07:51,720 --> 04:07:52,360
Right, exactly.

4692
04:07:53,020 --> 04:07:55,160
And then there's a cooldown for you to get kills.

4693
04:07:55,360 --> 04:07:55,780
Which is awesome.

4694
04:07:56,200 --> 04:07:58,360
There was two rounds I could have got 15 points as the hunter.

4695
04:07:58,440 --> 04:08:00,660
But I only got five because you're on a cooldown for a minute.

4696
04:08:01,160 --> 04:08:02,820
The problem with the hunter conversation.

4697
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:05,380
They should do bed wars right now.

4698
04:08:05,380 --> 04:08:06,880
To settle this.

4699
04:08:07,560 --> 04:08:08,960
This is a bed war settlement.

4700
04:08:10,140 --> 04:08:11,740
At the end of the day we all knew.

4701
04:08:12,140 --> 04:08:13,740
Before the game started that.

4702
04:08:14,320 --> 04:08:15,640
Hunting would be.

4703
04:08:15,700 --> 04:08:17,160
Everyone's best chance of surviving.

4704
04:08:18,280 --> 04:08:20,180
And we just got unlucky.

4705
04:08:20,660 --> 04:08:21,700
And I was annoyed.

4706
04:08:22,580 --> 04:08:23,000
I got unlucky.

4707
04:08:23,000 --> 04:08:23,800
What's the general consensus?

4708
04:08:24,220 --> 04:08:25,180
What should happen?

4709
04:08:27,500 --> 04:08:28,820
Let's just keep it kind of straight.

4710
04:08:28,960 --> 04:08:29,380
More or less.

4711
04:08:29,780 --> 04:08:34,200
90% of the people that were in the 40%.

4712
04:08:34,200 --> 04:08:36,240
Are probably going to be like.

4713
04:08:36,360 --> 04:08:37,700
Yeah, let's just eliminate them.

4714
04:08:37,900 --> 04:08:39,920
And then most of the 90% of the 30 people.

4715
04:08:40,260 --> 04:08:41,020
Are going to say the same thing.

4716
04:08:41,080 --> 04:08:42,400
No, let's just do something again.

4717
04:08:42,860 --> 04:08:43,880
No matter what.

4718
04:08:44,140 --> 04:08:45,160
People are going to be mad.

4719
04:08:45,740 --> 04:08:46,920
Am I on top stream?

4720
04:08:47,620 --> 04:08:49,320
You can reboot the screen.

4721
04:08:52,640 --> 04:08:54,060
That's mad funny bro.

4722
04:08:57,320 --> 04:08:59,120
I'm just here as an outsider.

4723
04:08:59,680 --> 04:09:00,880
I don't even go here.

4724
04:09:00,880 --> 04:09:02,520
I confirmed using it.

4725
04:09:02,520 --> 04:09:04,200
I don't think there is a good solution.

4726
04:09:04,420 --> 04:09:05,300
I'm farming right now.

4727
04:09:05,300 --> 04:09:06,200
That is insane.

4728
04:09:07,620 --> 04:09:09,700
It depends on what the next games are.

4729
04:09:09,820 --> 04:09:11,400
Because I don't think playing the doll game again.

4730
04:09:11,560 --> 04:09:12,700
Is also a good solution.

4731
04:09:13,160 --> 04:09:13,800
No, I agree.

4732
04:09:13,920 --> 04:09:15,820
That's my biggest gripe with the solution.

4733
04:09:16,220 --> 04:09:18,460
I'm like the audience right now.

4734
04:09:18,460 --> 04:09:21,320
I have no idea what's going on in the Minecraft area.

4735
04:09:22,100 --> 04:09:23,720
Apparently this is very common.

4736
04:09:23,720 --> 04:09:25,960
These types of RNG.

4737
04:09:28,620 --> 04:09:31,000
Check me out on YouTube guys.

4738
04:09:31,080 --> 04:09:32,340
I'm a YouTube streamer.

4739
04:09:32,780 --> 04:09:34,040
I don't play Minecraft.

4740
04:09:34,580 --> 04:09:36,600
But I'm checking out on YouTube.

4741
04:09:38,320 --> 04:09:39,960
I'm that random VTuber.

4742
04:09:40,100 --> 04:09:41,140
They called out.

4743
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:42,600
That made it this far.

4744
04:09:45,480 --> 04:09:46,920
That's what comes with it.

4745
04:09:47,100 --> 04:09:48,120
It is what it is.

4746
04:09:48,440 --> 04:09:51,640
I would hate to be eliminated.

4747
04:09:51,640 --> 04:09:52,820
From the game.

4748
04:09:53,020 --> 04:09:55,620
If it came down to me not being able to do the chest twice.

4749
04:09:55,620 --> 04:09:57,280
Even though I was there and had time to do it.

4750
04:09:57,640 --> 04:10:00,200
I think my favorite part is that 5UP made it.

4751
04:10:00,500 --> 04:10:02,540
But he is so mad about the chest part.

4752
04:10:02,640 --> 04:10:03,860
So he is fighting for the people.

4753
04:10:04,160 --> 04:10:07,480
I think that's my favorite.

4754
04:10:07,900 --> 04:10:10,280
If you got scuffed by that lag.

4755
04:10:10,360 --> 04:10:11,160
Or by that glitch.

4756
04:10:11,480 --> 04:10:13,120
Have you send them a clip.

4757
04:10:13,220 --> 04:10:15,040
And then do the calculation based off of that.

4758
04:10:15,380 --> 04:10:18,940
But there is still the fourth round.

4759
04:10:18,940 --> 04:10:20,520
Where people trolled.

4760
04:10:20,580 --> 04:10:21,920
Because they thought it was getting restarted.

4761
04:10:21,980 --> 04:10:24,680
There was only two props left.

4762
04:10:25,200 --> 04:10:27,060
Oh my I should have seen the discord.

4763
04:10:27,400 --> 04:10:28,320
The discord beep.

4764
04:10:28,560 --> 04:10:29,480
The chat beep.

4765
04:10:29,640 --> 04:10:31,160
Was actually crazy.

4766
04:10:32,060 --> 04:10:32,780
It was insane.

4767
04:10:36,920 --> 04:10:40,940
They are so civilized.

4768
04:10:41,740 --> 04:10:42,400
In the voice call.

4769
04:10:43,200 --> 04:10:44,980
But the discord fight.

4770
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:45,460
Was insane.

4771
04:10:45,460 --> 04:10:46,940
When they are typing.

4772
04:10:47,220 --> 04:10:48,120
It was so bad.

4773
04:10:48,560 --> 04:10:50,580
People were actually fighting in the chat.

4774
04:10:52,220 --> 04:10:53,620
Someone literally responded.

4775
04:10:53,940 --> 04:10:55,380
Someone called somebody out.

4776
04:10:55,660 --> 04:10:57,340
And then the person responded.

4777
04:10:57,440 --> 04:10:58,140
With cry.

4778
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:00,680
I was like woah.

4779
04:11:01,620 --> 04:11:01,760
Now.

4780
04:11:02,860 --> 04:11:05,780
We will give you back your normal points.

4781
04:11:05,940 --> 04:11:06,660
And if you would have made it.

4782
04:11:06,720 --> 04:11:07,180
You would have made it.

4783
04:11:07,420 --> 04:11:10,180
If you are trying to make it the most balanced.

4784
04:11:10,780 --> 04:11:12,460
Which I still think is not balanced.

4785
04:11:12,460 --> 04:11:13,360
Because the game is flawed.

4786
04:11:13,820 --> 04:11:16,040
The most balanced would be if you genuinely got it.

4787
04:11:17,480 --> 04:11:17,920
Bugged.

4788
04:11:18,020 --> 04:11:19,480
Either by not getting points for survival.

4789
04:11:19,820 --> 04:11:20,740
Or the chest not working.

4790
04:11:21,180 --> 04:11:22,380
What is going on?

4791
04:11:22,460 --> 04:11:24,420
We are watching a minecraft fight right now.

4792
04:11:24,760 --> 04:11:27,100
We are listening into a minecraft fight.

4793
04:11:27,120 --> 04:11:29,140
Submitting a clip and having them do all the calculations.

4794
04:11:29,400 --> 04:11:32,360
I guess is in theory the most fair way to do it.

4795
04:11:32,600 --> 04:11:32,900
Now.

4796
04:11:34,180 --> 04:11:35,040
It is still not fair.

4797
04:11:35,040 --> 04:11:35,740
I am getting cursed.

4798
04:11:36,060 --> 04:11:37,920
It is a big club.

4799
04:11:39,800 --> 04:11:40,880
This is a minecraft.

4800
04:11:41,860 --> 04:11:43,420
New challenger is here.

4801
04:11:43,480 --> 04:11:45,600
I feel like we still have a good 4 minutes left.

4802
04:11:45,860 --> 04:11:47,620
There was like 2 people alive.

4803
04:11:48,060 --> 04:11:49,080
If you found the person.

4804
04:11:49,600 --> 04:11:50,900
Play the 4th round again.

4805
04:11:51,060 --> 04:11:52,420
You have to play the 4th round again.

4806
04:11:52,520 --> 04:11:53,500
You just could not count that round.

4807
04:11:53,600 --> 04:11:57,000
You only got 100 in the 4th round.

4808
04:11:58,200 --> 04:11:58,920
Stop it.

4809
04:11:59,360 --> 04:11:59,900
Before that round.

4810
04:12:00,180 --> 04:12:01,740
Before they said it.

4811
04:12:01,740 --> 04:12:02,980
Before they announced it.

4812
04:12:02,980 --> 04:12:05,140
Just those 2 people that were left as props.

4813
04:12:05,920 --> 04:12:07,060
They are still going.

4814
04:12:07,200 --> 04:12:08,400
Apparently this lasts for a while.

4815
04:12:09,160 --> 04:12:10,640
I do not know.

4816
04:12:11,000 --> 04:12:12,800
Is this what it feels like to be a reaction channel?

4817
04:12:12,940 --> 04:12:14,700
I am reacting to stuff live.

4818
04:12:15,480 --> 04:12:16,380
I am patient zero.

4819
04:12:17,040 --> 04:12:19,000
I am here.

4820
04:12:19,340 --> 04:12:21,320
I am in the drama.

4821
04:12:23,340 --> 04:12:23,780
Recalculating.

4822
04:12:24,140 --> 04:12:24,600
All people.

4823
04:12:25,060 --> 04:12:26,400
30 people have to get eliminated.

4824
04:12:26,560 --> 04:12:28,100
It is not 30 people going into the doll game.

4825
04:12:28,100 --> 04:12:29,160
30 people have to get eliminated.

4826
04:12:29,640 --> 04:12:32,360
If they change their mind.

4827
04:12:32,500 --> 04:12:34,020
And send the 30 eliminations.

4828
04:12:34,300 --> 04:12:34,840
Into the doll game.

4829
04:12:35,220 --> 04:12:37,040
Did people leak the chat?

4830
04:12:38,500 --> 04:12:39,140
Wait.

4831
04:12:39,920 --> 04:12:41,140
What got leaked?

4832
04:12:43,380 --> 04:12:44,740
Oh my god.

4833
04:12:45,020 --> 04:12:47,760
Are the Latin American streamers mad?

4834
04:12:48,440 --> 04:12:49,180
Oh my god.

4835
04:12:49,200 --> 04:12:50,300
Are they farting?

4836
04:12:50,920 --> 04:12:53,840
Was it a Latin American streamer that called out?

4837
04:12:54,080 --> 04:12:55,420
Oh my god.

4838
04:12:55,420 --> 04:12:56,800
I think the general consensus is.

4839
04:12:56,920 --> 04:12:59,180
I don't like survival.

4840
04:13:00,200 --> 04:13:01,440
And somebody spamming.

4841
04:13:01,800 --> 04:13:03,040
And then.

4842
04:13:03,840 --> 04:13:04,420
Organize finals.

4843
04:13:04,700 --> 04:13:07,000
I finish it.

4844
04:13:07,160 --> 04:13:08,500
I sat there for 30 seconds.

4845
04:13:08,840 --> 04:13:09,980
I can make that.

4846
04:13:10,720 --> 04:13:12,360
I get eliminated.

4847
04:13:13,100 --> 04:13:14,760
Oh my god.

4848
04:13:15,160 --> 04:13:16,060
I can immediately be like.

4849
04:13:16,440 --> 04:13:18,460
I had to sit there for a minute.

4850
04:13:18,580 --> 04:13:19,500
Trying to figure it out.

4851
04:13:20,740 --> 04:13:23,140
I could have been hiding somewhere.

4852
04:13:23,140 --> 04:13:24,520
And someone said.

4853
04:13:24,720 --> 04:13:26,480
Stop being the most annoying.

4854
04:13:27,660 --> 04:13:29,240
Who are you?

4855
04:13:29,260 --> 04:13:29,660
That happens to people.

4856
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:31,220
Who survive.

4857
04:13:32,360 --> 04:13:33,900
We saw that.

4858
04:13:34,020 --> 04:13:35,740
That was one of the streamers top.

4859
04:13:36,460 --> 04:13:37,300
I think it should be obvious.

4860
04:13:37,680 --> 04:13:38,860
That people spam clicks.

4861
04:13:39,420 --> 04:13:40,640
Guys what's the leak?

4862
04:13:42,000 --> 04:13:43,040
Oh my god guys.

4863
04:13:43,900 --> 04:13:44,600
Because that's literally.

4864
04:13:45,600 --> 04:13:47,320
Oh my god.

4865
04:13:47,760 --> 04:13:48,000
Save.

4866
04:13:52,100 --> 04:13:53,940
I almost won that.

4867
04:13:54,820 --> 04:13:55,340
I still.

4868
04:13:56,580 --> 04:13:57,420
A lot of people.

4869
04:13:57,540 --> 04:13:57,900
Are arguing.

4870
04:13:58,880 --> 04:13:59,360
Exactly.

4871
04:14:01,380 --> 04:14:02,440
On one side.

4872
04:14:02,980 --> 04:14:05,000
I don't want to guess, but I am going to guess.

4873
04:14:05,240 --> 04:14:06,400
Sam did you not qualify?

4874
04:14:07,600 --> 04:14:08,700
I got eliminated.

4875
04:14:09,640 --> 04:14:11,220
That's the saddest streamer.

4876
04:14:11,220 --> 04:14:11,900
I am just saying.

4877
04:14:12,280 --> 04:14:13,160
I am not mad at you.

4878
04:14:13,160 --> 04:14:14,340
Obviously, we're going to win.

4879
04:14:14,380 --> 04:14:15,840
I'm not against that game.

4880
04:14:17,480 --> 04:14:19,500
That's why 90% are going to say both sides.

4881
04:14:19,500 --> 04:14:22,000
No, the thing is like you're just saying that.

4882
04:14:22,100 --> 04:14:24,060
I actually don't think the game should be replayed at all.

4883
04:14:24,160 --> 04:14:25,620
I don't think that should happen.

4884
04:14:25,780 --> 04:14:31,600
I don't even know if they should try and do all this shenanigary where they try and fix the eliminations or whatever.

4885
04:14:31,720 --> 04:14:33,300
I don't think that's correct or acceptable.

4886
04:14:33,740 --> 04:14:34,900
You were just saying things with five of them.

4887
04:14:34,940 --> 04:14:36,920
That's why I was like, oh, maybe he's not in.

4888
04:14:37,020 --> 04:14:42,060
What I'm saying is that that game was like fundamentally flawed from the beginning, right?

4889
04:14:42,060 --> 04:14:44,780
There was never going to be a good outcome by playing that game.

4890
04:14:44,840 --> 04:14:47,120
And I think that that was realized by most people round one.

4891
04:14:47,220 --> 04:14:48,320
In my VOD, you can go watch my VOD.

4892
04:14:48,420 --> 04:14:50,560
In round one, I said, okay, so you cannot win as a prop.

4893
04:14:50,660 --> 04:14:51,340
I literally said that.

4894
04:14:51,400 --> 04:14:52,500
You cannot win as the prop.

4895
04:14:53,320 --> 04:14:54,520
You're not going to win as the prop.

4896
04:14:54,620 --> 04:14:56,900
I didn't realize how one-sided it was going to be.

4897
04:14:56,980 --> 04:14:58,300
That's actually crazy.

4898
04:15:01,060 --> 04:15:01,700
Multiple dramas.

4899
04:15:03,140 --> 04:15:03,460
Guys!

4900
04:15:04,340 --> 04:15:06,280
I'm so happy I moved to day three.

4901
04:15:07,020 --> 04:15:07,920
It should not be true.

4902
04:15:08,700 --> 04:15:10,220
It should not be true.

4903
04:15:10,220 --> 04:15:13,700
When there's money on the line or something, you shouldn't do that to people.

4904
04:15:13,700 --> 04:15:14,680
This is what I saw.

4905
04:15:14,840 --> 04:15:15,440
You know what I mean?

4906
04:15:15,940 --> 04:15:17,620
It could have been stopped round one.

4907
04:15:17,920 --> 04:15:18,360
Exactly.

4908
04:15:19,780 --> 04:15:21,500
I'm a day three survivor.

4909
04:15:23,120 --> 04:15:27,140
I think it's a point though where this is very important.

4910
04:15:27,500 --> 04:15:30,580
Where he's saying, you know, the entire event...

4911
04:15:30,580 --> 04:15:31,000
Wait!

4912
04:15:31,200 --> 04:15:31,760
People turning!

4913
04:15:33,300 --> 04:15:34,240
I think it's stupid!

4914
04:15:34,420 --> 04:15:36,380
Oh my God!

4915
04:15:37,200 --> 04:15:37,620
That's crazy!

4916
04:15:38,200 --> 04:15:43,840
At this point, putting us all into the doll game tomorrow, 70 people, is like putting us in a blender.

4917
04:15:44,220 --> 04:15:45,620
Oh my God!

4918
04:15:46,260 --> 04:15:46,500
Right.

4919
04:15:48,060 --> 04:15:49,560
I don't think that's fair.

4920
04:15:49,680 --> 04:15:51,360
I don't think they should do something where...

4921
04:15:51,360 --> 04:15:54,740
10 % of the people that survive this time will probably get eliminated.

4922
04:15:55,720 --> 04:15:56,500
I'm going to be honest.

4923
04:15:56,580 --> 04:16:00,900
If they do the doll game tomorrow and I get eliminated because of it, I'll be pissed.

4924
04:16:01,260 --> 04:16:02,040
Don't worry.

4925
04:16:03,680 --> 04:16:09,740
We can think it's not fair, but it's literally the point of how they designed the event and how they designed the game.

4926
04:16:10,200 --> 04:16:11,700
Bro, people have to turn on the webcam to argue!

4927
04:16:12,480 --> 04:16:16,620
I can't let random VTubers have a chance to argue!

4928
04:16:17,100 --> 04:16:23,440
These games have had significantly more randomness than other potential rivals that have existed right in the past.

4929
04:16:23,600 --> 04:16:25,880
Like the 2021 Minecraft Rivals.

4930
04:16:26,500 --> 04:16:26,720
Right.

4931
04:16:27,000 --> 04:16:28,880
Rivals is always scuffed in RNG.

4932
04:16:29,700 --> 04:16:33,140
The point of this event is the RNG.

4933
04:16:33,140 --> 04:16:37,080
I think you guys are getting mixed up.

4934
04:16:38,140 --> 04:16:39,880
There's multiple different types of RNG.

4935
04:16:40,500 --> 04:16:44,540
All the other events that we've done so far is a different type of RNG to this.

4936
04:16:45,000 --> 04:16:46,680
Yes, I agree 100%.

4937
04:16:46,680 --> 04:16:48,680
It's completely unbalanced RNG.

4938
04:16:48,840 --> 04:16:51,280
It's RNG that everyone is going through, but this is not.

4939
04:16:52,920 --> 04:16:59,580
But if you're in the doll game, there's a group of 30 people running into a hallway and there's a doll in front of it.

4940
04:16:59,580 --> 04:17:00,560
You can still...

4941
04:17:00,560 --> 04:17:05,100
I disagree with that.

4942
04:17:05,180 --> 04:17:07,700
The only part in the doll game that was unfair is the spawn.

4943
04:17:07,880 --> 04:17:10,100
If you were right next to the yellow blonde doll...

4944
04:17:12,840 --> 04:17:14,000
That's insane!

4945
04:17:15,700 --> 04:17:16,280
Bro!

4946
04:17:17,220 --> 04:17:21,680
The fact that staff actually antagonized the Latin American...

4947
04:17:21,680 --> 04:17:27,080
The fact that staff actually antagonized the Spanish speaking streamers...

4948
04:17:27,080 --> 04:17:28,800
That's so crazy!

4949
04:17:29,820 --> 04:17:34,500
Do we revive Red Velvet because he couldn't do anything against that blonde dude?

4950
04:17:34,680 --> 04:17:35,780
Oh my god!

4951
04:17:37,000 --> 04:17:37,640
Bro!

4952
04:17:38,740 --> 04:17:41,300
Did they not learn what happened in Rust?

4953
04:17:43,300 --> 04:17:45,940
Do you guys remember the great Rust wars?

4954
04:17:46,860 --> 04:17:48,520
That was a crazy drama!

4955
04:17:49,220 --> 04:17:50,700
But we're not talking about reviving Red now.

4956
04:17:50,840 --> 04:17:52,080
Oh my god!

4957
04:17:52,700 --> 04:17:54,520
Just give me Rust memories.

4958
04:17:54,520 --> 04:17:58,280
Even with the RNG of today...

4959
04:17:58,280 --> 04:17:59,480
I'll be fully honest.

4960
04:17:59,620 --> 04:18:02,140
I got Hunter round 1 and that obviously gave me a buff.

4961
04:18:02,340 --> 04:18:03,240
What was that?

4962
04:18:03,920 --> 04:18:10,320
There was a similar situation and why Rust is now divided and now different.

4963
04:18:10,740 --> 04:18:15,400
In the past, Rust would invite separate communities together.

4964
04:18:16,080 --> 04:18:19,520
It got really bad for one of them.

4965
04:18:19,600 --> 04:18:22,300
To the point where they don't do that anymore for Rust.

4966
04:18:22,300 --> 04:18:25,260
That's why they don't do Rust Twitch Rivals anymore.

4967
04:18:30,500 --> 04:18:30,980
Yeah,

4968
04:18:35,120 --> 04:18:36,180
the Rust Twitch Rivals.

4969
04:18:36,340 --> 04:18:39,000
This is basically the Rust Twitch Rivals.

4970
04:18:40,160 --> 04:18:40,800
It was stupid.

4971
04:18:41,000 --> 04:18:42,240
I will agree.

4972
04:18:42,480 --> 04:18:45,200
The Hunter thing was just dumb but we all knew it going into it.

4973
04:18:45,540 --> 04:18:51,280
90% of the people here probably had an idea that maybe we should just die right away and just respawn.

4974
04:18:51,740 --> 04:18:56,200
I got 25 of my 30 points from just being...

4975
04:18:56,200 --> 04:18:57,500
I never purposely killed myself.

4976
04:18:57,660 --> 04:19:00,020
I never got to be a Hunter and I still survived.

4977
04:19:00,120 --> 04:19:00,940
I only killed one person.

4978
04:19:00,940 --> 04:19:03,420
Yeah, I never actually killed myself either and I made it fine.

4979
04:19:04,040 --> 04:19:05,000
I did have one round as Hunter.

4980
04:19:05,240 --> 04:19:06,220
It was possible.

4981
04:19:06,240 --> 04:19:08,500
My first round I got was no points and so it was fine.

4982
04:19:08,640 --> 04:19:11,860
Yeah, sure, you gotta be a Hunter but there's people that survive.

4983
04:19:12,700 --> 04:19:17,180
Again, would random VTuber number 13 survive being a Hunter?

4984
04:19:17,620 --> 04:19:19,040
Like a Hider three or four times?

4985
04:19:19,940 --> 04:19:19,960
No.

4986
04:19:25,000 --> 04:19:26,580
Look, I'm not like...

4987
04:19:26,580 --> 04:19:29,900
What I'm gonna say, I don't want everyone to think that I'm saying that I need to change my mind.

4988
04:19:31,840 --> 04:19:33,800
Here's the thing though, I was propped four times, right?

4989
04:19:33,900 --> 04:19:35,540
It was impossible for me to have ever won the game.

4990
04:19:35,700 --> 04:19:36,720
I literally could never win the game.

4991
04:19:36,900 --> 04:19:39,720
The first two rounds I could not get any points because I couldn't run around.

4992
04:19:39,880 --> 04:19:40,900
Oh my god, how could you?

4993
04:19:41,060 --> 04:19:43,380
I'm not just random VTuber number 13.

4994
04:19:43,760 --> 04:19:45,400
I'm random VTuber number one.

4995
04:19:45,400 --> 04:19:46,940
You probably figured the map out better.

4996
04:19:48,060 --> 04:19:49,920
There's probably a bit of a skill difference, right?

4997
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:51,120
You figured the map out better.

4998
04:19:51,380 --> 04:19:54,300
If you were gonna be a Hunter, you would have probably survived.

4999
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:55,180
Right, that's what I'm saying.

5000
04:19:55,320 --> 04:19:57,320
If I'd been a Hunter, I would have definitely survived, bro.

5001
04:19:57,580 --> 04:19:58,360
If I'd got the hunt.

5002
04:19:58,360 --> 04:19:59,000
Yeah, 100%.

5003
04:19:59,900 --> 04:20:00,220
100%.

5004
04:20:00,220 --> 04:20:00,700
I agree.

5005
04:20:00,760 --> 04:20:05,200
What I'm saying is that I don't know, the idea that...

5006
04:20:05,200 --> 04:20:07,260
I also just... the idea that like...

5007
04:20:07,260 --> 04:20:09,380
Bro, who has their webcam on again?

5008
04:20:10,160 --> 04:20:11,900
And then people losing will be upset.

5009
04:20:12,360 --> 04:20:14,980
People that got eliminated today can make the same argument, right?

5010
04:20:15,060 --> 04:20:18,040
Like if you're saying oh, if they redo it tomorrow and then I get eliminated, I'm gonna be mad.

5011
04:20:18,600 --> 04:20:23,940
Then how could you ever say that if somebody said, oh, today's game was complete bull, and they're mad.

5012
04:20:24,120 --> 04:20:26,200
How could you ever disagree with them?

5013
04:20:26,420 --> 04:20:30,020
You're basically agreeing by saying that you would be mad if you got eliminated tomorrow.

5014
04:20:30,040 --> 04:20:30,520
Right, right, right.

5015
04:20:31,340 --> 04:20:33,680
The counter to that kind of is like...

5016
04:20:33,680 --> 04:20:39,860
Like I was saying earlier, besides the glitchy things, we all knew that it was dumb.

5017
04:20:39,860 --> 04:20:44,540
Like we all knew going into the game, the points, how it was gonna run, what points we would get where.

5018
04:20:45,360 --> 04:20:52,700
I agree with the point of like that people that didn't get points because of being buggy is fundamentally the problem.

5019
04:20:52,920 --> 04:20:56,720
That's the number one problem in this whole entire thing, and them calling it early.

5020
04:20:57,540 --> 04:21:13,660
The reason that like, if I was to have lost and whatever, get a second chance, I'd feel like I was lucky because I knew going into the game that I had to just rage that I'd get RNG Hunter, and if I didn't, I'd probably get eliminated.

5021
04:21:13,960 --> 04:21:15,720
Yeah, I mean that's basically what I'm saying.

5022
04:21:15,820 --> 04:21:16,440
Yeah, it's true.

5023
04:21:17,600 --> 04:21:19,960
We can all agree Hunter was bullshit!

5024
04:21:20,400 --> 04:21:23,160
Like, why are we still arguing about this?

5025
04:21:23,520 --> 04:21:26,260
Like, why are we still arguing about Hunter?

5026
04:21:26,580 --> 04:21:29,080
We all know it's bullshit.

5027
04:21:30,040 --> 04:21:33,300
If you did it three times, then you would've been eliminated if it just didn't work for you.

5028
04:21:33,520 --> 04:21:34,900
You would've been at risk.

5029
04:21:34,900 --> 04:21:35,840
That's what I'm saying.

5030
04:21:36,400 --> 04:21:37,660
That's what I'm saying too.

5031
04:21:38,940 --> 04:21:39,680
What's the word?

5032
04:21:40,160 --> 04:21:43,300
If then we were to give people points for that too, right?

5033
04:21:44,300 --> 04:21:52,000
I could literally say the same thing of just being like, oh, I spent 40 seconds doing it, so I could've survived if I had been hiding instead, you know what I mean?

5034
04:21:53,500 --> 04:21:55,060
What's your guys' consensus right now?

5035
04:21:55,620 --> 04:21:55,940
Nothing.

5036
04:21:56,340 --> 04:21:58,900
Is this something that we're...

5037
04:21:58,900 --> 04:21:59,300
Okay.

5038
04:22:00,580 --> 04:22:03,960
What is the consensus after arguing about this?

5039
04:22:06,560 --> 04:22:07,460
Probably not.

5040
04:22:07,720 --> 04:22:09,920
We're just yelling at each other for no reason.

5041
04:22:10,160 --> 04:22:12,280
Unless there's an actual...

5042
04:22:13,500 --> 04:22:14,400
What's the point?

5043
04:22:16,640 --> 04:22:18,160
I just want to know...

5044
04:22:18,160 --> 04:22:23,120
I want you guys to answer some questions for me just because I'm curious, not that this would affect literally anything.

5045
04:22:24,580 --> 04:22:26,640
What is the problem with the doll game?

5046
04:22:27,620 --> 04:22:31,420
The problem with the doll game is if you spawn next to the...

5047
04:22:31,420 --> 04:22:34,660
There are set spawn points when the doll actually spawns itself.

5048
04:22:35,900 --> 04:22:45,760
If you spawned next to that spawn point of the yellow doll or other dolls, it's going to fundamentally seek you and the other people can just run just on spawn points.

5049
04:22:46,200 --> 04:22:46,980
There's nothing you can do.

5050
04:22:47,940 --> 04:22:55,280
If you change the spawn points to where that's where you voted and that's where you were going to start instead of your set spawn, that helps a lot.

5051
04:22:55,440 --> 04:22:57,680
The only flaw then becomes the final round.

5052
04:22:57,680 --> 04:22:59,040
Where does the doll spawn?

5053
04:22:59,280 --> 04:23:00,800
When the entire circle is the same color.

5054
04:23:04,860 --> 04:23:11,500
Let's say the last round is that blonde doll and you happen to be right where it spawns.

5055
04:23:11,620 --> 04:23:14,440
It's just going to immediately speed 20 at you and kill you.

5056
04:23:16,120 --> 04:23:29,300
The problem is too if we do the doll game again and we don't have that blonde one, we will be waiting for three hours for everyone to die because it already took long enough with the other ones and we survive sometimes with the other ones.

5057
04:23:29,640 --> 04:23:37,720
If we don't have that random RNG effect to it, skill will come into a factor and we'll all just survive.

5058
04:23:38,340 --> 04:23:40,120
What if they give you longer grace period?

5059
04:23:41,060 --> 04:23:43,100
Are you Minecrafters?

5060
04:23:43,400 --> 04:23:46,360
Guys, we're getting intel for the next event!

5061
04:23:48,500 --> 04:23:52,020
The problem is it seems like the things don't move.

5062
04:23:52,180 --> 04:23:56,140
They move randomly until they get close enough and then they start hunting.

5063
04:23:57,200 --> 04:24:06,740
If they wait two seconds, we're all going to be sitting in corners for a minute waiting for them to randomly walk into our hallway and then attack us.

5064
04:24:06,980 --> 04:24:11,840
There were multiple rounds during doll game that I'm running at the front of the group.

5065
04:24:11,980 --> 04:24:14,520
I ran into the doll and because of the way the doll A.Y.

5066
04:24:14,580 --> 04:24:19,320
works, you can just turn around immediately and pass your hitbox past someone else's and it will never target you.

5067
04:24:19,320 --> 04:24:29,320
If the doll takes five seconds to hit you, they're so mad that random Vtuber number 13 made it here.

5068
04:24:30,200 --> 04:24:33,700
I don't understand why I got brought up two to three times.

5069
04:24:34,220 --> 04:24:43,440
Bro, I'm sorry for eliminating I'm sorry for eliminating your fellow Minecraft players.

5070
04:24:46,040 --> 04:24:53,660
Why not just put people in that like hot potato game and let like I guess people can't be added to tomorrow.

5071
04:24:56,860 --> 04:24:59,680
I mean, that would basically be the same thing as the one game, right?

5072
04:25:01,620 --> 04:25:03,800
Do you guys know this random Vtuber streams on YouTube?

5073
04:25:09,640 --> 04:25:13,440
At least with hot potato, I can find Feinberg and try and give him a potato all game.

5074
04:25:13,760 --> 04:25:15,020
Oh my god, they're laughing now!

5075
04:25:15,020 --> 04:25:16,540
They're reconnecting!

5076
04:25:17,660 --> 04:25:21,460
The people agree that if they reviewed the vods and added in the points for

5077
04:25:24,580 --> 04:25:29,040
for survival slash Well, I mean, obviously they're going to do that, right?

5078
04:25:29,140 --> 04:25:30,200
Like, obviously they're going to do that.

5079
04:25:30,260 --> 04:25:31,020
Like, that has to be done.

5080
04:25:31,120 --> 04:25:37,780
Like, if there were survival points or a bug or like if people tried to do things They won't do anything about this game if they're just gonna have us all survive tomorrow.

5081
04:25:38,320 --> 04:25:40,820
Obviously, I think we already know that's not happening.

5082
04:25:40,940 --> 04:25:41,960
That's not going to occur.

5083
04:25:42,500 --> 04:25:43,400
That's what they said.

5084
04:25:43,440 --> 04:25:44,800
I don't expect That's what they said right now.

5085
04:25:44,920 --> 04:25:46,600
Right now, that's what I'm planning for.

5086
04:25:46,720 --> 04:25:48,180
That we're playing that game tomorrow.

5087
04:25:48,380 --> 04:25:48,920
That's what I'm planning for.

5088
04:25:48,920 --> 04:25:52,940
And obviously, like, I think the best thing is, like, if that happens, we all just like, accept it.

5089
04:25:53,040 --> 04:25:53,420
Go GG.

5090
04:25:53,520 --> 04:25:54,360
Like, GG go next.

5091
04:25:54,640 --> 04:25:56,220
Oh my god, they're finally accepting it.

5092
04:25:56,280 --> 04:25:58,080
I don't know, like, not have a rift be between us as players.

5093
04:25:59,220 --> 04:26:01,200
That was literally what I said at the end of my stream.

5094
04:26:01,300 --> 04:26:02,640
I was like, at the end of the day like, it's a game.

5095
04:26:02,700 --> 04:26:03,480
We were playing a game.

5096
04:26:03,800 --> 04:26:05,100
Nobody should be mad at anybody.

5097
04:26:05,360 --> 04:26:07,580
Nobody should be, like, hating on other people.

5098
04:26:07,660 --> 04:26:08,400
Like, it's a game.

5099
04:26:08,480 --> 04:26:09,280
Like, we're playing a game.

5100
04:26:09,460 --> 04:26:12,680
Yes, it was definitely dumb, but, I mean, it's just a game.

5101
04:26:12,920 --> 04:26:13,500
Oh my god.

5102
04:26:13,800 --> 04:26:15,260
Oh my god, guys!

5103
04:26:16,180 --> 04:26:17,160
Right, exactly.

5104
04:26:17,760 --> 04:26:20,740
It changes the dynamic when there's 70k online or whatever.

5105
04:26:21,000 --> 04:26:21,080
Friendship wins, guys!

5106
04:26:21,080 --> 04:26:22,880
And then the game is super RNG or whatever.

5107
04:26:23,080 --> 04:26:25,940
It's like, definitely changes the vibe and is very tilting.

5108
04:26:26,320 --> 04:26:27,320
Like, when you feel like you can't do anything.

5109
04:26:27,320 --> 04:26:29,140
We're finally agreeing that it's RNG!

5110
04:26:29,760 --> 04:26:32,080
What I was trying to say earlier, Sam, even though, like, you said you don't care.

5111
04:26:32,160 --> 04:26:34,780
And I'm not saying this now to, like, say that you do care or anything like that.

5112
04:26:35,200 --> 04:26:39,160
It's like, the people that do care that will be eliminated today will be mad.

5113
04:26:39,500 --> 04:26:42,980
And if we switch it, the people that did survive are gonna be mad.

5114
04:26:43,320 --> 04:26:44,200
Not at specific people.

5115
04:26:44,340 --> 04:26:45,380
Like, I'm not mad at anyone here.

5116
04:26:45,880 --> 04:26:48,500
But, like, someone is gonna be mad.

5117
04:26:48,620 --> 04:26:50,860
Guys, we went through a character arc, guys!

5118
04:26:51,000 --> 04:26:53,880
No matter what they choose to do, we're just gonna have to deal with it.

5119
04:26:54,120 --> 04:26:56,800
And if you're pissy, just don't play another Rivals, I guess.

5120
04:26:56,860 --> 04:26:57,200
I don't know.

5121
04:26:58,660 --> 04:27:03,400
Yeah, I mean, 30 people gone to dull RNG or 30 people gone to that game though?

5122
04:27:03,680 --> 04:27:04,440
Right, exactly.

5123
04:27:04,580 --> 04:27:05,500
That's the question, right?

5124
04:27:05,500 --> 04:27:06,580
That's what it comes down to.

5125
04:27:06,760 --> 04:27:11,180
Are we killing 30 people to a game that was the Hunter game or just to Dull game, right?

5126
04:27:11,380 --> 04:27:13,060
They have to kill 30 people.

5127
04:27:13,680 --> 04:27:14,280
Right, I agree.

5128
04:27:14,460 --> 04:27:16,440
I think the Dull game was completely unbalanced the whole time.

5129
04:27:16,520 --> 04:27:17,380
I had a goaded spawn.

5130
04:27:17,460 --> 04:27:22,200
I spawned in green and, like, the Dulls were spawning on the opposite half the entire game, so I just got to run away at the beginning for free.

5131
04:27:22,340 --> 04:27:23,040
I mean, that's just...

5132
04:27:23,040 --> 04:27:29,480
But there's strategy to that, like, if I will agree that I just, like, sent everyone around to Sapnap.

5133
04:27:29,600 --> 04:27:33,660
I was like, Sapnap, just yell at everyone to go on to the other side and listen to him.

5134
04:27:33,660 --> 04:27:38,420
And the Dull always just spawned on the other side because Sapnap just screamed.

5135
04:27:39,740 --> 04:27:44,260
And then, like, that skill to where that's why, like, me and Feinberg didn't have to worry about anything.

5136
04:27:44,340 --> 04:27:45,220
The power of friendship.

5137
04:27:45,480 --> 04:27:46,080
The good ending.

5138
04:27:46,240 --> 04:27:47,400
What a twist.

5139
04:27:47,480 --> 04:27:51,720
If we're talking about, like, unfairness in any game in every single thing, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah.

5140
04:27:52,220 --> 04:27:57,140
Someone like Red would have been unfairly killed because there was just physically nothing they could have done.

5141
04:27:57,140 --> 04:27:58,480
I watched Red's POV.

5142
04:27:58,880 --> 04:28:05,180
He could have gone on the other door because he ran for a more secure door is the only argument I have for that.

5143
04:28:05,580 --> 04:28:06,940
There is a thing he could have done.

5144
04:28:08,160 --> 04:28:11,520
He also didn't find any safe zone just in the area he was running.

5145
04:28:11,940 --> 04:28:14,420
That's the only argument, but there was something he could have done technically.

5146
04:28:15,160 --> 04:28:18,120
And that same thought process is that there could have been other things.

5147
04:28:18,120 --> 04:28:21,900
There was not anything people could have done, technically, for a chest not working.

5148
04:28:22,540 --> 04:28:23,260
Just not doing it.

5149
04:28:23,260 --> 04:28:25,640
They could have gotten more points from the rest of the game.

5150
04:28:25,660 --> 04:28:27,540
I mean, what they could have done is...

5151
04:28:27,540 --> 04:28:29,100
Probably VOD reviewing, guys.

5152
04:28:29,120 --> 04:28:31,840
I told you Minecraft streamers are on a whole other level.

5153
04:28:33,060 --> 04:28:34,020
Especially speedrunners.

5154
04:28:34,220 --> 04:28:35,020
Here's the thing, though.

5155
04:28:36,160 --> 04:28:37,120
Here's the thing, though.

5156
04:28:37,240 --> 04:28:39,620
Is that...

5157
04:28:39,620 --> 04:28:40,620
Yeah, they're VOD reviewing.

5158
04:28:40,860 --> 04:28:42,340
How do they have time to VOD review?

5159
04:28:43,220 --> 04:28:46,720
This guy literally VOD reviewed in the middle of between games.

5160
04:28:48,680 --> 04:28:55,420
The hunter one round, they just probably got a billion points because the spawn time was like one and a half minutes.

5161
04:28:55,420 --> 04:28:56,840
The spawn time should have been consistent.

5162
04:28:56,840 --> 04:28:58,720
The only way to fix the game is this.

5163
04:28:58,940 --> 04:29:00,360
Everyone should have got a turn to be the hunter.

5164
04:29:00,640 --> 04:29:02,820
Everyone should have had turns that they were not the hunter.

5165
04:29:02,920 --> 04:29:04,260
Everyone should have got one turn to be the hunter.

5166
04:29:04,700 --> 04:29:06,040
That way everybody gets a chance to be hunter.

5167
04:29:06,780 --> 04:29:07,600
What's going on?

5168
04:29:07,980 --> 04:29:09,980
We're listening to the Minecraft debate.

5169
04:29:11,180 --> 04:29:14,080
You should just have the same respawn time across all four rounds.

5170
04:29:14,080 --> 04:29:16,540
For those who are FPS gamers, this is a whole new level for us.

5171
04:29:17,320 --> 04:29:18,960
This is how arguments should be.

5172
04:29:19,420 --> 04:29:20,400
Instead of like...

5173
04:29:20,400 --> 04:29:21,960
You have an advantage over the hunter, even.

5174
04:29:22,020 --> 04:29:23,300
Let alone the people who are the props.

5175
04:29:24,640 --> 04:29:26,080
You have a way big advantage.

5176
04:29:26,140 --> 04:29:27,420
I've never experienced this before.

5177
04:29:28,060 --> 04:29:29,000
There's a cooldown timer.

5178
04:29:29,640 --> 04:29:31,880
That's all because there's a cooldown on killing.

5179
04:29:32,180 --> 04:29:33,380
I'm literally in a debate class right now.

5180
04:29:33,780 --> 04:29:35,920
They're being a cooldown for respawning.

5181
04:29:36,200 --> 04:29:44,700
When you spam cooldowns like this into a game, it leads to situations where inherently this terrible gameplay emerges.

5182
04:29:45,040 --> 04:29:47,980
It's civil, but nothing is being agreed upon.

5183
04:29:48,420 --> 04:29:50,520
They probably should have told us about it.

5184
04:29:50,520 --> 04:29:55,660
One of the organizers came in and was like, so what did you guys agree on?

5185
04:29:55,780 --> 04:29:57,680
And then some other guy was like, nothing.

5186
04:29:58,360 --> 04:30:01,600
And I sat here for 40 minutes listening to how to argue.

5187
04:30:02,880 --> 04:30:04,520
I'm trying to hide, right?

5188
04:30:04,620 --> 04:30:07,040
So I have no idea that bro can't kill me right now.

5189
04:30:07,120 --> 04:30:08,220
What I should do is run away.

5190
04:30:08,820 --> 04:30:09,720
I have no idea of that.

5191
04:30:09,820 --> 04:30:12,060
But again, that's part of the game, right?

5192
04:30:12,180 --> 04:30:13,700
That's part of the game is you don't know everything.

5193
04:30:14,100 --> 04:30:15,280
Some people turned their webcams on.

5194
04:30:15,280 --> 04:30:15,980
That was crazy.

5195
04:30:16,740 --> 04:30:17,920
I said that as a joke.

5196
04:30:17,920 --> 04:30:21,380
About how to turn the webcam on, look inside to debate.

5197
04:30:21,880 --> 04:30:23,480
Some people actually did that.

5198
04:30:23,560 --> 04:30:24,640
I was like, oh my god.

5199
04:30:25,260 --> 04:30:26,100
This is serious.

5200
04:30:26,760 --> 04:30:28,540
People were saying, oh, it's one minute and a half.

5201
04:30:28,920 --> 04:30:30,080
We knew that stuff sucked.

5202
04:30:30,660 --> 04:30:32,540
The kill cooldown stuff was stupid.

5203
04:30:32,740 --> 04:30:33,520
We should have known that.

5204
04:30:35,200 --> 04:30:38,060
Everything that was knowledge that we knew.

5205
04:30:38,600 --> 04:30:44,340
Once you've played around, if you figured out all the stuff were in the same spots every single time, that's just knowledge.

5206
04:30:44,340 --> 04:30:49,940
The biggest problem with that game is that people weren't getting points because the thing was buggy.

5207
04:30:50,300 --> 04:30:51,760
Inherently, the only problem.

5208
04:30:52,160 --> 04:30:54,340
If you didn't get Hunter, that RNG starts to be you.

5209
04:30:54,340 --> 04:30:55,300
This feels like a court trial.

5210
04:30:55,340 --> 04:30:57,440
You can still survive if you did this or that.

5211
04:30:59,000 --> 04:31:03,600
But inherently, if you didn't get Hunter, it is LU at that point.

5212
04:31:03,800 --> 04:31:12,960
Every game in this whole entire event and continue to be will probably have some type of dumb RNG that if you don't get it Call me out right now.

5213
04:31:13,220 --> 04:31:15,040
Your head is going to explode.

5214
04:31:15,400 --> 04:31:15,900
I don't know.

5215
04:31:16,400 --> 04:31:16,920
Call me out.

5216
04:31:17,380 --> 04:31:18,320
Call out the random YouTuber.

5217
04:31:18,700 --> 04:31:24,500
The last game to decide who wins this event could be like Oh, does your name start with the letter F?

5218
04:31:24,600 --> 04:31:27,900
Oh, congratulations, you win for $70,000.

5219
04:31:28,840 --> 04:31:30,060
This guy coded it from above.

5220
04:31:30,080 --> 04:31:30,460
You hear that?

5221
04:31:30,640 --> 04:31:32,700
This guy is cheating.

5222
04:31:34,280 --> 04:31:38,140
Inherently, the games coming up too could be problematic too.

5223
04:31:38,440 --> 04:31:40,020
And what are we going to do for every single game?

5224
04:31:40,020 --> 04:31:50,420
I think the only reason that I feel like they need to do something about this game was because everyone knew during round one that the game was just scuffed.

5225
04:31:50,560 --> 04:31:51,860
It was just a scuffed game.

5226
04:31:54,020 --> 04:31:54,960
That's what I'm saying.

5227
04:31:54,980 --> 04:31:59,220
That's what should have happened is the rivals people should have said, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.

5228
04:31:59,560 --> 04:32:02,960
Look at the disparity in the points already after a singular round.

5229
04:32:03,300 --> 04:32:07,860
We know that some people are just getting eliminated basically off round one, round two, automatic.

5230
04:32:08,680 --> 04:32:13,280
Having these people call her events scuffed, I feel so bad.

5231
04:32:13,560 --> 04:32:17,380
She has been listening to this.

5232
04:32:18,840 --> 04:32:19,820
They were in the call.

5233
04:32:20,280 --> 04:32:21,280
They were in the call.

5234
04:32:21,920 --> 04:32:22,660
He dipped out.

5235
04:32:26,160 --> 04:32:32,900
The game is never tested in a way where like, we got 70k on the line.

5236
04:32:34,460 --> 04:32:35,680
I agree with that.

5237
04:32:35,680 --> 04:32:41,700
The fact that there's 70k on the line and the games weren't as well tested as it was.

5238
04:32:42,700 --> 04:32:45,460
Because like, I've had to test games out before.

5239
04:32:46,520 --> 04:32:51,540
The fact that like they didn't test the games enough with the quantity of people.

5240
04:32:51,580 --> 04:33:00,480
Hear me out, Twitch Rivals, if you're hearing this, if Twitch Rivals offered me a job to make sure their events weren't dumb, I would do that than playing this.

5241
04:33:00,600 --> 04:33:01,020
You know what I mean?

5242
04:33:01,880 --> 04:33:02,980
Yeah, but would you do it for free?

5243
04:33:02,980 --> 04:33:06,680
To like, make sure that like their things are fair, and do something like that.

5244
04:33:06,800 --> 04:33:10,480
Offer people 10 bucks to just play their game for an hour, and then give feedback.

5245
04:33:13,120 --> 04:33:15,300
Oh yeah, 100%.

5246
04:33:16,860 --> 04:33:18,200
Twitch Rivals, do you hear that?

5247
04:33:18,700 --> 04:33:20,440
If they weren't gonna do the doll game thing.

5248
04:33:21,660 --> 04:33:23,380
How did more people join back?

5249
04:33:24,100 --> 04:33:25,040
I thought people left.

5250
04:33:25,280 --> 04:33:35,740
Yeah, if they didn't do the doll game, they'd have to give the survival points to people, and then give back the points that people randomly killed their points by punching random things.

5251
04:33:36,500 --> 04:33:39,240
Does everyone agree that that's better than the doll game?

5252
04:33:39,560 --> 04:33:40,940
Yeah, a million percent.

5253
04:33:40,960 --> 04:33:42,780
I'm pretty sure every single person would agree.

5254
04:33:42,900 --> 04:33:45,160
Yeah, well I mean, obviously that game's dumber than the doll game.

5255
04:33:45,520 --> 04:33:45,840
Obviously.

5256
04:33:47,240 --> 04:33:59,140
Someone was just saying like, the fix instead of playing another game tomorrow should just be to have people open a ticket if they genuinely experienced a bug or trolled at the end of the last one after they said it was cancelled.

5257
04:33:59,140 --> 04:34:01,440
That's what I think too.

5258
04:34:02,220 --> 04:34:04,360
That's the only way to do it.

5259
04:34:04,460 --> 04:34:12,620
I think if the staff knew that most people agree on something, they can make a better decision.

5260
04:34:12,820 --> 04:34:23,460
Obviously not to tell them what to do, but I feel like everybody prefers that over the doll game and probably even some people who got eliminated would agree.

5261
04:34:23,720 --> 04:34:24,660
Just give us $500!

5262
04:34:25,320 --> 04:34:26,240
I don't care anymore!

5263
04:34:27,900 --> 04:34:29,960
Calculate those completely bugged points.

5264
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:36,220
To be clear, I don't want to come back tomorrow from whatever, and then I'm one of the people who got eliminated.

5265
04:34:36,340 --> 04:34:38,460
I don't want to come start streaming tomorrow and start playing Rival.

5266
04:34:39,620 --> 04:34:41,720
And then I immediately die.

5267
04:34:42,120 --> 04:34:43,100
I don't understand.

5268
04:34:43,520 --> 04:34:45,780
Because the way they worded it is kind of disambiguous as well.

5269
04:34:45,880 --> 04:34:46,880
And they're discordant about that.

5270
04:34:47,880 --> 04:34:48,680
I agree.

5271
04:34:48,840 --> 04:34:58,460
I think that the only way they can do anything that's remotely fair is to take all of the streams and everyone who says that they didn't get points they should have got and to fix their points and then see who the 30 were or whatever.

5272
04:34:58,660 --> 04:34:59,280
People can lie!

5273
04:34:59,760 --> 04:35:00,800
Oh wait, no, there's clips.

5274
04:35:01,740 --> 04:35:03,940
Then that was how the game should have eliminated you, right?

5275
04:35:04,080 --> 04:35:05,740
So that's just the only fair way.

5276
04:35:05,820 --> 04:35:09,480
It's not fair because people can just say this weird word.

5277
04:35:09,580 --> 04:35:12,940
And the points that people said that they were throwing.

5278
04:35:14,220 --> 04:35:14,840
Sure, yeah.

5279
04:35:15,500 --> 04:35:16,620
You should get those back.

5280
04:35:17,420 --> 04:35:21,200
The only reason they should get those points back is because they said they were rewriting the game.

5281
04:35:21,200 --> 04:35:21,980
Yeah, exactly.

5282
04:35:22,260 --> 04:35:26,420
If they say they're rewriting the game, then everything is up in the air at that point, basically.

5283
04:35:26,620 --> 04:35:30,880
I stopped nobbing as a hunter because I thought it was over.

5284
04:35:31,700 --> 04:35:32,880
So that should have been 5 points.

5285
04:35:33,300 --> 04:35:34,700
My chest was broken!

5286
04:35:35,380 --> 04:35:36,300
That's another 5 points.

5287
04:35:37,360 --> 04:35:38,880
That's 10 points right there.

5288
04:35:41,500 --> 04:35:43,780
If they only had 5 points, you know what I mean?

5289
04:35:44,300 --> 04:35:45,500
Bro, that's 10 points!

5290
04:35:45,780 --> 04:35:46,900
I stopped nobbing!

5291
04:35:47,120 --> 04:35:48,700
I stopped nobbing, you guys!

5292
04:35:48,700 --> 04:35:49,880
You were all there!

5293
04:35:53,860 --> 04:35:59,620
There might be someone that was The chest was broken, I got laughed at by my chat.

5294
04:35:59,900 --> 04:36:12,760
I should get 15 points to justify my mental To justify my mental deterioration from my chat laughing at me because I thought I fucked up.

5295
04:36:12,920 --> 04:36:15,340
I deserve 15 points for that.

5296
04:36:16,740 --> 04:36:21,620
I thought I was so stupid that I couldn't turn the chest.

5297
04:36:23,740 --> 04:36:29,180
And I saw my chat laughing at me that I couldn't open the chest.

5298
04:36:30,640 --> 04:36:34,060
At the end of the day, none of us can get mad at each other.

5299
04:36:34,580 --> 04:36:39,540
If Rival decides to do a doll game, we shut our mouths and just play the doll game.

5300
04:36:39,720 --> 04:36:42,700
If they eliminate 30 people, if you get eliminated, you survive.

5301
04:36:43,960 --> 04:36:45,760
Fine, 5 day event starting tomorrow.

5302
04:36:45,920 --> 04:36:47,280
Fine, just start it over.

5303
04:36:47,880 --> 04:36:49,380
What was the point of this argument?

5304
04:36:49,960 --> 04:36:53,140
If we're just gonna settle with what was originally agreed upon.

5305
04:36:53,520 --> 04:36:55,280
No one should get mad at each other.

5306
04:36:55,800 --> 04:36:57,620
Us players should get mad at each other.

5307
04:36:57,840 --> 04:37:02,640
The only person to be frustrated at is the people who allowed the game to be played like that.

5308
04:37:03,840 --> 04:37:05,680
That's exactly what I said at the end of my stream as well.

5309
04:37:05,920 --> 04:37:06,840
Nobody should be upset.

5310
04:37:07,260 --> 04:37:11,700
If we did the doll game tomorrow, and I get eliminated, I'd be pretty mad.

5311
04:37:11,700 --> 04:37:13,780
It always will be an issue with Rivals.

5312
04:37:13,880 --> 04:37:14,700
I understand.

5313
04:37:15,700 --> 04:37:16,740
Nothing happened.

5314
04:37:18,040 --> 04:37:18,940
They just argued.

5315
04:37:18,940 --> 04:37:20,540
This is always an inherent issue with them.

5316
04:37:20,880 --> 04:37:24,040
They just argued for the sake of arguing.

5317
04:37:25,160 --> 04:37:26,760
It just went with their original intent.

5318
04:37:27,440 --> 04:37:32,940
Having any pieces of RNG and random factors that could boost a random player to do better.

5319
04:37:32,940 --> 04:37:34,720
What kind of drops is there for Minecraft?

5320
04:37:34,720 --> 04:37:38,660
The problem with that is that inherently for money, we all want to try our best.

5321
04:37:38,660 --> 04:37:40,240
Oh, another thing I just learned.

5322
04:37:40,380 --> 04:37:41,620
I don't even know if this conversation is still going.

5323
04:37:41,680 --> 04:37:42,040
Sorry to interrupt.

5324
04:37:44,600 --> 04:37:46,320
The Hunters, this wasn't said in the rules.

5325
04:37:46,640 --> 04:37:49,700
The Hunters, if you kill a person, you were at a minute cooldown where you couldn't kill anybody.

5326
04:37:50,040 --> 04:37:50,900
Yeah, we already talked about that.

5327
04:37:52,880 --> 04:37:55,460
If there was multiple rounds, I would have gotten like 15 points.

5328
04:37:55,580 --> 04:37:56,360
There was two rounds in a row.

5329
04:37:57,860 --> 04:38:00,800
I don't know why that wouldn't be...

5330
04:38:01,540 --> 04:38:03,040
They should have said that in the rules.

5331
04:38:03,100 --> 04:38:08,400
Well, in round one, I already said I was getting stood on by a guy that was on kill cooldown and I had no idea.

5332
04:38:10,140 --> 04:38:17,580
That chest with the key, there was just one of them standing in front of there and I was like, I'm going to get these five points just to get these five points and if he kills me afterwards, oh well.

5333
04:38:18,140 --> 04:38:19,420
And he just looked at me.

5334
04:38:19,660 --> 04:38:21,180
And I was like, alright, my guy.

5335
04:38:22,260 --> 04:38:23,420
Like, thanks, I guess.

5336
04:38:23,620 --> 04:38:24,200
Alright, bye.

5337
04:38:24,560 --> 04:38:25,080
And I left.

5338
04:38:25,440 --> 04:38:33,060
Once I realized that I killed someone and I had kill cooldown, I realized that now that guy probably just literally couldn't kill me.

5339
04:38:33,060 --> 04:38:33,900
Yeah.

5340
04:38:35,980 --> 04:38:36,760
But that's a...

5341
04:38:36,760 --> 04:38:37,920
They should have put that in the rules.

5342
04:38:38,660 --> 04:38:41,120
That's really weird that they didn't add the cooldown stuff to the rules.

5343
04:38:41,400 --> 04:38:47,960
But inherently, that was a part of the game and that's like, I mean, sucks to be you if you could have gotten a triple combo.

5344
04:38:48,880 --> 04:38:49,660
I guess.

5345
04:38:51,220 --> 04:38:52,180
Jesus Christ.

5346
04:38:52,400 --> 04:39:00,960
I thought the hitboxes were cooked or something and then after round three, I realized, oh, there's just a cooldown.

5347
04:39:00,960 --> 04:39:03,340
I didn't see it, but there is.

5348
04:39:03,540 --> 04:39:10,780
Yeah, I mean, I think that the number one mistake is a classic Twitch Rivals move and the number one mistake is that at the end of the game, they said that they were going to redo the game, which they should not have.

5349
04:39:11,180 --> 04:39:15,140
The fact that they said before the game ended that they were going to redo things...

5350
04:39:15,140 --> 04:39:16,580
Classic Rivals move.

5351
04:39:16,780 --> 04:39:24,660
My immediate thought, even though I was a hunter every single time, because I was like, going into the third... end of the third round, I was still... I never was a hunter.

5352
04:39:25,140 --> 04:39:28,960
I was out of the bottom 30 and I was like, perfect, I'm surviving, cool, whatever.

5353
04:39:29,440 --> 04:39:34,940
And then I did my two challenges and then I was like, okay, I'm at 30 points, awesome, I think I'll be fine.

5354
04:39:35,120 --> 04:39:38,820
And then immediately when they said, oh yeah, by the way, did something count?

5355
04:39:38,900 --> 04:39:43,040
I was immediately like, well, I was probably going to survive and now I'm not.

5356
04:39:46,640 --> 04:39:52,940
Again, I mean, if they end up choosing to do whatever they want tomorrow, that's their choice and whatever.

5357
04:39:53,080 --> 04:39:57,340
And if I lose in the doll game tomorrow, if they end up doing that, I mean...

5358
04:39:57,340 --> 04:40:00,760
Oh well, you know, GG, I guess.

5359
04:40:01,280 --> 04:40:05,920
No, for 50 minutes, everybody just accepted it.

5360
04:40:10,460 --> 04:40:11,840
Did everyone have fun today?

5361
04:40:12,900 --> 04:40:14,300
Yeah, it was fun.

5362
04:40:14,400 --> 04:40:16,380
I like to hang out with all my friends.

5363
04:40:17,380 --> 04:40:19,940
It was so fun to play, even if it didn't really function all that well.

5364
04:40:20,840 --> 04:40:26,560
I've never been more stressed in a Minecraft event ever in my life before playing this dumb, stupid, stinky event.

5365
04:40:30,580 --> 04:40:34,120
Bro, did we just go through the 5 stages of grief for Minecraft players?

5366
04:40:34,640 --> 04:40:37,880
Did Minecraft players just go through the stages of grief?

5367
04:40:38,400 --> 04:40:39,760
Bro, what was the point?

5368
04:40:41,000 --> 04:40:42,780
What was the point of this?

5369
04:40:42,800 --> 04:40:46,400
Like I said earlier, there's never going to be an answer at least that makes everyone happy.

5370
04:40:46,680 --> 04:40:51,160
There will be 5, 10, 20 people on either side that will be pissed tomorrow.

5371
04:40:51,660 --> 04:40:53,020
Or whenever they make their final decision.

5372
04:40:53,760 --> 04:40:55,460
They've hit the acceptance stage.

5373
04:40:59,700 --> 04:41:01,720
Acceptance has been reached.

5374
04:41:02,240 --> 04:41:04,040
If it works in your favor, if it doesn't.

5375
04:41:05,020 --> 04:41:13,160
Automatically, what ends up happening, whenever there's a problem, immediately the people that were going to get eliminated are going to be like, yes, please, do it again.

5376
04:41:13,700 --> 04:41:17,140
And then the people that survived are obviously going to be like, no, please don't.

5377
04:41:17,260 --> 04:41:19,540
Like, I want to win 70 grand.

5378
04:41:19,880 --> 04:41:22,400
Bro, no, I just wanted $500.

5379
04:41:23,660 --> 04:41:30,980
You got to think about like, inherently what the idea of this whole entire event was supposed to be.

5380
04:41:33,360 --> 04:41:37,260
like Are you sure for D4?

5381
04:41:37,800 --> 04:41:41,280
Like that we're trying to do that one code thing.

5382
04:41:42,600 --> 04:41:44,480
Ended up trying to do it all four rounds.

5383
04:41:44,840 --> 04:41:45,860
That's kind of on them.

5384
04:41:46,100 --> 04:41:47,440
No offense, that's kind of on them.

5385
04:41:47,560 --> 04:41:48,300
I'm not saying they did.

5386
04:41:48,300 --> 04:41:50,400
I just thought it was stupid.

5387
04:41:52,300 --> 04:41:53,100
Or you thought it was broken.

5388
04:41:53,280 --> 04:41:54,560
Why are you doing it more than once?

5389
04:41:55,000 --> 04:41:56,740
I didn't know, I just thought it hit.

5390
04:41:56,760 --> 04:42:00,440
If those people, if they got five extra points and survived, I'd be like, yeah.

5391
04:42:01,140 --> 04:42:02,180
Like, I'd be upset.

5392
04:42:02,580 --> 04:42:11,580
But if they had like zero points going into the last round, or like zero points just in general, you were going to get out even if you did do that four times.

5393
04:42:11,860 --> 04:42:12,500
Like, you know what I mean?

5394
04:42:14,560 --> 04:42:14,860
Damn.

5395
04:42:14,860 --> 04:42:15,020
Damn.

5396
04:42:17,240 --> 04:42:17,940
That's not me.

5397
04:42:19,960 --> 04:42:21,920
I don't know, my chat laughed at me.

5398
04:42:22,800 --> 04:42:28,520
If people survived five minutes and didn't get points for that too, they should get those points and then calculate, see what they get.

5399
04:42:28,740 --> 04:42:31,360
And if people survived because of it, W.

5400
04:42:31,960 --> 04:42:35,620
If you don't, you probably wouldn't have survived anyways.

5401
04:42:38,320 --> 04:42:38,720
Wow.

5402
04:42:39,120 --> 04:42:40,520
I mean, he's not wrong.

5403
04:42:40,740 --> 04:42:42,300
I am surprised I made it this far.

5404
04:42:43,460 --> 04:42:45,260
I'm surprised I got it here.

5405
04:42:45,260 --> 04:42:52,160
That just means tomorrow we get to play three games if we play the dog game.

5406
04:42:52,560 --> 04:42:54,340
Hey, isn't that fun?

5407
04:42:54,960 --> 04:42:55,260
Yay.

5408
04:42:57,580 --> 04:43:00,020
Guys, my voice still messed up.

5409
04:43:01,180 --> 04:43:02,660
What do you think?

5410
04:43:03,580 --> 04:43:04,740
Sorry, I'll meet up again.

5411
04:43:05,280 --> 04:43:05,620
Okay.

5412
04:43:05,880 --> 04:43:07,600
You don't have to meet up.

5413
04:43:08,260 --> 04:43:09,040
No, please do.

5414
04:43:09,040 --> 04:43:10,300
I don't want to hear you.

5415
04:43:13,440 --> 04:43:15,780
I've been sick for the past three days.

5416
04:43:16,240 --> 04:43:18,020
Alright, guys, I think debate's over.

5417
04:43:18,920 --> 04:43:21,440
Do you think the debate is over?

5418
04:43:23,640 --> 04:43:25,260
Can we leave now?

5419
04:43:28,180 --> 04:43:29,280
Hey, game's game.

5420
04:43:32,180 --> 04:43:32,680
Wow.

5421
04:43:33,480 --> 04:43:34,500
Bro, what?

5422
04:43:35,140 --> 04:43:38,040
Bro, that was that was crazy.

5423
04:43:38,340 --> 04:43:40,820
That's actually crazy.

5424
04:43:41,380 --> 04:43:44,460
During the entire time, I ordered soup.

5425
04:43:44,600 --> 04:43:45,600
I ordered a sandwich.

5426
04:43:47,980 --> 04:43:51,020
I caught a genesect on Poke Road.

5427
04:43:51,460 --> 04:43:53,100
Bro, I was just listening in.

5428
04:43:53,200 --> 04:43:55,020
That was actually insane.

5429
04:43:55,480 --> 04:43:57,660
Does this happen often in Minecraft?

5430
04:43:59,980 --> 04:44:01,380
Girl, I don't fucking know.

5431
04:44:03,100 --> 04:44:13,660
Bro, the fact that they debated for more than an hour straight, but then they had zero, it just went back in a circle.

5432
04:44:14,140 --> 04:44:15,760
They agreed to nothing.

5433
04:44:16,720 --> 04:44:18,320
They actually, they just accepted.

5434
04:44:18,340 --> 04:44:19,060
That was crazy.

5435
04:44:19,900 --> 04:44:29,780
There was one part I did tune back in and then I heard Fyva say some shit like, guys, actually there was something they did tell us that's for Hunters that Hunters had a one minute cooldown.

5436
04:44:30,160 --> 04:44:32,240
And everyone in Unison said we talked about that.

5437
04:44:32,240 --> 04:44:34,500
That's so true, yeah.

5438
04:44:35,120 --> 04:44:37,300
Yeah, that was so true.

5439
04:44:37,580 --> 04:44:38,920
That was so fucking funny.

5440
04:44:39,060 --> 04:44:40,320
Oh my god.

5441
04:44:41,860 --> 04:44:44,020
That was actually crazy.

5442
04:44:44,740 --> 04:44:46,340
I was so surprised.

5443
04:44:46,740 --> 04:44:50,380
I was like, what am I listening to?

5444
04:44:50,920 --> 04:44:52,120
Oh my god.

5445
04:44:52,140 --> 04:44:54,660
Everyone in Unison, they already told us.

5446
04:44:54,720 --> 04:44:55,860
Oh my god.

5447
04:44:56,540 --> 04:44:58,580
Did you see the fight?

5448
04:44:58,580 --> 04:45:01,740
Did you see the tweets they linked?

5449
04:45:01,960 --> 04:45:02,880
That was linked to us?

5450
04:45:03,240 --> 04:45:03,520
Yeah.

5451
04:45:04,120 --> 04:45:07,080
I can't believe the Discord got leaked.

5452
04:45:08,420 --> 04:45:10,360
They leaked it on stream.

5453
04:45:10,620 --> 04:45:11,540
Did you know that?

5454
04:45:12,380 --> 04:45:13,740
Yeah, I saw that shit.

5455
04:45:14,160 --> 04:45:20,480
Bro, they actually, we're talking about the callouts, the Discord fight.

5456
04:45:20,660 --> 04:45:22,080
The Discord chat fight.

5457
04:45:22,580 --> 04:45:26,720
And people were leaking the chat logs on stream.

5458
04:45:26,720 --> 04:45:29,120
Not us, we're just telling you guys.

5459
04:45:29,600 --> 04:45:33,320
We didn't call out who it was, but we were just like, oh my god, people are fighting.

5460
04:45:34,400 --> 04:45:43,880
Some people were actually, some streamers that were participating in this Twitch Rivals actually leaked the Discord chat logs on stream.

5461
04:45:44,580 --> 04:45:46,300
It was crazy.

5462
04:45:52,700 --> 04:45:53,100
Man.

5463
04:45:54,280 --> 04:45:56,360
Bro, I'm glad we made it to day three, Goomy.

5464
04:45:56,360 --> 04:45:57,700
We would've missed out.

5465
04:45:58,280 --> 04:45:58,760
Yeah.

5466
04:45:58,940 --> 04:46:01,680
Are you coming back for day four?

5467
04:46:02,600 --> 04:46:03,900
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

5468
04:46:04,200 --> 04:46:05,640
Let's play the dog game again.

5469
04:46:06,300 --> 04:46:07,360
I'm gonna win.

5470
04:46:09,780 --> 04:46:12,560
It has to be the dog game.

5471
04:46:13,280 --> 04:46:15,580
That was like one of the most stressful ones.

5472
04:46:18,520 --> 04:46:19,620
It'll be okay.

5473
04:46:19,860 --> 04:46:20,360
We're gonna win.

5474
04:46:21,420 --> 04:46:25,420
I'll see you on day four, Goomy.

5475
04:46:26,520 --> 04:46:27,520
Wait, what?

5476
04:46:28,340 --> 04:46:28,680
What?

5477
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:29,680
What?

5478
04:46:30,980 --> 04:46:33,100
I'll see you on day four, Goomy.

5479
04:46:34,260 --> 04:46:35,760
Goomy, I just went through.

5480
04:46:39,480 --> 04:46:43,200
Goomy, the stream could've ended two hours ago.

5481
04:46:50,940 --> 04:46:51,900
Vtuber number 13?

5482
04:46:52,380 --> 04:46:53,360
Hey, that's me.

5483
04:46:53,560 --> 04:46:55,700
I kept getting called out like three times.

5484
04:46:56,160 --> 04:47:02,460
I feel like they're like this Vtuber should not have made it this far but because of RNG.

5485
04:47:03,860 --> 04:47:05,340
She's here too.

5486
04:47:08,300 --> 04:47:09,820
That was so fucking good.

5487
04:47:09,820 --> 04:47:12,160
They mentioned you like multiple times.

5488
04:47:12,540 --> 04:47:14,800
What the fuck did I do?

5489
04:47:15,360 --> 04:47:17,980
I'm sorry I got in because of RNG.

5490
04:47:24,420 --> 04:47:25,860
She eliminated.

5491
04:47:34,480 --> 04:47:36,040
I'm gonna talk to my chat.

5492
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:38,740
Goomy, please.

5493
04:47:38,960 --> 04:47:40,740
I'll play Valorant tomorrow, Goomy.

5494
04:47:40,740 --> 04:47:41,840
Okay!

5495
04:47:42,640 --> 04:47:43,180
Bye, Goomy!

5496
04:47:43,400 --> 04:47:45,140
Bye-bye!

5497
04:47:46,780 --> 04:47:48,280
Alright, guys.

5498
04:47:49,100 --> 04:47:50,580
Alright, that was wild.

5499
04:47:50,820 --> 04:47:51,920
That was actually wild.

5500
04:47:52,140 --> 04:47:56,320
I did not expect today's Minecraft day to be like this.

5501
04:47:56,820 --> 04:47:58,580
I did not expect.

5502
04:47:59,540 --> 04:48:00,400
Day four.

5503
04:48:00,720 --> 04:48:03,640
We're back with day four.

5504
04:48:03,640 --> 04:48:03,980
No way.

5505
04:48:08,280 --> 04:48:10,340
Oh my god.

5506
04:48:11,220 --> 04:48:12,740
I can't believe it.

5507
04:48:12,800 --> 04:48:15,700
There's multiple fights going on right now.

5508
04:48:15,820 --> 04:48:22,820
And I'm just like this random Vtuber number 13 looking in the sidelines being like what the hell is going on?

5509
04:48:23,220 --> 04:48:24,720
What the fuck is...

5510
04:48:25,540 --> 04:48:28,900
Zap is trending on Twitter because of the leaks.

5511
04:48:31,300 --> 04:48:37,560
We listened in to a fucking Minecraft debate for an hour.

5512
04:48:37,840 --> 04:48:39,050
Oh my god.

5513
04:48:40,580 --> 04:48:46,400
Also, I only streamed the call because everybody else was streaming the call anyway.

5514
04:48:46,640 --> 04:48:47,520
So I was like, alright.

5515
04:48:50,980 --> 04:48:52,780
Oh my god.

5516
04:48:53,640 --> 04:48:54,920
That was crazy.

5517
04:48:56,060 --> 04:48:58,360
It was pretty civilized though.

5518
04:48:58,760 --> 04:49:03,880
It was pretty civilized though for a debate about a game.

5519
04:49:04,280 --> 04:49:08,300
I think my favorite part was when they ended it with like did you guys have fun?

5520
04:49:08,580 --> 04:49:10,800
After people were like mad.

5521
04:49:11,180 --> 04:49:12,360
Did you guys have fun?

5522
04:49:19,500 --> 04:49:21,120
Oh my god.

5523
04:49:21,280 --> 04:49:25,560
For those who are new here, welcome to my channel.

5524
04:49:25,820 --> 04:49:27,540
We're not a drama channel.

5525
04:49:27,540 --> 04:49:28,980
We just got roped in.

5526
04:49:29,160 --> 04:49:31,140
I'm literally not a Minecraft player.

5527
04:49:31,380 --> 04:49:35,300
I got invited to the Minecraft Twitch Rivals and I was like, that's fun.

5528
04:49:35,660 --> 04:49:42,720
I think I'm one of the few streamers that are not part of the Minecraft community that's made it this far.

5529
04:49:43,080 --> 04:49:46,180
That's still in it because there's not a lot of us left.

5530
04:49:46,820 --> 04:49:48,920
There's definitely not a lot of us left.

5531
04:49:54,480 --> 04:49:57,080
By the way, please check me out on YouTube.

5532
04:49:57,340 --> 04:50:01,260
I usually stream on Twitch when it comes to Twitch events which was this event.

5533
04:50:01,440 --> 04:50:02,680
That's why I'm here.

5534
04:50:05,380 --> 04:50:06,760
That's why I'm here.

5535
04:50:07,400 --> 04:50:10,460
Check me out on YouTube.

5536
04:50:11,000 --> 04:50:12,660
You guys want to know when I stream on Twitch?

5537
04:50:13,020 --> 04:50:18,900
It'll be like tomorrow at 12pm same time.

5538
04:50:18,900 --> 04:50:23,100
I will be on I would usually tweet out whenever

5539
04:50:26,520 --> 04:50:28,200
I'm streaming on Twitch.

5540
04:50:28,340 --> 04:50:29,400
So please follow me on Twitter.

5541
04:50:29,680 --> 04:50:33,020
I heard that my YouTube's figure is up now.

5542
04:50:33,200 --> 04:50:34,760
I don't know if it's up for pre-order now.

5543
04:50:35,220 --> 04:50:38,320
I don't know if my mod has made a command for it or anything.

5544
04:50:38,840 --> 04:50:41,600
But yes, I will tweet out the announcement for my YouTube's figure.

5545
04:50:42,260 --> 04:50:44,700
It came out during the middle of all of this.

5546
04:50:45,060 --> 04:50:46,120
So I couldn't.

5547
04:50:46,120 --> 04:50:48,380
Oh, it opens for pre-orders on the 11th.

5548
04:50:48,440 --> 04:50:50,560
Sorry, it opens for pre-orders on the 11th.

5549
04:50:50,880 --> 04:50:52,400
So yeah, I'll tweet that out later.

5550
04:50:52,820 --> 04:50:55,500
Sorry, in the midst of all this drama I couldn't.

5551
04:50:55,960 --> 04:50:56,840
It's Minecraft drama.

5552
04:50:56,920 --> 04:50:58,620
The thing is, it's Minecraft drama.

5553
04:50:59,060 --> 04:51:07,560
The thing about Minecraft drama is that there's drama almost every week to the point where people are going to forget about it so soon.

5554
04:51:07,940 --> 04:51:12,340
I swear, even somebody who's not even part of the Minecraft community, I always see Minecraft drama.

5555
04:51:12,740 --> 04:51:16,860
So I feel like there's always stuff happening.

5556
04:51:19,660 --> 04:51:25,020
There's always stuff happening, so like I'm not surprised.

5557
04:51:27,410 --> 04:51:29,580
So yeah, that was like...

5558
04:51:29,580 --> 04:51:30,500
That was fun.

5559
04:51:35,910 --> 04:51:38,690
That was fun.

5560
04:51:41,290 --> 04:51:43,550
Anyway, guys.

5561
04:51:43,890 --> 04:51:45,170
Yeah, had a great time.

5562
04:51:45,270 --> 04:51:47,230
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

5563
04:51:47,850 --> 04:51:48,570
Posture check.

5564
04:51:48,890 --> 04:51:51,290
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5565
04:51:51,410 --> 04:51:55,130
And if you stay up for me, head to bed cause you deserve it.

5566
04:51:55,430 --> 04:51:56,970
What a rest week, guys.

5567
04:51:57,510 --> 04:51:59,510
What a rest week.

5568
04:52:02,270 --> 04:52:05,830
The people on YouTube sure are missing out right now.

5569
04:52:06,550 --> 04:52:08,670
Did not expect Minecraft drama.

5570
04:52:08,670 --> 04:52:12,010
I ran for this event to lead this way.

5571
04:52:12,310 --> 04:52:13,130
Hey, guys.

5572
04:52:13,290 --> 04:52:14,530
See you guys next time, everybody.

5573
04:52:14,950 --> 04:52:15,930
Bye, guys.

5574
04:52:16,350 --> 04:52:16,990
Bye!
