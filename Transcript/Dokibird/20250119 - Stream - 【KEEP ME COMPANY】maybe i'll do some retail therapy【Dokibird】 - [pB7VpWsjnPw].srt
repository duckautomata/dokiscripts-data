Yeah It is tradition.

28
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:25,610
No, I swear to God like I I ventured out of my I ventured out of my YouTube bubble and then this we got into twitch drama and then we were like laughing at twitch drama and then I I Ventured out.

29
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:53,430
I was like, let me explore on twitch for the two weeks for two weeks I was only on twitch regularly for two weeks and I somehow got into one of the biggest twitch Not the one of the biggest it wasn't even long live stream fell cuz they don't give a fuck But like I somehow got into a 2025 first one No second twitch drama there's pirate software the second twitch drama of the year Two weeks out of my youtube bubble and now I'm here now

30
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,790
I am not in the Twitch Rivals, and I don't know if I'll ever be participating in future Twitch Rivals.

31
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,730
I know it's weird, I like, suddenly just burned that bridge down, but like, I don't know, I was really upset with what happened.

32
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,770
And like, with what happened in the end, because I did try to take precautions to like, I was like, Are you sure?

33
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,290
Like, do we need to change teammates?

34
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,930
Like, for the last week, I was like, messaging, asking Twitch staff, like, what's going on?

35
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,570
And they're like, nothing is going on.

36
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,430
It's all just rumors.

37
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,010
So then like, I was like, okay.

38
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,070
And then I was like, live blogging it to you guys too, during pre-chat as well, while this was happening.

39
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,970
And a lot of these rumors were going on, and I don't know, I don't know if I'm actually gonna burn that bridge, I don't know.

40
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:57,250
Because like, right now, like, I... Because like, you guys have seen my history and journey with Twitch rivals.

41
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:07,370
And like, I've been in some incredibly unfair Twitch rivals, but I've never like, I've just sucked it up, like...

42
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,250
Like, and then like, I just laugh it off.

43
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,250
I was lied to about some Twitch rivals, where I thought they would be casual.

44
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,970
Casual, but they're not.

45
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:24,370
They're like, actual, like, teams stack their... Teams stack their players.

46
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,290
So like, but I've always sucked it up, and just be like, oh well, free money, ha ha ha.

47
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:37,630
And so like, and then like, when I made my team, I already saw that teams were already big.

48
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,530
This was the first time, because I was really passionate about this game.

49
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,990
I was very passionate about Marvel Rivals.

50
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:50,810
And um, and I was like, I really wanted to know what the competition is like, because I actually really want to do really well in it.

51
00:07:51,070 --> 00:08:00,190
Because so, before I even gave them my team, the team I wanted to join with, I asked them for a teams list.

52
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,990
Like, what other players were doing.

53
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:09,250
So I know if this is a competitive, or if it was like, actual just content creators.

54
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:15,690
And then obviously, I saw the teams list of those who have already confirmed their teams, or like...

55
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,710
Who like, and then I've heard about what, like, captains who haven't yet confirmed their teams with staff.

56
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,810
But like, I've heard from other players, because I've asked around, like, who they were getting.

57
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,950
And I realized, I told you guys this too when I got invited.

58
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,450
I realized, like, this is gonna be either stacked...

59
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,670
Stacked teams versus, like, I even told you guys, oh yeah, there's like a team that's sort of like Minecrafters.

60
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,570
And then there's gonna be like, teams where it's like, people who can actually aim, and stuff like that.

61
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,290
And then, so, I saw that, and I told you guys, when I told, the very first, one of the very first streams when I told you guys about the invitation.

62
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,850
I was like, I know you guys want me to invite other content creators, but I don't want to get spawncams.

63
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:06,470
I was like, I know it's not enjoyable, and I had, I picked, because I was like, they're not, I thought they weren't gonna change the rules.

64
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,190
Because every time I participated in Twitch Rivals, they've never changed the rules.

65
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,670
And I've always been on the, on the bad end of the stick.

66
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,610
I've always been like, I didn't get absolute shit on.

67
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,570
And I just had to like, uh, uh, I just had to like, roll it off, and was like, oh well, I guess I get free money.

68
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,970
Like, so I thought nothing was gonna be done about it.

69
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,650
Um, and, and I even asked them, I was like, are you guys gonna change the rules?

70
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,490
Is my team gonna have to change?

71
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,010
And stuff like that, multiple times, I've asked them multiple times.

72
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,010
And they're like, nope, nope, it's, it's just rumors, nothing's gonna be happening.

73
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:53,310
Um, so like, this was the very first time I've, uh, had, I realized they are actually gonna change the rules.

74
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,730
And it was like, 24 hours before the tournament.

75
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,210
And every team has like, done scrims, done scrims, done practices.

76
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,510
Um, like, bonded with their teams and everything.

77
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:13,110
And, uh, and like, I thought, I was like, okay.

78
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:29,890
Obviously, I wasn't very happy, um, about it, because I felt like, uh, I even, I, I wouldn't be as unhappy if like, it came out of nowhere, you know?

79
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:39,810
Like, um, like, I even double checked rankings and everything for my entire team, making sure everybody is like, the actual rank and everything.

80
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,830
Within the guidelines, I double checked with Twitch staff multiple times, and I double checked, like, are, are you sure it's okay?

81
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,510
I grabbed 4 1 above alls, including me.

82
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,570
I was like, are you sure?

83
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,130
Are you sure that's okay?

84
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,590
And they're like, yeah, it's alright.

85
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,110
I was like, yeah, you can get 4 1 above alls?

86
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,950
I was like, are you sure?

87
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,230
And like, do you have any pro players?

88
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:06,010
I was like, well, they participated in Marvel Rise tournament, um, and like, uh, RaiMazing was a tier 2 player, not even tier 1.

89
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:12,950
He never, he, um, he didn't get into, like, Overwatch League or was part of any, like, tier 1 orgs or anything.

90
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,810
Uh, RaiMazing wasn't a tier 2.

91
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,330
Um, there are some players that are currently playing, there are tier, that used to be in tier 1 orgs and stuff like that.

92
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,450
And, and so like, so like, I was just like, oh, okay.

93
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,510
That's why I was mad.

94
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,430
That's why I was very mad.

95
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,470
That's why I was very disappointed about all of them.

96
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,090
Um, and, uh, I was, cause I even tried to avoid this from happening.

97
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,150
Cause even my teammates were like, are you sure we're allowed to play?

98
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,870
And I double checked with staff, I quadruple checked with them, and they were like, no, it's fine.

99
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,890
I was like, are you sure?

100
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,810
These, this is their history.

101
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,850
This is what they do.

102
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:48,690
Are you sure?

103
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,330
And they're like, yeah, it's fine.

104
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:58,110
So that's why I brought the team I had, because like, I had access to the teams list that were like, already confirmed.

105
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,870
And I heard about what people were, who they were bringing.

106
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,810
So I was like, I don't, I want at least, like, I don't want to get absolute stomped on.

107
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,090
Because I've had to experience that so many times in Twitch Rivals.

108
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,250
But I laughed it off and like, just was like, whatever.

109
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,310
Okay, that's fine.

110
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,530
Like, yeah, they sort of, I just felt like I got fucked over because, you know, they were gonna say it was casual, but it ended up not being casual.

111
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,310
I was like, whatever.

112
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,270
Like, we did, I did my, I, you know, they needed a fill.

113
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,070
I said yes, because like, I'm fine with filling if they needed an extra person.

114
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:49,310
And, and then they're like, and then so like, knowing that I was like, Marvel Rivals was actually a game that I actually really, really liked.

115
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,550
I really, really liked Marvel Rivals.

116
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,190
You know, I still love Marvel Rivals.

117
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,610
So I was like, at that point, I was like, I'm gonna take this seriously.

118
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,150
I want to be sure, and I want to take this seriously.

119
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,630
I really like Marvel Rivals.

120
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,710
I want to do really well in this Marvel Rivals tournament.

121
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:12,630
Because it was considered one of the, um, one of the first, like, tournaments for Marvel Rivals that I could join as a content creator.

122
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:19,110
Um, because usually in the past, I'm grouped as a professional player, because of my rankings.

123
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:27,930
Like, even as an Apex player, I, my Pred rank was all, was sometimes considered the same as an actual pro player Pred.

124
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,930
And I'm like, no, it's not.

125
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,990
Like, also, I haven't been Pred in a fucking long time.

126
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,870
So like, I always had to deal with situations like this.

127
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:45,050
So I was like, oh my God, yeah, I get to actually be a part of this and like, even participate despite being a high rank.

128
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:57,390
And so like, um, so like, but then, in the end, I was grouped up as a, as, because there's only one, like the highest rank is one above all.

129
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,170
And a pro player for Marvel Rivals can also be one above all.

130
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:10,190
Or like someone that was in the tier one scene in any other game, you know, if they were in a tier one scene in Apex and Overwatch, stuff like that.

131
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,550
They are still, they're in the same category as me.

132
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:22,870
And so Twitch was like, we can put you in a different team with people I don't even know who they are.

133
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,270
I don't know who they are, because they were looking for one more high ranker for their team.

134
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,070
And I was like, I, I'm gonna not, I cannot perform.

135
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,950
Also, I don't know who they are, and I don't feel comfortable with stuff like that.

136
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,590
I need like at least one person I know.

137
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,630
And it was like a full team of randoms that I don't know.

138
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,030
And like, obviously, I joined Twitch Rivals hoping to play with people I know.

139
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,850
And, um, and so like, I was like, no, I don't want to do that.

140
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,650
Like, um, I know my skill level.

141
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,350
I'm gonna be playing support too.

142
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,350
All the high rankers on the other teams are DPS and tank.

143
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,550
They are put in the slot of DPS and tank.

144
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,490
And, um, I would be like one of the few high rankers that would be put on support.

145
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,050
So obviously, they won't, it would be not a great experience.

146
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,490
And I'm worried that I'll be blamed for it.

147
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,890
You know, this person that they're not, like, they don't know who this person is.

148
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,370
They were randomly assigned me as their teammate.

149
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,850
And then, you know, I'd be blamed for it and stuff like that.

150
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,310
Um, it was such a tough situation.

151
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,070
So it was, I cut two of my teammates.

152
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:47,170
So like, for those who want more context, it was like, originally, you can only bring two diamond plus players and then the rest has to be diamond and below.

153
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:56,790
And then they adjusted the rules to make it four diamond plus players and two platinum below.

154
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:12,490
But I joined last minute when the rules where I was like the last three captains that were invited, basically, because when I was invited, all the other captains were already invited for like weeks already.

155
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,290
Um, everyone else were basic had already had a clap captain slot for that held it for weeks.

156
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,770
I had the captain slot when there was only three spots left for captains.

157
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,990
So that's how last minute I was invited in.

158
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:41,530
And I only knew the rules when it was four diamond plus players like you can bring so I didn't even realize they increased the players for it.

159
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,690
I didn't realize that.

160
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,270
That's why the people were like, some teams only had two diamond plus players, but your team has four, and they're one above all.

161
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,150
But like, I didn't know.

162
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,610
I didn't know they changed the rules.

163
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,290
Um, and, uh, because of that, um, I just went with and I saw the team's list.

164
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:12,150
And I already saw that some people were already, uh, that some people were already making it so that, uh, it was already getting stacked.

165
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,790
And I heard like murmurs about how they are stacking it.

166
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,150
And I heard people were getting, uh, I got scared too.

167
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:32,830
Because I heard people were getting multiple Apex players or old Overwatch pros or old Overwatch Apex player, like over Apex pros to be their platinum below players.

168
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,710
So I got scared too.

169
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,990
I was like, oh my God, this is getting very competitive.

170
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,390
It was getting, it was starting to get more and more competitive.

171
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,270
So I was like, well, like, I don't want to get shit on.

172
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,350
I, I'm, I've known from my history of doing Twitch rivals.

173
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,150
I am also my, uh, yeah.

174
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,310
And like my golden plat players.

175
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,710
It's Kony from F who's does fighting games.

176
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,410
And then, uh, Sabubu who has never touched rivals or Overwatch before.

177
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,510
Um, so I was like, yeah.

178
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,810
And there was, it was a 200K prize pool.

179
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:15,710
So I thought it was just going to be like, just like before, like, you know, I thought it was just going to be like all the other Twitch rivals I joined.

180
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,790
Where I was told it was going to be casual, but it's not.

181
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:25,710
I legitimately thought that cause I, I went through all of that shit like so many times.

182
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,430
Remember when I got invited to the Minecraft tournament?

183
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,830
And then like, I got made fun of for not being a Minecrafter and for sub making it far.

184
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,810
I was like, they're like, they're like, it's so dumb that these random people can be in our tournament.

185
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,450
In a Twitch rivals.

186
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,070
I was like, bro, what the fuck?

187
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,630
Um, I'm just like, I was like, bro, what the fuck?

188
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,150
I'm in this call.

189
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:51,610
Like,

190
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,670
oh my God.

191
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,370
I was like, what the fuck?

192
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:11,790
And then when I was in that Fortnite Twitch rivals and like, I got into this, you know, I was told it was going to be a casual Fortnite Twitch rivals.

193
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,850
By the way.

194
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,750
And then they're like, wait, you don't even play for it.

195
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,070
And I was like, oh no, I thought this was just for fun.

196
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,950
And they're just like, I felt so bad for my team.

197
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,470
Cause they're like, oh my God, she's not even, she doesn't even stream on Twitch or play Fortnite.

198
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,030
And they're like, how did you get in here?

199
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,830
And I'm like, I don't know.

200
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,170
I thought this was going to be casual.

201
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,110
I didn't know this was going to be trier.

202
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,860
I thought it was going to be the same.

203
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,840
I legitimately thought this was just going to head towards this direction.

204
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,280
It was most, I was like, oh no, okay.

205
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm going to grab a team.

206
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,220
I'm just going to grab a team that follows that, that still, that follows the guidelines.

207
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,540
But like, I don't want to get spawn camped.

208
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
I don't want...

209
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,020
I was like, um...

210
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,520
So, they changed the rules again.

211
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,140
There's still teams with multiple TN players right now, which I don't understand what they changed, rather than removing you.

212
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Marco, thank you for the super chat.

213
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,980
Thank you, thank you.

214
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,120
So, the last 24 hours before the tournament, they changed the rules again.

215
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,960
Where, uh...

216
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,420
Basically, the last 24 hours.

217
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,320
And this is why I dropped out.

218
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Um, it's that you can have only 2 plus Eternity players.

219
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,460
And my team had 4 one above all players, including me.

220
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,340
So, because of that, a team can be basically 6 GM players if they...

221
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,400
Oh wait, it can be, sorry, it can be 4 GM players.

222
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,100
It can be 4 GM1 players.

223
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,320
Um, if they wanted to.

224
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,820
So, it's just bypass the Eternity thing.

225
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,600
It could be 4 GM players, or maybe like 3 GM players and 1 Celestial.

226
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,100
Um, as long as like, or like Eternity plus 3 GM players and then 1 one above all.

227
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
And it'll still be okay.

228
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,940
Or 2 GM players and 2 one above alls.

229
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,660
That's still fine.

230
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,560
As long as they have 2 players who are below plat.

231
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,760
Plat and below.

232
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,820
So, because of that...

233
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,880
So, for those who don't know what GM is, GM is Grand Master.

234
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,420
So, Grand Master is a rank below Eternity.

235
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,420
Um...

236
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,660
So, you can do that.

237
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,340
So, uh...

238
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,260
So, basically, um, I am one above all.

239
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,500
I am one above all.

240
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,960
Um, and...

241
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,080
We have 3 other players that are one above all.

242
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,660
My team was consisting of streamers that wanted to have an opportunity.

243
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,160
I was the biggest streamer in the team.

244
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,680
So, obviously, I have the bigger fan base.

245
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,700
I have the bigger CCV count and all of that.

246
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,540
And that really matters for Twitch.

247
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,700
Because...

248
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,860
Twitch rivals can only exist if they have people with huge CCV numbers.

249
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,820
Um, and with people watching the streamers that are participating in Twitch Rivals.

250
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,760
So, they want the big streamers.

251
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,320
They want the big streamers participating.

252
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,180
Because more CCV numbers means more sponsors.

253
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,060
It makes the sponsors more happy.

254
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,060
It's a 200k prize pool.

255
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,220
Where do you think that money is coming from?

256
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,200
The sponsors.

257
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,100
So...

258
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,800
CCV is concurrent views.

259
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
So, um...

260
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,380
Because of that...

261
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,090
Of course, they want to make sure that, uh...

262
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
The tournament...

263
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,620
They want everybody to stream the tournament too, by the way.

264
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,060
They want, uh...

265
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,220
Everybody to be able to stream the tournament.

266
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,260
So, they want people to have as much concurrent viewers.

267
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,640
Uh...

268
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,300
Sykkuno is back in the tournament.

269
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,440
Because of the role change.

270
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,900
Because his highest rank was GM.

271
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,820
So, uh...

272
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,100
Nekros team had to boot out two one above all players.

273
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,080
So, like, he had to...

274
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,480
I think it was like KG and ML7.

275
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,480
So, they're support players.

276
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,600
And they got in, like, subs.

277
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,120
The fills.

278
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,200
To help sub in.

279
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,160
So, Sykkuno is back in.

280
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,440
Because his highest rank was GM.

281
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,120
Um...

282
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,100
And...

283
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,840
Uh...

284
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,500
So...

285
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,800
Because of...

286
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,040
Uh...

287
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,780
So, my team...

288
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,400
Um...

289
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,060
Obviously, they wanted to keep me.

290
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,760
Because I was the most...

291
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,380
The highest CCV on the team.

292
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,620
And I bring in a different fan base.

293
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,300
Watching the tournament too.

294
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,120
So, like...

295
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,460
Obviously, they would want me in the tournament.

296
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,540
But...

297
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,860
I was one above all.

298
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,880
And...

299
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,940
I wasn't gonna kick...

300
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,960
A person...

301
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,340
A teammate...

302
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,460
That...

303
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,400
Obviously, needed the exposure more.

304
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
And the money more.

305
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,180
It's literally a 200k prize pool.

306
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,060
$200,000.

307
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,500
And...

308
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,460
Um...

309
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,080
And...

310
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,180
You win regardless.

311
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,280
You can get money.

312
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,500
Despite how you do.

313
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,740
So, even if you lose...

314
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,440
You get money.

315
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,580
Even if you win, you get more money.

316
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,680
But if you lose...

317
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,200
You...

318
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
The least amount of money you'll get from this tournament...

319
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,660
Is $2,000.

320
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,240
The most you can get from this tournament...

321
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,020
Is $5,000.

322
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,740
So, like...

323
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,700
Each player, by the way.

324
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,240
Each player...

325
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:25,840
And...

326
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
I knew...

327
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,500
That this tournament...

328
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,260
Since it's the first tournament...

329
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,900
There's gonna be a lot of eyes on it.

330
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,380
Especially now that there's so much drama.

331
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,780
Like, everybody's gonna be watching it now.

332
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,740
Like...

333
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,340
Even though if you don't wanna support it, just don't watch it.

334
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,840
Like...

335
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,700
It's...

336
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,500
Just like how if you don't wanna support, like...

337
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,540
Something, just don't buy merch.

338
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,620
That's basically it.

339
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:46,860
Like...

340
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,180
Like...

341
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,320
So...

342
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,500
Um...

343
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,360
Anyway...

344
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,320
Um...

345
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,320
Um...

346
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,540
So, like...

347
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,420
Uh...

348
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,680
That's why I'm also streaming it.

349
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,920
Cuz I don't wanna give a view.

350
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,740
I was like, I'm not gonna watch it.

351
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,260
And I told one of the members to just, like, keep me updated.

352
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,200
Like, I was just like, just tell me if you win or not.

353
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,160
I'm not watching it.

354
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,580
I'm sorry.

355
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,440
Okay.

356
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,600
So, um...

357
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,980
I was just like...

358
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,960
I was like, just...

359
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,200
Just...

360
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,260
I'm not hate-watching.

361
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,900
I'm not...

362
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,320
I'm not giving a plus one.

363
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,700
I'm not hate-watching.

364
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,500
Texas, thank you for the super chat.

365
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,040
Thank you.

366
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,880
Thank you.

367
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,900
If you wanna support my team, feel free to watch them.

368
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,800
I'm just not watching because I'm petty like that.

369
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,040
Even if it's plus one view, I'm not watching.

370
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
I refuse...

371
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,160
I refuse to give them my plus one.

372
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,240
Like...

373
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,560
But, like, if you wanna support my team, please feel free to watch them.

374
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,860
I believe it's Super Gomez, Hugs, Kony, Supubu.

375
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,960
I don't know who they got for the two fills because I just, like, tuned it out.

376
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,560
Like, I literally shut it off after I got...

377
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,500
After I dropped out.

378
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,340
Chicory, thank you for the magenta super.

379
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,240
Thank you, thank you.

380
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,840
What a such a cold harsh night.

381
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,240
Even though tomorrow's sun soon rises.

382
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,360
As always, definitely.

383
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,680
Thank you for the magenta super.

384
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,860
Thank you, thank you.

385
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,280
Anyway, so, like...

386
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,920
Basically, I dropped out.

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,080
I chose to drop out.

388
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,740
I know, like, Sanhiko wrote that I got kicked out.

389
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,100
But, no.

390
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,980
I chose to drop out.

391
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,220
Because if I didn't drop out, I would have to kick out...

392
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,860
As captain, I would have to kick two people out.

393
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,900
I would rather kick one person out than two.

394
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,000
Because I don't wanna take away a smaller streamer's opportunity.

395
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,180
To, like...

396
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,840
Yes, technically, you can say I got kicked out.

397
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,300
Because I kicked myself out.

398
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,280
So, you know, you can technically say that.

399
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,520
I kicked myself out.

400
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,900
Like I said, if they make it to the finals, a lot of people will be watching.

401
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,600
Because Marble Rivals is also doing drops right now.

402
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,900
So, if they make it to the finals...

403
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,220
A lot of people will be watching my team's streams.

404
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,300
And I believe...

405
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,440
Especially some of them are content creators within Marble Rivals.

406
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,900
So this is basically...

407
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
It could become their big break.

408
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,160
You know?

409
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,800
That's what I feel like.

410
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,280
This could be their big break into the streaming world.

411
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,040
And they're very good at the games they master.

412
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,020
So, like, they're really good players.

413
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,840
And I don't need the exposure as much.

414
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,120
I don't need the clout.

415
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,160
I don't need the money.

416
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,400
Technically, I'm getting drama clout right now.

417
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,480
But it wasn't intentional.

418
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,100
I swear to God.

419
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,960
It was not intentional.

420
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,480
I needed to let you guys know.

421
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,280
I didn't want you guys to be like...

422
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,960
Doki, where are you?

423
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,500
Why aren't you in the tournament?

424
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,340
So, like...

425
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,900
I had to let you guys know that I'm not gonna be there.

426
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,060
And I had to be clear about, like, why I'm not there.

427
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,300
Yeah.

428
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,640
So...

429
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,000
So, I was like...

430
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,300
I just wanted you guys to know, like, why I wasn't...

431
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,580
As the captain, why I wasn't participating anymore.

432
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,100
I am...

433
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,840
I am gonna say that, like, I am sad that I couldn't participate.

434
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,200
Because, like, you guys all know...

435
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,580
I was really, really, really looking forward to...

436
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,520
No, it was crazy.

437
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,600
After the drama shit, I saw my fucking following count, like, go up by a thousand.

438
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
And I was like, what the fuck?

439
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,800
No wonder people keep farming drama.

440
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,940
It's just that easy.

441
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,040
It wasn't intentional.

442
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
I swear to God, it wasn't.

443
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,480
That's crazy.

444
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,920
I was like, oh my God.

445
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,680
Is this why people do this?

446
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,040
Yeah.

447
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:03,920
Anyway.

448
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,140
Doki moment.

449
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,280
Oh my God.

450
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,160
Catch me on the news next month, guys.

451
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,500
Please, no.

452
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,880
No, I'm joking.

453
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,700
I'm joking.

454
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,240
I hate it.

455
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,060
I was so sad last night.

456
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,540
I was like...

457
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,400
I actually cried an hour straight.

458
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,080
Because I know it was my decision to drop out.

459
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,020
But I still cried.

460
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,210
Because, like, I was incredibly...

461
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,780
I was looking forward to this.

462
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,140
I was really looking forward to playing.

463
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,660
Because I practiced a lot.

464
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,640
I practiced a lot.

465
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,720
And, like, I was...

466
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,500
Honestly, I was, like, really, really looking forward to playing in the tournament setting.

467
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,140
Because it's, like, the first major tournament.

468
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,040
And I thought it was going to be, like, super competitive and stuff like that.

469
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,260
So, of course, I got really sad.

470
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,300
I actually cried an hour after, like, hearing the announcement.

471
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,820
And then after I finished crying, my event coordinator was like...

472
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,600
I know you're feeling really shitty right now.

473
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,300
But you have a tech rehearsal for your convention tomorrow.

474
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,300
And we can't really reschedule it.

475
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,280
And I was like...

476
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,820
Okay.

477
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,140
I'm okay.

478
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,980
I can do this.

479
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,780
I was just, like...

480
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,600
I'm, like...

481
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,800
I can say...

482
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,840
And I'm, like, I'm sad.

483
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,260
They're like...

484
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,480
Oh, can you practice singing real quick?

485
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,280
We really...

486
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,120
So, like, during the tech rehearsal, I had to, like...

487
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:36,700
I had to, like, go do, like, practice, like, see if the soundcheck was okay for karaoke and the panda.

488
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,560
And they're like...

489
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,060
Can we hear you sing?

490
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,000
So we know, like, if the instrumental and your voice would be, like, okay.

491
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,160
And then I was like...

492
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,380
I can't.

493
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,480
I can't.

494
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:47,980
I'm sorry.

495
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,240
But I can be, like...

496
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
I can talk in, like, a louder voice.

497
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,240
It's sort of like singing.

498
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,520
So they're like...

499
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,340
Oh, yeah, that works.

500
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,260
That works, Doki.

501
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,660
So I was like...

502
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,060
Hello.

503
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,820
This is what the volume was singing.

504
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,660
Okay, that's good.

505
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,280
Thank you.

506
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,640
Thanks, Doki.

507
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,460
I was like...

508
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,180
Testing.

509
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,620
While the instrumental...

510
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,100
While, like, be prepared instrumental was playing in the background.

511
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,360
I was like...

512
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,220
Testing.

513
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,300
Testing.

514
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,720
This is the voice I'll be singing with.

515
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,220
And it's like...

516
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,260
Be prepared.

517
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,420
Like, that instrumental was playing in the background while I was doing all that.

518
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,940
Yeah.

519
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,530
And then...

520
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,920
And then...

521
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,240
Yeah.

522
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,160
And...

523
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,920
So I was not okay.

524
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,240
And then today...

525
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,820
I didn't forget.

526
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,620
But, like, obviously I...

527
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,900
Depression slept last night.

528
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,780
And, like, when you're...

529
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,420
When you're sad sleeping...

530
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,740
You...

531
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,680
Obviously, like...

532
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,900
When you wake up...

533
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,620
It's...

534
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,160
You...

535
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,100
You obviously are not there.

536
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,180
So...

537
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,660
So...

538
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,540
I actually almost was late.

539
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,060
Because...

540
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,900
I didn't set any alarm.

541
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,600
And then, like...

542
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,240
My manager...

543
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,440
My...

544
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,440
My manager called me to wake me up.

545
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,360
But, like...

546
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,500
I didn't pick up.

547
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,440
I was just like...

548
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,300
What the fuck is my manager calling me at 7 in the morning?

549
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,220
What kind of freak is he?

550
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,000
I was like...

551
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,500
Goddamn freak calling me at 7.50?

552
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,940
What's wrong with you?

553
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,240
Of course I'm not gonna, like...

554
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
What?

555
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,100
So I didn't pick up.

556
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:44,840
I...

557
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,240
I didn't...

558
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
I didn't pick up the phone.

559
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,680
Because of it.

560
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,460
So...

561
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,300
And then I was looking at my Discord messages.

562
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,420
And then right after I didn't pick up...

563
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,120
My manager was like...

564
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,340
You have a meet and greet in 7 minutes.

565
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,860
And I was like...

566
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,240
Like...

567
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,980
The message?

568
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,780
And I was like...

569
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,440
Oh shit!

570
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,500
Oh my god.

571
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,500
I was like...

572
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,900
Oh shit!

573
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,400
And then I looked at my Discord...

574
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,320
Again.

575
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,760
And...

576
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,620
And I was like...

577
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,180
And then I was like...

578
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,720
Oh my god!

579
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,820
20 new messages!

580
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,440
Oh my...

581
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,340
I was like...

582
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,240
Oh my god!

583
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,520
Oh my god!

584
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,080
They're like...

585
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,220
And then it was just...

586
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,420
It was just like...

587
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,800
Like my event coordinator being like...

588
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,520
Where are you?

589
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,960
They're like...

590
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,360
Hello?

591
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,640
And then they were like...

592
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,400
This is the last message my event coordinator sent me.

593
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,800
They were like...

594
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Hello?

595
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,800
It's before the messages.

596
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,540
It was just like...

597
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,120
Hey, are you ready in 30 minutes?

598
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,100
They need to do...

599
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,800
They also...

600
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,460
By the way, they're gonna need to do like...

601
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:00,840
Check...

602
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,460
Sound check and stuff like that.

603
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,000
And then, you know...

604
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,880
Last 10 minutes, they just wrote...

605
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,180
Hello?

606
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,640
Yeah.

607
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,380
You know, there was just...

608
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,880
I was like...

609
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm so sorry.

610
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,940
They're like...

611
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,540
No, we understand what happened last night.

612
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,000
We...

613
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,580
We...

614
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,920
We understand.

615
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,620
I'm like...

616
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,760
I'm so sorry.

617
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,380
I'm here now.

618
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,000
Like...

619
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,100
A lot of stuff happened.

620
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,160
I'm sorry.

621
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,960
But I'm here now.

622
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh my god.

623
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,180
It was just really poor timing overall.

624
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,760
Thank you for the super chat.

625
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,100
Thank you.

626
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,640
Thank you.

627
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,040
You're great.

628
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,620
Go back.

629
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,320
Go back to Final Fantasy VII.

630
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,980
Yeah, you look like a chocobo in the engineering way.

631
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,200
Thank you for the super chat.

632
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,560
Thank you.

633
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,180
Thank you.

634
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,700
Shady, thank you for the super chat.

635
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,000
Thank you.

636
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,480
Thank you.

637
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,520
The only person who kicked me out is me.

638
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you for the magenta soup.

639
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,440
Thank you.

640
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,840
Thank you.

641
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,220
Anyway, I'm also not the only person that kicked themselves out as captain.

642
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,060
J3 also kicked himself out as well.

643
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,780
Because he also wanted...

644
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,620
Similar to me.

645
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,220
I think he saw like what I said about like...

646
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,780
Oh, I think like...

647
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,760
And then, he's like...

648
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,260
I think he also kicked himself out.

649
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,780
So that his teammates could also get exposure and stuff.

650
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,960
So, he was the captain.

651
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,380
So, J3 was also a captain for his team.

652
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,140
And I believe he was also like the biggest streamer for his team as well.

653
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,880
And he too also decided to like...

654
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,100
Kick himself out.

655
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,760
So that he didn't have to kick out like his other...

656
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Other one about like Eternity Plus players.

657
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,440
So, yeah.

658
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,240
I wasn't the only one that did it.

659
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,420
J3 did as well.

660
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,740
Which was also...

661
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,980
I felt like was really nice of him to do as well.

662
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,400
But yeah, like...

663
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,180
So, that was basically the whole mess of everything.

664
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,260
Like I said, I...

665
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,320
I dropped out for my team.

666
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,700
Because I just didn't want to kick out two of my teammates.

667
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Because they were very excited.

668
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,520
Like in the group chats, they were very excited.

669
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,200
They were like, let's try and win this.

670
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,520
Let's try and get to the finals.

671
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,680
Let's get to Day 2.

672
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,540
Like, let's make it to the quarterfinals.

673
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,280
Or like the finals, quarterfinals.

674
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,160
And they all trained really, really hard.

675
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,280
They were actually doing like VOD reviews.

676
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,200
And like scouting and stuff.

677
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,220
Like seeing what strategies people were using.

678
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,120
Trying to see what strategies to use and stuff like that.

679
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,880
And I just didn't want to take that away from them.

680
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,280
And...

681
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,740
And I thought that like, you know...

682
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,720
I was already very lucky with my career.

683
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,200
Like, I'm very lucky with my career.

684
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,580
And...

685
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:47,080
I am very fortunate to have you guys as my fans.

686
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,920
To have my Dragoons with me.

687
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,380
To support me through everything.

688
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,580
I can do variety.

689
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,060
I'm very lucky to be able to do variety.

690
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,200
I'm also very lucky to force you guys to let me take you guys hostage.

691
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,080
And force you guys to watch 16 hours of Marvel Rivals.

692
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
For three days straight.

693
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,420
I'm very lucky.

694
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,400
I can make you do anything.

695
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,020
In terms of watching any types of my streams.

696
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,900
A lot of people don't have that type of...

697
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,840
Don't have that type of community.

698
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,540
Or like...

699
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,620
Doki, please.

700
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,060
A lot...

701
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,280
A lot of people don't have that opportunity.

702
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,720
And...

703
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,920
Like I said, this Twitch Rivals...

704
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,700
For them, is basically their big break.

705
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,060
It's also maybe like their very first Twitch Rivals ever.

706
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,920
This might be my...

707
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,180
I mean, I didn't even participate in it.

708
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,740
What was my...

709
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,080
I can't believe Minecraft could have been my very fucking last Twitch Rivals.

710
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,240
That fucking is so...

711
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,400
I can't believe it.

712
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,340
I don't know.

713
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
I don't know if that bridge is burnt down.

714
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
I was very disappointed.

715
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,840
I got...

716
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,040
The head Twitch Rivals organizer...

717
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,280
Got in a call with me to try and apologize.

718
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,340
Being like...

719
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,220
You don't understand.

720
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,600
Like, checking everybody's rankings and stuff like that.

721
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,120
It's...

722
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,160
You know, it's a lot of work.

723
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,160
It's very hard to do.

724
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,060
And stuff.

725
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,800
And...

726
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,060
And they tried to apologize.

727
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,260
They tried to say like...

728
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,580
We would love to have you in the next Marvel Rivals tournament.

729
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,080
But like...

730
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,640
Or like in the next Marvel Rivals.

731
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,700
But like...

732
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,240
I don't know.

733
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,260
I don't know.

734
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
I don't know if the bridge is burnt down.

735
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,980
I think like...

736
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,820
I cut the rope.

737
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,420
But I don't know if they can...

738
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,060
Like, piece the rope back together.

739
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,600
I cut the rope on my end.

740
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,820
But like...

741
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,340
I don't know if it's fixable.

742
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,200
Cause like...

743
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,260
I was very mad.

744
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,880
I...

745
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,500
I was very mad.

746
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,520
Cause...

747
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,240
I would understand...

748
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,300
If like...

749
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,300
I didn't do anything...

750
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:58,900
To make...

751
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,640
To avoid it.

752
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,320
If I just gave them the team.

753
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,820
And just never checked again.

754
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,780
You know?

755
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,680
But...

756
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
I was concerned too.

757
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,260
I was concerned.

758
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,500
Is my team too high-elo?

759
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:10,900
And...

760
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,140
I tried everything I could...

761
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,000
To make sure...

762
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,480
If like...

763
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,040
It was okay.

764
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,780
And...

765
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Um...

766
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,260
And...

767
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,300
I...

768
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,720
Um...

769
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,860
And like...

770
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,980
I did everything I can...

771
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,360
To like...

772
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:26,640
Uh...

773
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,420
To like make sure that...

774
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,180
Uh...

775
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,220
You know...

776
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,660
Uh...

777
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,900
Things wouldn't go that way.

778
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,380
But it ended up going that way.

779
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,320
And...

780
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,520
It sucked that it was...

781
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
24 hours.

782
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,620
I would've been okay if they even gave me 2 days notice.

783
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,320
You know?

784
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:43,920
I...

785
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,020
I would've been fine.

786
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
If it was 2 days.

787
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,060
But it was 24 hours.

788
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,440
I...

789
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,840
The day before...

790
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,080
That...

791
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,400
24 hour notice...

792
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,420
I...

793
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,340
Did a...

794
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,560
2 hour scrim...

795
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,300
And a 2 hour VOD review.

796
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,760
I can't take that back.

797
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,140
I'm a very busy woman.

798
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,560
Like...

799
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,280
I'm very busy.

800
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,440
I can't take those hours back.

801
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,660
If I do...

802
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,140
That's it.

803
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:18,980
Yeah.

804
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,220
Yeah.

805
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,540
Um...

806
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,500
Yeah, so...

807
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,700
It's just like...

808
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,500
If I knew...

809
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,540
I would not have done that.

810
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,460
And...

811
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,420
I remember...

812
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,680
That day I was so busy.

813
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,750
Cause I had...

814
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,900
What did I have?

815
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,820
I remember I was so busy that day too.

816
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,240
And I still went to the scrim.

817
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,340
And like...

818
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,300
Did a VOD review.

819
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,280
Despite like...

820
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,120
My schedule was so fucked up.

821
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,280
Like...

822
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,760
Alright.

823
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,560
Oh yeah.

824
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,860
That was after God of War.

825
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,420
I was so tired.

826
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,880
Literally...

827
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,720
I...

828
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,760
That was...

829
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,440
Right after God of War too.

830
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,600
Like...

831
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,820
So...

832
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,640
Right after God of War.

833
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,620
I had 30 minute break.

834
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,780
And then I went to scrims.

835
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,780
And then I did a VOD review.

836
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,940
And then thinking...

837
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,600
That everything is okay.

838
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,760
Yeah.

839
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,280
I thought...

840
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,980
You know...

841
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,180
Right after God of War.

842
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,300
I could rest.

843
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,060
But...

844
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,800
Especially after finding out...

845
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,920
That Artanis was Loki.

846
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,620
And I raised a fucking disappointment.

847
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,940
I couldn't.

848
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,400
I couldn't process that.

849
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,400
I had to go straight to Rivals.

850
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,680
I couldn't process that my son was Loki.

851
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,720
So...

852
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,200
So...

853
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,100
That's why...

854
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,760
It gave me two days notice.

855
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,420
I would've been okay.

856
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,260
I would've been fine.

857
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,920
I would've been mad as mad.

858
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,820
I would've still kicked myself out.

859
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,260
But like...

860
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,080
I wouldn't be as mad.

861
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,940
I wouldn't.

862
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,860
Dan, welcome to the tomato farm.

863
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,720
Welcome, welcome.

864
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,560
But yeah.

865
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,520
That's why I was like...

866
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,680
Extra disappointed.

867
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,900
And extra like...

868
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,860
Mad about the whole situation.

869
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,680
And then like...

870
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,100
Yeah, so...

871
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,240
Yeah, it was just...

872
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,120
It was just all over the place.

873
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,120
The organization.

874
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,680
But like I said...

875
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,620
Like...

876
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,680
I really, really wanted to...

877
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,420
I really, really wanted to give...

878
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,000
The smaller streamers a chance to participate.

879
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,920
Because I don't know if you know this.

880
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,360
But...

881
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,620
Twitch Rivals...

882
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,840
Tend to be like the same people.

883
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,760
Including me.

884
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,620
Like, obviously I take advantage of that.

885
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,820
Because it's like...

886
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,580
Free money.

887
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,620
And also like...

888
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,340
Also the fact that like...

889
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,700
I can also bring...

890
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,200
Sometimes they give me a chance to bring my own team.

891
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,740
And...

892
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,640
Because of that, sometimes I...

893
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,340
You know, I include someone that I know.

894
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,400
Someone I know, someone I'm comfortable with.

895
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,940
But I also try to include people who are smaller streamers.

896
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:15,880
Because...

897
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,240
A lot of small streamers...

898
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,880
The only chance to get into Twitch Rivals for the small streamers...

899
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,200
Is basically...

900
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,440
Being invited by a captain.

901
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,280
And that's really rare.

902
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,060
It's really rare for that to happen.

903
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,880
Because obviously...

904
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,380
We all want to invite our friends.

905
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,780
We all want to invite our friends, but sometimes like...

906
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,340
You know, we want to invite friends who are really good at the game or something.

907
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,240
And stuff like that.

908
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,900
Or we want to invite people we want to network with.

909
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,780
Like, sometimes I have to think about that too.

910
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,320
Like, oh, do I want to invite this person?

911
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,440
Like, as a chance to network with them.

912
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,280
Stuff like that.

913
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,460
So, it's all about that.

914
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,340
But it tends to be around, you know...

915
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,520
So, being in Twitch Rivals...

916
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,800
For a small streamer...

917
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,680
Is an incredible opportunity.

918
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,700
Like, it's basically a goal or a dream for some of them.

919
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:02,760
So...

920
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,500
And like I said, the reason why...

921
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,320
They actually want you to invite...

922
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,780
Your friends or people with bigger streamers.

923
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:12,940
Because...

924
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,400
The bigger numbers you have for Twitch Rivals...

925
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,940
The happier the sponsors are.

926
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:17,980
So like...

927
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,000
So like, that's basically the whole deal.

928
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,080
Like, that's how most...

929
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,960
That's why for my tournament...

930
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,120
Sometimes I do invite bigger content creators.

931
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,280
Because I want to make, you know, the sponsors happy.

932
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,460
I want to make sure, like, you know...

933
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,340
But I try to balance out with smaller content creators too.

934
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,740
Like, it's a mix between big content creators and smaller content creators.

935
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,140
Because, you know...

936
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,740
I want to let people know, like...

937
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,600
Hey, here are the numbers I can get when I host an event.

938
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,520
And host a tournament.

939
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,220
To encourage sponsorships.

940
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,260
To encourage people to sponsor this again.

941
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,620
Or like, encourage new sponsors to fund my events.

942
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,380
Stuff like that.

943
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,360
But I still want to mix between small content creators and big content creators.

944
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,320
But if I'm self-funding it...

945
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,580
If I'm self-funding it...

946
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,620
I don't care about what numbers.

947
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:09,900
Obviously.

948
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,480
Like, WrestleTuber.

949
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I invited big content creators.

950
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,300
I invited smaller content creators.

951
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,620
Because, like...

952
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,380
I'm self...

953
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,340
Like, a lot of it was self-sponsored.

954
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,440
And then, like, other...

955
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,280
Like, Gamersubs helped in as well.

956
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,440
Gamersubs helped in.

957
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,100
But when I first started the idea, it was all, like, my idea.

958
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,100
And then Gamersubs came in to help fund majority of my ideas.

959
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:31,930
And then...

960
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,000
They were okay with the numbers.

961
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,300
Because it was just on my channel.

962
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,640
So everything just funnels into my channel.

963
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,500
The numbers-wise.

964
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,960
So it appeased the sponsors.

965
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,380
That's basically how tournaments work.

966
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,000
It's all about making sure they can have...

967
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,200
They get enough numbers.

968
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
So it makes sponsors happy.

969
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,940
And then they can continue to host these events.

970
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,620
So they can continue to, like, host these events.

971
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,000
And continue to have funding for these events.

972
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,040
And stuff like that.

973
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,240
That's basically how tournaments and events work.

974
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,280
Unless they're self-funded.

975
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,500
If you're self-funded, you don't care.

976
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,260
You are your own sponsor.

977
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,480
Like...

978
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:17,340
I am my own sponsor.

979
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,440
Who fucking cares?

980
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,700
As long as the fans enjoy it.

981
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,460
That's all I care about.

982
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,740
But...

983
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,380
But yeah.

984
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,820
So this is, like, basically the insight of everything that happened.

985
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,680
Like, it was just a shitshow overall.

986
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,340
Like, of course, if you have a 200k prize pool.

987
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
You cannot make a 4 fun tournament.

988
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:46,820
Like...

989
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,160
There's no way.

990
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,560
It's 200k!

991
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,460
I don't need that money.

992
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,800
But, like, to other people, that's a lot of money.

993
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,800
It's like that Minecraft Twitch Rivals.

994
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
With what?

995
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,080
500k?

996
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,040
To what?

997
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,540
What was it?

998
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,600
500k?

999
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,660
And one person wins 100k?

1000
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,660
No, what was it?

1001
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,140
Oh my god.

1002
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,460
Wait, no.

1003
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:11,760
Was it?

1004
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,080
I don't remember.

1005
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,900
Was it 100k?

1006
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,700
It was like, one person wins 100k.

1007
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:17,920
Like...

1008
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,820
Whoa!

1009
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,700
And it was...

1010
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,720
And the finals was Connect 4.

1011
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,400
Oh my god.

1012
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,100
That shit was wild.

1013
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,180
They made the finals Connect 4.

1014
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,280
And then, the two players that made it to the...

1015
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,180
For those who didn't watch the Twitch Rivals Minecraft series...

1016
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,900
Nobody wins...

1017
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,860
Other than the people who make it to the finals.

1018
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,140
So, only...

1019
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:44,880
Out of, like...

1020
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,760
How many players?

1021
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,580
Out of, like, 100...

1022
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,260
200 players?

1023
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,220
Was it 200 players?

1024
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,140
I think it was more than 200 players.

1025
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,300
It was a lot of people.

1026
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,320
It was not 100.

1027
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,480
I remember.

1028
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,100
It was not 100 people.

1029
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,260
And...

1030
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,780
And they invited people from all over.

1031
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,940
So, it wasn't just Minecrafters.

1032
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,320
So, I got invited.

1033
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,080
But there was also other people that I invited that were just not...

1034
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,720
Normal people.

1035
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,160
Like, not normal players.

1036
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,760
And...

1037
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,500
And, like...

1038
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,480
But then, like...

1039
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,320
You can only get the money if you make it to top 16 or something.

1040
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,780
But then, like...

1041
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,200
The person who wins the tournament...

1042
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,900
Gets, like...

1043
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,340
100k.

1044
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,640
Only top 30 got money.

1045
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,140
Only top 30 got money.

1046
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,740
And the final...

1047
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,420
Was it 50 or 100k, guys?

1048
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:31,940
I don't remember.

1049
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,500
Like, the number blurs together.

1050
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,040
But it was a lot of money.

1051
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,860
Only one winner can get, like, the big prize pool.

1052
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,980
And it was either 50k or 100k.

1053
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,580
And then...

1054
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,740
During the finals...

1055
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,180
The finals finals was Connect 4.

1056
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,300
And...

1057
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,740
And because it was Connect 4...

1058
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,740
The two remaining players...

1059
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,740
Forced a stalemate...

1060
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,360
Out of rebellion for this tournament.

1061
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,900
Oh, yeah.

1062
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,300
Okay.

1063
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,600
It was 100k to first place.

1064
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,760
And second place gets 10k.

1065
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,700
Is that shit fucking crazy?

1066
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,320
That is not for fun at that point.

1067
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,460
That is not.

1068
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,240
Yeah, so, like...

1069
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,720
They were, like...

1070
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:25,020
They were so frustrated with how the entire tournament was run...

1071
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,880
That the last two players...

1072
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
Forced a 30...

1073
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,060
What was it?

1074
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,280
It was, like...

1075
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,260
One to two hours overtime.

1076
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,140
They made the fucking entire event...

1077
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,500
One to two hours longer.

1078
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,040
And, like...

1079
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,420
Just doing draws.

1080
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,500
Because it was Connect 4.

1081
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,900
So they could just do draws.

1082
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,920
Like, they just kept fucking tying.

1083
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,640
Over and over...

1084
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,980
And over again.

1085
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,340
And it was... Okay.

1086
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,780
But it was, like, pure cinema.

1087
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,580
Because it was, like...

1088
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,420
The English community versus the Spanish community.

1089
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,760
So it was pure cinema.

1090
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,080
Because they united together.

1091
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,040
To work together.

1092
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,780
For the evil...

1093
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,640
It was, like...

1094
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,060
The English community, Minecraft community, and the Spanish Minecraft community...

1095
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,820
Working together to take down...

1096
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,780
To take down...

1097
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,960
The higher-ups.

1098
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,740
To fight against the man.

1099
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,560
To fight against Big Corpo.

1100
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:35,880
So...

1101
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,060
So...

1102
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,440
It was actually pure cinema.

1103
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,080
You guys missed out on that era.

1104
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,880
But, yeah.

1105
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:48,800
Like I said.

1106
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,920
I don't know how I feel...

1107
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,100
Currently, regarding Twitch.

1108
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,560
I know, like, my manager really wanted me to stream...

1109
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,760
Like, at least once or twice...

1110
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,540
Twice...

1111
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,500
Once or, like...

1112
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,840
Twice a...

1113
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,000
Once a week.

1114
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,680
Or every other week.

1115
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,560
But I don't know.

1116
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,840
Other than that, it soured my entire mood over Twitch at the moment.

1117
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,740
So, like...

1118
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:09,620
I might stay on YouTube.

1119
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,300
I might just be on YouTube.

1120
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,700
Just, you know...

1121
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,660
Just chill on YouTube.

1122
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,160
And stuff for a bit.

1123
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,060
Just to cool down.

1124
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,520
I got so mad that I actually, like...

1125
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:20,620
Unfollowed...

1126
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,920
Unfollowed, like, one or two people.

1127
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,220
Because they were, like...

1128
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,160
They were, like...

1129
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,560
Dick-sucking...

1130
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,800
Twitch rivals.

1131
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,160
And I was just like...

1132
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,740
Fuck that.

1133
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,960
Macken won't see this on my feed.

1134
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,700
Like...

1135
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,980
I was like...

1136
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,920
I was like...

1137
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,640
I literally...

1138
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,300
That was how mad I was yesterday.

1139
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:44,720
I was so...

1140
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,900
I was just like...

1141
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,580
I was like...

1142
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,560
Give criticism...

1143
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:47,900
Like...

1144
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,720
Don't, like, just...

1145
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,520
Don't just...

1146
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,600
Because, like...

1147
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:51,880
Okay.

1148
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,280
This is how my mindset goes.

1149
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,320
Like...

1150
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,640
They deserve criticism.

1151
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,500
On that part.

1152
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,240
Like...

1153
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,420
I was legitimately...

1154
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,600
Was like...

1155
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,020
Like, you can fucking...

1156
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:01,760
Like, I don't know.

1157
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,760
You can, like...

1158
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:03,620
Like...

1159
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,560
Like, suck your dick.

1160
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,700
Because, like...

1161
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,340
Your life...

1162
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,060
You know, your...

1163
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,840
Your entire career is on Twitch.

1164
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,160
You know?

1165
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
You can't burn that bridge.

1166
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,480
I'm lucky for the fact that, like...

1167
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,360
I can be on YouTube.

1168
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,900
Like, I'm primarily on YouTube.

1169
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,860
So, like...

1170
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,160
Like, if that bridge is burnt down...

1171
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,340
At least I still have YouTube.

1172
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,180
Um...

1173
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,900
So, like...

1174
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,380
It makes sense for them to, like...

1175
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,300
To be, like...

1176
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:24,980
You know...

1177
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,320
To, like...

1178
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:26,940
You know...

1179
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,700
Cover for them.

1180
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,920
But I'm, like...

1181
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,420
But...

1182
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,700
Yesterday, in my head...

1183
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,760
I was, like...

1184
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,060
I was, like...

1185
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,660
Look...

1186
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,560
They actually deserve criticism on that part.

1187
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,380
That was, like...

1188
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,040
Really fucked up.

1189
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:37,660
Like...

1190
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:37,840
And...

1191
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,600
Like...

1192
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,580
I was, like...

1193
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,740
I was really...

1194
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,680
Really messed up.

1195
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,620
Like...

1196
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,680
They deserve criticism.

1197
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,340
You can't defend every...

1198
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:49,880
There's...

1199
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,480
You can defend...

1200
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,380
But you have to give criticism when it's valid.

1201
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:53,940
And that...

1202
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,960
I felt like that was the moment...

1203
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,500
When it was incredibly valid.

1204
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,320
Like...

1205
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,360
Um...

1206
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,540
So, like...

1207
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,540
Uh...

1208
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,380
Uh...

1209
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:02,920
So, like...

1210
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,140
Yeah.

1211
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,120
I was just, like...

1212
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,860
I know some people were, like...

1213
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,320
Oh, yeah.

1214
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:05,820
Valkyrie.

1215
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,100
No.

1216
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,180
It was not Valkyrie's fault.

1217
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,320
It was not Valkyrie's fault.

1218
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,300
Um...

1219
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,220
She gave criticism.

1220
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,700
And it was...

1221
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,880
It was, like...

1222
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,500
Good criticism.

1223
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,720
Um...

1224
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,360
And then...

1225
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,700
She was also not happy that they changed their roles...

1226
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,940
Within the last 24 hours.

1227
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,100
It was...

1228
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,360
Like...

1229
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,540
This was her first Twitch Rivals.

1230
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,380
Like...

1231
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,400
Apparently, this was...

1232
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,720
Her very first Twitch Rivals.

1233
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,440
And nobody...

1234
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,020
Like...

1235
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,540
Nobody on staff told her...

1236
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,260
That, like...

1237
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,940
They were planning on changing their roles.

1238
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,360
And stuff.

1239
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:32,880
Too.

1240
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:33,960
Like...

1241
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,180
They kept changing their roles.

1242
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,280
If they didn't...

1243
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,700
If they kept the original...

1244
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,400
Two GM players...

1245
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,660
Like...

1246
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,400
Two...

1247
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,960
Uh...

1248
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,920
Diamond Plus players...

1249
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,980
It would have been fine.

1250
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,380
But they changed it...

1251
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,420
And they flipped back.

1252
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,420
So, like...

1253
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,020
Like...

1254
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,880
That was the...

1255
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,220
That was the biggest issue.

1256
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,260
And...

1257
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,380
Ray was also mad.

1258
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,160
That...

1259
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,120
Ray was also mad.

1260
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,860
That, like...

1261
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,980
They changed their roles within the last 24 hours.

1262
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,100
Because they kept flip-flopping.

1263
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,220
Too.

1264
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:03,980
Um...

1265
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,920
So, like...

1266
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,840
It's not like...

1267
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,080
It's not like...

1268
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,860
Uh...

1269
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,380
Like...

1270
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,200
People were complaining.

1271
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,920
But they were all valid criticism.

1272
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,100
Uh...

1273
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,140
And, like...

1274
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,380
So, that's why I was very mad.

1275
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,700
Like...

1276
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,220
I was like...

1277
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:16,980
You can, like...

1278
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,660
Fucking...

1279
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,440
I don't know...

1280
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,700
Dick ratting...

1281
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:19,960
Like...

1282
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,940
All you want.

1283
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,680
But, like...

1284
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,120
I don't want to see that on my feed.

1285
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,360
When I'm mad.

1286
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:23,900
When I'm mad...

1287
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,760
Like...

1288
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,340
I was like...

1289
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,780
I don't want to see that.

1290
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,600
Like...

1291
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,880
Like, I don't care.

1292
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:36,820
You...

1293
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,300
Clearly.

1294
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,620
I know that you rely on Twitch for your career and you want to be on their good side.

1295
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,480
But, if you keep...

1296
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,780
If you don't criticize them, they will never improve.

1297
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,060
Because they think they can just brush this underneath their rug and it'll be fine.

1298
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:58,280
Like, why- they will never change if you just let them keep doing what- if you just, like, you know...

1299
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,840
Um, let them do whatever and just roll- I wasn't gonna get rolled over, that is why.

1300
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,520
I was not rolling over, like...

1301
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,600
I'm done with rolling over, like...

1302
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,480
I- I was... yeah.

1303
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,560
I was- I was so- I was not- I was not fucking standing up for myself, like...

1304
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,980
Like, I let them fucking walk over me from the other Twitch arrivals, cause I just laughed it off.

1305
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,800
And now, like, this was a game I was really passionate about.

1306
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,320
And I- like, I actually was like, I really wanna do well.

1307
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,180
Like, I really wanna do well.

1308
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,760
I really enjoy- I really enjoy Marvel Rivals.

1309
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,440
And I was so passionate about it.

1310
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,900
I worked really hard practicing for it- for it.

1311
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,040
I was like, I wasn't gonna roll- roll over this time.

1312
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,460
Um, yeah.

1313
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,240
So, like, that's basically- oh my god, sorry.

1314
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,340
This has actually been, like, a one hour venting session.

1315
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,340
I'm sorry, guys.

1316
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,160
I- this is literally rent-free in my head.

1317
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,240
Like, I'm sorry.

1318
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:07,140
It's like, I'm- it's actually- Twitch is living rent-free in my head.

1319
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,940
No, it's doing what they wanted!

1320
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,500
It did- No!

1321
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,240
I basically let them get in my head.

1322
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,680
That's what they wanted.

1323
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:18,380
No.

1324
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,540
That's what they wanted.

1325
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,120
No, you're giving them attention!

1326
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,720
You're supposed to ignore it!

1327
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,460
Um...

1328
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,080
Yeah, so, yeah, that's- sorry.

1329
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,880
You guys are, like, my therapists right now, guys.

1330
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,460
I'm sorry.

1331
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,320
I'm sorry.

1332
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,820
You guys- you guys are, like, my therapists.

1333
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,540
I need to get through the day.

1334
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,500
I-

1335
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,580
I'm sorry.

1336
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1337
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,160
It's just like, yeah.

1338
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,800
So, yeah, that's- that's really it.

1339
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,860
Like I said, like, I'm not on the main platform.

1340
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,420
Like, Twitch isn't my main platform.

1341
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,980
And I'm not the biggest streamer.

1342
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,060
Like, I'm sort of like a nobody on Twitch.

1343
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:22,640
So, like, my opinion doesn't really matter when it comes to, like, Twitch stuff.

1344
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:30,180
So, uh, yeah, so like, it's understandable that, like, like, you know, fuck me, you know?

1345
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,020
Um, but, uh, but I'm all right.

1346
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,260
I feel a lot better, though.

1347
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,440
I feel... I do feel a lot better.

1348
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,500
Uh, stream, thank you for the magenta supa.

1349
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,220
Thank you, thank you.

1350
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,180
Doki professionals have standards.

1351
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,300
Uh, Mr. Sen, thank you for the aka-supa.

1352
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,380
Thank you, thank you.

1353
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,360
Thank you for your service.

1354
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,360
We're so proud of you.

1355
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,320
Thank you, doki-supa.

1356
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,180
Thank you, thank you.

1357
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,600
Mori, thank you for the super chat.

1358
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,340
Thank you, thank you.

1359
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,600
As a therapist, as your therapist, I can remind you to take your meds.

1360
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,140
Chat isn't real, except for Mori, apparently.

1361
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,340
She was the only one I was talking to.

1362
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,100
Uh, Liet, thank you for the super chat.

1363
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,780
Thank you, thank you.

1364
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,060
Instead of paying for therapists, we pay you here.

1365
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,260
We pay you here.

1366
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,320
It's a small installment.

1367
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,400
Thank you.

1368
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,500
See, it's even better than therapy.

1369
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,740
I get paid.

1370
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:23,040
I get paid instead of paying thousands of dollars for one hour session.

1371
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,260
Thank you for the super chat.

1372
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,360
Thank you, thank you.

1373
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,900
Uh, Billy Bada, Billy Bada, dum-ba-da-dum, Billy Bada.

1374
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,700
Sorry, my local chan canteen is open, stuck in my head.

1375
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,880
Hope you're well, doki.

1376
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,200
Thank you for the super chat, Brian.

1377
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,340
Thank you, thank you.

1378
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,660
I really appreciate it.

1379
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,720
Thank you so much.

1380
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,200
Um, but yeah, I hope my team does well.

1381
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,740
I hope they make it to the finals.

1382
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,100
I hope they make it to the finals, even without me and Rai.

1383
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,120
I believe Rai also dropped out.

1384
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,160
Um, for his team.

1385
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:59,460
Um, so I hope they do good and they make it to the finals, because honestly, um, they deserve it.

1386
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,100
They deserve the exposure.

1387
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,940
They deserve the clout and they deserve the money that comes with it.

1388
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,280
So yeah, good luck to them.

1389
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,800
Um, yeah, they're like, oh, oh my god.

1390
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,660
Okay, this is one...

1391
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,320
Oh my god, I...

1392
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:26,040
Okay, like, I know, like, some of the people were offered, like, chances to co- they're like, you can co-stream it too, so you can get, like, a viewer, like, a viewer boost from the rivals.

1393
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,680
I don't know why that would make me more incentivized to be okay with it.

1394
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,500
Like, you can get a viewer boost from the Twitch rivals.

1395
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,360
I put a play in it.

1396
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:44,940
I don't fucking...

1397
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,940
I was like, I don't care about the viewership numbers.

1398
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,240
Like, I mean, I do care because I want to have a career.

1399
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:05,180
Like, I still want to, I still need to pay bills, but like, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't care.

1400
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:05,740
I don't know.

1401
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,080
I don't like, I don't like watching it.

1402
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,420
Like, like, I guess I don't like doing watch-alongs of this shit.

1403
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,140
Like, I feel like it made me sadder, honestly.

1404
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,660
I- no, it would, it would, because I'd be like, I could be playing right now.

1405
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,260
I would have definitely been more sad.

1406
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:32,500
I'd be like, you could have been playing it, but here you are watching them win without you.

1407
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,460
Like, that'd be, oh my god, that fucking FOMO's gonna hit me hard there.

1408
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,920
Yeah, I didn't want to get hit by the FOMO there.

1409
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,620
So I was like, no, I'm not, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stream my own thing.

1410
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:53,320
I'm gonna go to YouTube, like, fucking, like, I'm gonna go back to YouTube and stream something there.

1411
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:02,900
Like, um, um, thank you for the super chat.

1412
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,060
Thank you, thank you.

1413
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,900
Yeah, I feel like I was gonna get on a chair right there.

1414
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:18,340
Like, I feel like I have to sit in a chair, like, look at these people having fun without you.

1415
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:19,500
Wow.

1416
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,240
Oh, I was like, fuck that shit.

1417
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,220
I just talked to my chat.

1418
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,780
Like, uh, Mr. Kermit, thank you for the super chat.

1419
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,200
Thank you, thank you.

1420
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,180
Um, first time here and I just witnessed a therapy session.

1421
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,580
Now I'm gonna, now I know this is, I'm sorry for the trauma dump, guys.

1422
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,980
Trauma dump, trigger warning, twitch.

1423
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,240
Now I know this is gonna be my next favorite streamer.

1424
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,540
Thank you for the super chat.

1425
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,420
Thank you, thank you.

1426
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,540
Uh, Solace, thank you for your very first super chat.

1427
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,440
Thank you, thank you.

1428
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,820
Thanks to you, I became also addicted to Marble Rivals and became a Luna Snowman.

1429
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,800
And your streams calmed me down before I made my driver's license.

1430
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,620
Yeah, congratulations, you can drive now.

1431
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:11,080
Congratulations, I really appreciate it.

1432
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,140
I really appreciate that you were able to get your license.

1433
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,160
Um, drive safely though.

1434
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,800
Uh, GN, thank you for the super chat.

1435
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,760
Thank you, thank you.

1436
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,820
Toki, no.

1437
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,480
No, GN, thank you for the super chat.

1438
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,280
Thank you, thank you.

1439
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:30,300
Liam, um, hypothetically, how much legal charcoal would you be in for streaming an official twitch event for on YouTube?

1440
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:31,680
None.

1441
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,720
I just stream like one of my teammates.

1442
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,380
Like, it's, I live in NA.

1443
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,940
We have, what is it called?

1444
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,840
What is it called?

1445
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,920
Fair use laws.

1446
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:48,000
Like, I'm not gonna, okay, I won't like, you, like, if I do one, I won't just drag, like, Twitch Rivals official broadcast.

1447
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:51,380
I just drag one of my team, what is my, what are my teammates gonna do?

1448
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:52,640
Copyright strike me?

1449
01:02:52,780 --> 01:03:04,520
Like, after I sacrificed myself for them, they're really gonna fucking copyright strike me if I, if I, if I watch their POV.

1450
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:11,600
Yo, thanks, yo, thanks for letting me stay on the team.

1451
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,920
That would be wild.

1452
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,440
Yeah, what a face teammate.

1453
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,340
Um, Brian, thank you for the super chat.

1454
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,160
Thank you, thank you.

1455
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,360
We'll make our own tournament.

1456
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,100
With tomatoes and memes.

1457
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,420
Thank you for the super chat.

1458
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,440
Thank you, thank you.

1459
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,820
Original, thank you for the super chat.

1460
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,500
Thank you, thank you.

1461
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,820
Thank you for taking a break from our lives.

1462
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,560
Come to the con today.

1463
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,200
My dumbass didn't even think to say my username in the meet and greet.

1464
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,380
Thank you for the super chat, original.

1465
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,200
Thank you, thank you.

1466
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:51,500
Oh my god, guys, it was, I'm so sorry if you were at the meet and greet and you got the, the meet and greet where you had to talk to me on the phone.

1467
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,980
I mean, it did feel a little more, I was trying to sell it hard.

1468
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,360
So, like, there was internet issues at first for the meet and greet.

1469
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,300
So, it, we were, the meet and greet was literally done via phone call.

1470
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,860
So, like, um, it was, like, one of the staff member's phone.

1471
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,980
And I'll be like, oh my god, it's like we're having a personal phone call right now.

1472
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,040
Phone call RP.

1473
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:16,060
And I did feel really bad.

1474
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,360
But fortunately, the convention staff, um, she spoke into your ears.

1475
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,760
I hate you all.

1476
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:31,780
But, um, um, anyway, anyway, I felt, like, really bad about it.

1477
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:34,820
And just, like, it was supposed to be, like, on a monitor.

1478
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:41,040
And, um, so, like, the staff, the staff told us, like, oh yeah, we, we, we told them it was okay.

1479
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,040
They're all okay.

1480
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,180
They can get a refund and stuff like that.

1481
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,340
So, I was like, okay, that makes me feel a lot better, you know.

1482
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,820
Like, I was like, oh my god, at least, like, a refund was offered.

1483
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,440
But, um, after that, um, we swapped to the actual monitors.

1484
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,000
I'm jealous more.

1485
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,120
It's not professional, Dexy.

1486
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,760
I can't, we can't have, guys, I don't know.

1487
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:14,640
I feel like phone call meeting greets just feels like, it just, it just feels like budget.

1488
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,020
Like, you know, I feel really bad because they paid for it, too.

1489
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,300
And I feel like you paid for, like, a phone call.

1490
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,680
Um, um, we won the phone call experience.

1491
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:35,760
Um, but yeah, yeah, we can corner the market.

1492
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,840
I still have a chance.

1493
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,880
Please speak into my ears next.

1494
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,480
Okay, Navi, thank you for the super chat.

1495
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,420
Thank you, thank you.

1496
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,640
Cass, thank you for the super chat.

1497
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,360
Thank you, thank you.

1498
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,020
Mushy Mushy, is this Doki bird?

1499
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1500
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,040
Thank you, thank you.

1501
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,660
Um, um, Dania, thank you for the super chat.

1502
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:55,700
Thank you, thank you.

1503
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,340
Doki rivals tournament win.

1504
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,360
Do only small concurrents so it's not so pricey.

1505
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,260
Thank you for the super chat.

1506
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,440
Thank you, thank you.

1507
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,700
I like having a mix of both so that, like, you know, it's easier to host more of them in the future, too.

1508
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,940
Uh, Shia, thank you.

1509
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,840
And I also like, you know, having, you have, okay, here's the reason why you have to mix both.

1510
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:22,720
If you have all smalls, small streamers, no, I'm so sorry, but like, you won't have a lot of eyes on that tournament.

1511
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:28,960
So it's also good, the bigger CCTV is also good, so that's why I like to mix, have a mixture of both.

1512
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:43,140
So, you know, if there's bigger content creators and smaller content creators, you know, it allows a chance for the smaller content creators to have a chance to shine in front of the audience from the bigger content creators.

1513
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,860
So, like, so that's why I like having both, like, just try to have, like, a mixture of both in there.

1514
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,340
Um, Shrom, thank you for the super chat.

1515
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,020
Thank you, thank you.

1516
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:57,460
We're trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.

1517
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,920
Thank you for the super chat.

1518
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,880
Thank you, thank you.

1519
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,440
Melio, thank you for the super chat.

1520
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,140
Thank you, thank you.

1521
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:02,980
Is this Doughkeeper?

1522
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,080
No, this is Patrick.

1523
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1524
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:05,900
Thank you, thank you.

1525
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,620
Coyote, thank you for the super chat.

1526
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:08,600
Thank you, thank you.

1527
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,420
Scuff only makes it feel even more exactly.

1528
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,800
It's more authentic to the Doughkeeper experience.

1529
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,560
Gia, thank you for the super chat.

1530
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:17,300
Thank you, thank you.

1531
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:28,720
Paying for this kind of scuff in my meet and greet, you're like, please, internet, be shitty, so I can have my phone call meet and greet, so I can talk to her on the phone.

1532
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,160
Oh my god, we're tight like that.

1533
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,600
Honestly, true.

1534
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:43,720
You're like, please, internet, be shitty, so I can call her on the phone.

1535
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,100
When do we get text message meet and greet?

1536
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:49,980
Oh my god.

1537
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,140
Okay, that's not super chat.

1538
01:07:51,200 --> 01:08:04,260
I read it because that just... Do you know, like, okay, I know this because I have a friend who's friends with OnlyFanModels and, like, okay, I'm gonna, like, okay, I'm sorry if you subscribe to Only...

1539
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,460
Like, if you're an OnlyFan subscriber, but, like, I'm here to break your fucking world view.

1540
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,360
But, like, I don't know if this is, like, an ad.

1541
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:19,820
Like, I don't know if this is, like, supposed to be, like, a company secret, but if it is, that's right.

1542
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,900
See me on the news next month.

1543
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,020
I'm exposing everything.

1544
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,500
Now I know how to do it.

1545
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:46,220
Anyway, um, um, so, like, you know how, like, some OnlyFan girls, they would do it so that they would be, like, you pay more, you get more, uh, you get, uh, like, personal DMs from personal DMs from, like, the OnlyFanModels.

1546
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,760
You're not getting it from the OnlyFanModels.

1547
01:08:50,240 --> 01:09:02,760
A lot of them actually, like, hire assistants, sometimes men, to, like, DM, like, reply back to, like, hundreds of people and, like, pretend fake RP.

1548
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,920
Oh, it's them as the model!

1549
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:27,700
Yeah, so, like, um, it's, yeah, so, it's, like, they pay, like, $500 more so you can have a personal one-on-one talk with one of the models, but it's not actually, it's never actually them.

1550
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,600
It's...

1551
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,180
Like, I didn't, no, I didn't know, because I was like, you can just do that?

1552
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,720
Lie on the internet like that?

1553
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:45,580
Like, because they give a super chat, they can take 1-900, don't keep your chat line.

1554
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,880
I was like, oh my god, like...

1555
01:09:52,220 --> 01:10:01,180
And then they would, like, roleplay and pretend to be the girl and stuff, and they'll, like, just, uh, um, who would I thought?

1556
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:13,180
I don't know, because I would think, like, oh my god, if, like, a guy pays, like, a thousand dollars to have a chance to, like, talk to somebody personal one-on-one, and it's, I just, I don't know, I'm too pure.

1557
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,680
I would be like, you can just scam them like that?

1558
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:26,360
Like, like... But then I was like, but it makes sense, because, like, hundreds of men are also playing, like, or women, you know, are women.

1559
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:33,180
Some women likes what they see, and they'll just be, like, you know, hundreds of them pay, like, a thousand plus dollars.

1560
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:40,360
So, like, obviously, you don't have the time to, like, RP to, like, you know, sex them.

1561
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,440
Um...

1562
01:10:44,260 --> 01:11:03,320
So, yeah, you could be chatting up some fucking poor assistant that's barely being paid a minimum wage, um, that's, like, fake RP, role-playing with you, and be like, yeah, man, that's so hot, oh my god, and they're just, like, sitting up, like, and they're just,

1563
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:18,620
like, sitting on their PC on, like, in an office space, just, like, with a cigarette in their hand, and, like, um, a cigarette and coffee on the other, and just be, like, oh my god, that's so hot, like, what else do you want to do?

1564
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:32,000
And then after they finish typing that, they tab to a different conversation, and be, like, what are you wearing, and then they swap to another tab, and be, like, oh my god, are you done yet?

1565
01:11:48,300 --> 01:12:06,640
Like, they just keep, they just, like, swapping tabs and everything, and and then, and then on a separate tab, they're out there playing, like, Minesweeper while they're, they're, like, waiting for the next reply, and just playing Minesweeper at their desk,

1566
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:13,660
or, like, reading through Twitter, scrolling through Twitter and stuff, and just be, like, oh, oh shit, Michael replied, what did they say?

1567
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:20,060
All right, okay, okay, a $50 tip, what does a $50 tip give?

1568
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:31,860
All right, okay, um, send a panty picture, opens a folder with hundreds of panty picture, but you tell them, oh, I just took this for you, copy-paste, like,

1569
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:45,160
how they would think it's personal, but then it's a folder full of pre-made pictures.

1570
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,240
Um, um, all right,

1571
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:59,280
I mean, they didn't lie, you're destroying their immersion, um,

1572
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,400
damn, Michael, you're a freak, sorry, where I put that folder?

1573
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,120
Solid steak, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1574
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:18,020
They have automated messaging, as well as prompts and guides for texting and upping stuff is, how do you know that even?

1575
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:24,000
Solid snake, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, but also, how do you know so much too?

1576
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:33,460
How do you know about these guides and upping prices?

1577
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:41,220
I like how some people are like, oh my god, wait, that sounds, how do I get started being an assistant for an OnlyFans girl?

1578
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,660
He's, snake, do you work for one?

1579
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,820
Um, uh, Usagi, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1580
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,700
You're holding out on us with that phone roleplay, huh?

1581
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,900
I respect for sticking to your guns, kid.

1582
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:07,680
You made the right decision, of course, I'm nobody, so take that for what it's worth, and I won't play some rounds, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1583
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:12,840
Um, um, wait, solid snake, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1584
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,360
I am the one that mods this.

1585
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:19,420
Wait, wait, real?

1586
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:34,120
Wait, oh my god, what I think is funny is that you do that, you get paid, and you come here to super chat.

1587
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:41,200
You're like, make this, oh my god, you give me dirty money.

1588
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,200
It's all right, it's all right, I take all kinds of money.

1589
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:54,500
It's all right, I take all kinds, I have, I'm shameless, I have no standards, that's okay.

1590
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:01,920
I have no standards, guys, it's all right, all money is good money.

1591
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,780
You do you.

1592
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,900
I'll clean the money later.

1593
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,300
It's like, it's like, it's like, you know, like...

1594
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:32,100
Um, you know, like, the, I, like, it makes me think about, like, you know, like, you know, like people with dollar bills, and like, making it rain, and then the strippers have to, like, you know, take that money, and then use that money later, and then,

1595
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:38,960
but they don't know, we don't know when they use, they're like, this is stripper money, but you don't know it's stripper money, because like, how would you know?

1596
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,640
Like, you could hold up a dollar bill, and be like, one dollar bill, and be like, has this been on a stripper?

1597
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,140
You don't know, unless it's new, new bills, and this...

1598
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:54,540
Money is money, you don't know that, this dollar bill could have gone anywhere.

1599
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,680
This dollar bill could have gone anywhere.

1600
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:07,500
Um, look, work is work, plus you get insurance?

1601
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:12,260
Okay, where do you, where do we sign up?

1602
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,660
I, what if I, that could be my side hustle, just for the insurance.

1603
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,100
Whoa, that's better than, like, other jobs here.

1604
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:33,020
Like, honestly, a job that gives you insurance is so much better than anything, than a lot of jobs.

1605
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,220
Do you get dental?

1606
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,800
Do you, dude, look, I, can I give them my CV?

1607
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,420
You, you lucky motherfucker.

1608
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,400
Blazing gun, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1609
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,660
I work at a Taco Bell, and there is a strip club down the street, so I get those dollars a lot.

1610
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,560
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1611
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,540
Like, I'm doing a chat, I was like, wait, you're hiring, are you hiring?

1612
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,280
Oh my God, um, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1613
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:13,040
Oh my God, uh, thank you for the super chat, thank you.

1614
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,440
Holy shit, guys, these are like crucifax days.

1615
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,060
Also, Mackle, I am not gonna read that, but what the fuck?

1616
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:32,080
No, I've heard, I've heard, like, stories about that, too, because they're just like, or they just buy it off of, like, Amazon, and be like, I totally did that.

1617
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,460
I'm like, holy shit, I'm back.

1618
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,180
Okay, but, like, how much did she get?

1619
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,880
There's, there has to be, there's no way she did it for less than a hundred grand.

1620
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,060
There's no fucking way.

1621
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,160
That's actually crazy, like, that's, that's so insane.

1622
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:55,000
There's no way she'd do that for, okay, maybe a hundred grand, I'm asking too much.

1623
01:17:55,080 --> 01:18:07,600
I don't know if a hundred grand is something that means I'm asking way too much, but, like, I feel like, I feel, Jesus did not type for this.

1624
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,100
Jesus did not type.

1625
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,800
What a wild statement.

1626
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,780
Oh my god, thank you for the super chat.

1627
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,940
Oh my god, is that?

1628
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,560
No, no, it's not.

1629
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:32,480
I make enough to, thankfully, I'm not desperate.

1630
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:37,260
Okay, I, I'm just happy the internet was a mistake.

1631
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,500
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

1632
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,140
Thank you, thank you.

1633
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:45,800
I'm happy to make enough money where, like, I don't care about being a mill- I don't care about being a millionaire.

1634
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:46,820
That's all I'm gonna say.

1635
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,220
I don't care about being a millionaire.

1636
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,660
I care more about having a million subscribers than I do about being a millionaire.

1637
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,780
I like reinvesting into things.

1638
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,820
I just want to be able to live comfortably.

1639
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,260
I just want to be able to live- I'm not greedy for money.

1640
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,320
I just want to be able to live comfortably.

1641
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,820
I want my dog to be able to live comfortably.

1642
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:11,200
I don't want to worry about the future or anything because she's a billionaire.

1643
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,400
Don't listen to her.

1644
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,080
So, like, I don't care.

1645
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:21,620
I don't- I'm not gonna be like, I need to do all of this.

1646
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,740
Like, I'm gonna die before I can use my millions of dollars.

1647
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:33,560
Like, I'm not a millionaire, but, like, I'm gonna die before- What about your family or your future?

1648
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:38,620
You're- you're, like, children's children's children.

1649
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,320
Look, I- I don't care.

1650
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,860
Like, Bill Gates doesn't give a fuck.

1651
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,000
Why should- Okay, that's fucked up.

1652
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,770
Bill Gates doesn't give money to his kids, so why should I?

1653
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,380
Damn!

1654
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:02,140
Whoa!

1655
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,640
That's a bad example.

1656
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,040
That's a mess.

1657
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,340
Um, anyway.

1658
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:23,820
Yeah, anyway, as I was- as I was saying, um, um, I just- I don't know.

1659
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:24,500
I don't know.

1660
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,360
I feel like maybe, like, I don't know.

1661
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,040
I don't know if I would- I don't know.

1662
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,400
I've always, like, been, like, fuck children.

1663
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,080
Like, I- I don't know.

1664
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:35,860
I don't know what's gonna happen in the future.

1665
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,240
She's single forever.

1666
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,260
I'm gonna be, like- I'm gonna be, like, 90.

1667
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,800
And you know how, like, there's, like, crazy cat ladies?

1668
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:56,240
Um, I'll be, like, a crazy- a crazy dog lady with, like, 10 wiener dogs.

1669
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:03,540
Like, I'll be, like- And then- and then, like, when I cease to exist, I'd be, like, in my will.

1670
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:10,260
I- I- I will the remains of my- my money to my 10 wiener dogs.

1671
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,280
And-

1672
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:22,020
They get to have- they get to have my- my- my house.

1673
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:33,520
And, like, and the maid and the caretaker- Three- no, each wiener dog shall have their own caretaker.

1674
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:41,460
And- And they shall be paid from the remains of my- my bank account.

1675
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:51,760
But, uh, these- you- they must- they must carry on the Doe Keeper linguage.

1676
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,780
And they must have children.

1677
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,920
Uh, wait, don't be neutered, JK.

1678
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,040
Don't be neutered.

1679
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:10,020
But you shall must- if the caretaker's wiener dog dies, they must replace that wiener dog and continue his- his generation.

1680
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,520
Until the caretaker retires.

1681
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:24,140
Then, they shall- they must take care of the- their last remaining wiener dog until its death.

1682
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:29,860
And they- Continue the bloodline.

1683
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,620
Or I ran out of money in the bank account.

1684
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:38,800
Or- It's that they either take care of the wiener dogs until they die.

1685
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,260
Until, like, they retire.

1686
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:46,260
And, like, they can keep the dog until- until it ceases to exist.

1687
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,660
Or- or there's just no more money in the bank account.

1688
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,360
Then I don't know what you're gonna do with the dog.

1689
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,280
I don't- I don't know.

1690
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,060
Then- and the care- oh, the care- Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1691
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:00,500
Thank you.

1692
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,040
Thank you.

1693
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,340
The generational wiener dogs.

1694
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,440
That's where my money's gonna go.

1695
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,260
Um, Kaz, the caretakers will be buried with their wiener masters.

1696
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1697
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:11,600
Thank you.

1698
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:12,200
Thank you.

1699
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,980
MHS, thank you for the super chat.

1700
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:14,320
Thank you.

1701
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:14,720
Thank you.

1702
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,000
Yep.

1703
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,000
That's my Oshie.

1704
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,320
Just like the Egyptians.

1705
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,920
I'm bringing it back.

1706
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,140
I don't know why we stopped in the first place.

1707
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:27,540
Like, you know how, like, in Egyptian times, um, Can you adopt me?

1708
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,700
I can be a wiener dog for you, my queen.

1709
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,200
Navi, thank you for the super chat.

1710
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:32,500
Thank you.

1711
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:32,980
Thank you.

1712
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:45,620
You know in Egyptian times, every time, like, a royal person dies, they, like, kill their pets and, like, their- their favorite- their favorite servant and be like, you have to die for- Literally, that's- it's fucked up.

1713
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,260
They're like, you shall- you- and if he dies, you die.

1714
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:53,300
Hey, so they basically get, like, buried.

1715
01:23:53,900 --> 01:24:02,080
Uh, they get buried, um, with their owners and we should bring it- I don't know why we don't bring it back.

1716
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,200
I don't- I feel like that's so romantic, guys.

1717
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,660
I feel like- Toki, no.

1718
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,660
Marsha, thank you for the super chat.

1719
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,140
Thank you.

1720
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:12,960
Thank you.

1721
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,360
My money comes from something far more serious.

1722
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:17,760
The state of France.

1723
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,220
Marsha, thank you for the super chat.

1724
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:20,700
Thank you.

1725
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,480
Thank you.

1726
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:26,900
All I'm saying is that I don't understand why we stopped doing that practice.

1727
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,320
I thought it was a pretty neat practice.

1728
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,720
That's all I'm saying.

1729
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:31,860
Whoa.

1730
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:32,740
Oh my god.

1731
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:35,040
I can't believe I've been chatting for, like, so long.

1732
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:35,700
Oh my god.

1733
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:40,820
We've been at it for a while now, but I really had a good time talking to you guys.

1734
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,140
I had a great time just hanging out with everybody.

1735
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,520
I didn't even call it here.

1736
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,060
I just said this is gonna be, like, a pretty short stream today.

1737
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:53,680
Um, I hope you guys had a fun time just listening to me yap.

1738
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,320
Um, yap.

1739
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,900
Even though it was short, I'm sorry it was really short, guys.

1740
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,780
I'm really sorry.

1741
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,580
Um, I do want to rest a little bit today.

1742
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,980
Um, since now it is considering my free day, I'm gonna go rest now.

1743
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,980
Uh, Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

1744
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:08,320
Thank you.

1745
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:08,900
Thank you.

1746
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,940
Toki, I had so much fun talking to you today.

1747
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,780
I wanted to tell you so much and forgot because I had so much fun yapping with you.

1748
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,740
Oh, baby, lucky enough to do this again one day.

1749
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,240
Also, Miku Fortnite went.

1750
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,800
Oh my god, Miku, Miku, ba-da-dum.

1751
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:25,220
That was, like, that's been stuck in my head because it's the Fortnite skin now, but...

1752
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,400
Thank y'all for coming.

1753
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,480
Thank y'all for letting me.

1754
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:33,120
I was gonna play Toroba today because that's why I was like, maybe I'll do some retail therapy.

1755
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,580
But now I'm like, you know what?

1756
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,080
No, we'll do that another time.

1757
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:42,260
I bought, like, $30 of worth of, uh, points for it, but...

1758
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,780
We'll do that another time.

1759
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,260
Maybe we'll do it next week and have it an unofficial scheduled stream.

1760
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:56,100
Um, um, anyway, guys, uh, uh, I had a great time talking to all you guys.

1761
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,040
I hope you guys had a great time hanging out with me.

1762
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,380
And I'll tell you, thank you for the super chat.

1763
01:25:59,460 --> 01:25:59,700
Thank you.

1764
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,120
Thank you.

1765
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,380
Thanks for the financial advisement, everyone.

1766
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,440
I'll consider the many options moving forward.

1767
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,060
Go for the one that provides health insurance!

1768
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:11,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1769
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,080
Thank you.

1770
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:12,840
Thank you.

1771
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,380
Um, Panzer, thank you for the super chat.

1772
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:15,860
Thank you.

1773
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:16,580
Thank you.

1774
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:20,400
Uh, since I watch you at work, this is considered a business expense.

1775
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1776
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,040
Thank you.

1777
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:22,660
Thank you.

1778
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,880
Riku, thank you for the super chat.

1779
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:25,240
Thank you.

1780
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:25,860
Thank you.

1781
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,180
Guess it's a good thing that your brain is home.

1782
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,460
Oh, thank you for the super chat.

1783
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:29,780
Thank you.

1784
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:30,180
Thank you.

1785
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,740
All right, guys, I'm gonna head off now.

1786
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,720
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1787
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:34,340
Posture check.

1788
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,000
Get up and move around and get that blood flowing.

1789
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,080
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

1790
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,580
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1791
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,460
Bye, guys.

1792
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,320
Bye!
