1
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,320
One tells a lie, the other tells the truth.

2
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,840
Which kitty could it be?

3
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,960
Which kitty could it be?

4
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,640
So like, as you guys know, I was looping because I have to wait for Mint a little bit.

5
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,060
So...

6
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,660
Oh yeah, she waited for Mint, you guys.

7
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:08,160
Okay, she read out what she was typing and she was like, I'm looping because of Mint.

9
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,220
But literally right before that, she said...

10
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,560
I said like, don't worry, Mint, I'll wait for you.

11
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,740
No, you didn't!

12
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,420
That's what I said, right?

13
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Yeah, that's literally what I said before I typed it out.

14
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,260
She said, I'm looping because I need more time.

15
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
And then she wrote out what she typed.

16
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,220
And then I sent mine before her.

17
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,660
Alright, so one tells a truth, the other tells a lie.

18
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,460
Which kitty could it be?

19
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,920
I think they know.

20
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,740
I think they know.

21
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,100
Yeah, I think they know.

22
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,640
And it starts with the letter M.

23
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Mokey bird.

24
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,940
Mokey bird.

25
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,720
Mokey bird.

26
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,360
Ah yes, my favorite type of bird.

27
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,300
Yeah.

28
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,520
Yeah.

29
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,020
Guys, I'm cheating right now because instead of drinking alcohol...

30
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,940
Guys, I don't want...

31
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,440
I don't know.

32
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,780
I don't want to feel like an alcoholic if I'm drinking for the third time of the week.

33
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,720
Like...

34
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,320
A week?

35
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,660
What else have you been doing?

36
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,560
No, like, every time we've done massage, I was drinking.

37
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,620
And I'm like, do I really want to drink again?

38
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,080
That's...

39
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
That's three weeks.

40
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,860
That's not three times this week.

41
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,680
Okay, but it's...

42
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,940
I usually don't drink that much per, like, year.

43
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,660
So...

44
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,360
Oh, okay.

45
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,940
That's fair.

46
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,620
So, sorry.

47
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,780
Third time in a week.

48
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,260
Wait, no.

49
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,480
Week at 10.

50
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm so tired.

51
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,080
She doesn't...

52
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,020
She doesn't need the alcohol, you guys.

53
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,900
She's already drunk.

54
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,240
Guys, I don't need the alcohol.

55
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm already...

56
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,000
Mentally, I'm already there.

57
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,260
Like...

58
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm drinking bubble tea instead.

59
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,040
Yeah, we're both.

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,560
That sounds good.

61
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:42,960
What can I do?

62
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,700
I got the honey, um, milk green tea.

63
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,000
Can I have a sip?

64
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,780
Yeah.

65
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Want me to regurgitate it to you like a bird?

66
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,020
Yeah.

67
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,280
Ahhhh.

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
That's how cats do it too, right?

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Oh my god, wait, don't remind me of birds.

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,580
I know.

71
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,460
I cried earlier.

72
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,400
I watched...

73
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,420
So, there's this like...

74
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,840
There's this eagle couple that I've been watching.

75
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,420
Yeah.

76
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,260
And they've had a nest for 20 years.

77
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:15,780
Yeah?

78
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,120
What?

79
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,000
So, you're like...

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,820
You're like basically a creep.

81
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Like a little creeper.

82
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,480
Watching them in the...

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,120
Like in a corner.

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,240
Yeah.

85
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,940
Okay.

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,220
And they've had this nest for 20 years.

87
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,280
And then, like, just the other day, there was a really bad storm and their nest fell.

88
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,680
They can just...

89
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
But can't they just make a new...

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
Wait, are the eggs okay?

91
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,020
Their nest was for...

92
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,360
No, the eggs, they all died.

93
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,920
How do you know?

94
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,400
Because it's like a...

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,140
It's like a...

96
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,260
It's like a bald eagle.

97
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,180
Oh.

98
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,760
Couple.

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,280
And so, they're like...

100
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,020
Protected by this...

101
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,200
Wait, why didn't they stop it?

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,660
I'm bringing the mood down here.

103
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,340
I'm bringing the mood down here.

104
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,720
Wait, so like, why didn't they stop it?

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,180
Why did they get involved?

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,960
Because it's like...

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,220
You can't get involved in nature.

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,760
Why not?

109
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Because, that's like, you know, that's...

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,480
I don't know.

111
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,200
I think they're bad people.

112
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,200
I think they're bad people!

113
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:12,900
I think they're bad people!

114
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:12,960
Yeah, exactly.

115
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,760
Why didn't they just...

116
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,520
You know, just get out of that camera and just, you know, hold the nest together.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,960
Hold the nest out.

118
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,820
They should have put some little, like, what's it called?

119
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Super glue.

120
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,340
Come on.

121
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
Super glue the nest.

122
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,320
And I'm like, wow, my nest is so strong.

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,300
It hasn't been broken since in 20 years.

124
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,580
It was so sad, too, because the bird, one of them was, like, laying in the nest.

125
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,460
And then you just watch her go down.

126
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,320
What?

127
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,580
You watched the bird?

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,480
Would you watch it live if the bird just go down with the nest?

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,540
Yeah, she was okay, though.

130
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,620
But then they, like, came back and they were, like, looking at where the nest was supposed to be.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,180
And they were, like, all sad.

132
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,900
Oh, wait, how long do bald eagles live anyway?

133
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,660
So it's been there for 20 years, right?

134
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,100
How long do bald...

135
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,460
Because if they're about, you know, they're at the end of their lifespan, then this should be...

136
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,980
It should be fine.

137
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,100
They, you know, they have time for them to go through...

138
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,200
20 to 30 years.

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,260
So, like, wait in the world, it's around 20 years.

140
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,860
So, like, maybe that's why they didn't intervene.

141
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,640
Because they're like, well, they've had a good 20 years, you know?

142
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,080
They live around 20 years.

143
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,240
So, like...

144
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,340
So, so everybody knows that if Doki is taking care of you and believes that you're at the end of your lifespan, she'll just give up on you.

145
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,040
Yeah, you've lived a good life.

146
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,220
Yeah, you've lived a good life.

147
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm just saying, you've lived a good life.

148
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,540
I mean...

149
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,280
That's it, that's it for you.

150
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,380
Doki Bird says you're at your average lifespan.

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:44,980
Goodbye.

152
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:45,720
Yeah.

153
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,700
We need the space for something new.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,440
We need that.

155
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,660
Um...

156
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm thinking about them birds.

157
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,120
I was crying.

158
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,320
I saw I was crying earlier about it.

159
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,720
Oh my god, it was like, yeah, it's almost like, it's like that old couple in the Titanic.

160
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,260
Yeah.

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

162
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,840
I'll never let go.

163
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,820
I'll never let go.

164
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,660
She really didn't.

165
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:05,920
Yeah.

166
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,880
She went down with the nest.

167
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,720
She went down with the nest.

168
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,100
Now, where was the husband in all of this?

169
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,000
Why wasn't he there?

170
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,740
Typical man behavior.

171
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,760
I know, right?

172
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,340
Didn't go down with her.

173
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,880
Like, I can't believe it.

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,560
He, I bet he was in a shelter with, in a different nest, too.

175
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,380
Don't say that!

176
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,440
Don't say that!

177
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,420
They're loyal!

178
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,020
Why wasn't, why wasn't he there with her?

179
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,120
Coincidence?

180
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,360
Why wasn't he there?

181
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh my god.

182
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:43,300
I'm saying, there was a huge storm and the husband isn't there to check on his wife during the biggest storm of their lives.

183
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,820
Of their lives.

184
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,240
The end of their lives.

185
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,700
The end of our lives.

186
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,740
At the end of their lives too.

187
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,580
I mean, they live around 20 years.

188
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
They're getting there.

189
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,720
What if it wasn't even a storm?

190
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,660
What if he was on the other side of the tree, like, shaking it?

191
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,920
He was just like, damn!

192
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,420
It's like, the last batch of eggs.

193
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,940
I can't go through another.

194
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,320
I can't...

195
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,450
He was like, this is the last one.

196
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,450
Now he can be a free bird.

197
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,930
No more kids.

198
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,850
Free meditated.

199
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,830
Bird-er.

200
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,610
That's what it is.

201
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,670
It's bird-er.

202
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,050
Oh my god, it's a bird of passion.

203
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,000
I was like, you guys are the worst and you're included with me.

204
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,480
No!

205
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,160
You're guilty by association.

206
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,020
I brought it up.

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,580
You know what?

208
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,320
I'll take this.

209
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,200
I'll take this one.

210
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,860
Alright, anyway.

211
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,440
Today we're playing the Dolores chapter.

212
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,260
But most likely we might not be finishing the Dolores chapter today.

213
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
Depending on how long... how it goes.

214
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,960
Because Min has to leave.

215
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,240
Um... has to leave at a set time.

216
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,280
So...

217
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,660
No.

218
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,140
If we don't finish it by then...

219
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,080
I guess we'll never finish the...

220
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,520
No!

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,120
They're gonna be so mad!

222
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,900
We'll see you next year.

223
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
We'll see you next year.

224
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
The anniversary.

225
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,660
ever shoot.

226
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,500
Wait...

227
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,960
I think you can get it done.

228
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,560
Just be brave.

229
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,380
Oh my god!

230
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,080
But it's the longest and scariest chapter!

231
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,220
I don't think it's the scariest.

232
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,900
They said it's the scariest!

233
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,780
No!

234
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,420
We...

235
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,580
The bathroom one was the scariest.

236
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,320
We said the bathroom one?

237
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,340
No!

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,020
I said both of them are really...

239
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,360
I think like, apparently, like, the...

240
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,120
what was her name?

241
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,520
Lucy!

242
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,100
Lucy!

243
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:46,680
Lucy!

244
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,120
I had to get into dad mode.

245
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,740
I was like, what did the dad use today?

246
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,000
Lucy, where are you?

247
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,600
Lucy!

248
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,680
I think, like, the Lucy chapter is supposed to be more jump-scary, and then the Dolores chapter apparently is more psychological fear.

249
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,460
Oh, that's not scary.

250
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,560
So there's, like, more suspense.

251
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,060
You're not the one playing him.

252
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,260
I played Minecraft earlier, that's literally a horror game.

253
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,680
Oh, so scary, Minecraft.

254
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,060
You don't know the Kraken.

255
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,520
Excuse me, it's Craft Mine, not Minecraft.

256
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,280
Oh, yeah.

257
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,640
I played Craft Mine.

258
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,660
Oh, yeah?

259
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,300
I played the Jack Black game mode, which was very bad.

260
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,640
Oh, did you actually?

261
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,400
It was made for... it was actually made for kids.

262
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,540
Oh.

263
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,700
Alright.

264
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,080
I mean, that's the Minecraft movie.

265
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,200
It's supposed to be for kids.

266
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,460
That's the Minecraft movie.

267
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,540
Yeah.

268
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,520
You know the Minecraft movie is about to become the number one best-selling video game movie?

269
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,860
You know that?

270
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,880
Oh, what is it... what is it gonna be?

271
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,320
Mario?

272
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,940
Um, I think... wasn't Mario the best... I thought it was... I think it was Mario.

273
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,220
Okay.

274
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,860
Best-selling video game movie.

275
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,680
She stalling again?

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,180
Um, no, because you asked me a question, and I'm just trying to answer your question.

277
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,440
Like, yeah, it was Mario.

278
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,660
Right now, it's at seven... wait... it's at 720... million dollars.

279
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,320
Wait, I thought it made billions so far.

280
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,480
Oh, it's closer to a billion dollars already.

281
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,620
It's getting close to a billion dollars.

282
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,760
Wait, that's three days ago.

283
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,800
So it should be a billion dollars now.

284
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,120
A billion dollars?

285
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,040
A billion, bajillion, million dollars.

286
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,160
Why do you say it like that?

287
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,620
That's a lot of money.

288
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,160
That's a lot of money.

289
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,640
Yeah!

290
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,200
See guys, I don't need alcohol to be stupid.

291
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,160
Yeah!

292
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,480
Okay, let's start.

293
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm just mentally exhausted right now.

294
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,100
Okay.

295
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,180
Alright, let's...

296
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,220
That's the same as being drunk.

297
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,440
Yeah, honestly, yeah.

298
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,520
Alright, continue.

299
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:59,440
Alright, I remember the biggest issue is that we ran out of all materials and stuff for this game.

300
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,440
So, like, that's what I'm scared about.

301
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,400
I have zero meds.

302
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,160
I have zero meds and, uh, no lighters, but, like, a kajillion light bulbs.

303
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,440
Oh, I forgot.

304
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,060
I was like, oh my god, what the fuck is that?

305
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,040
I forgot that's the Holy Mary.

306
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,660
I have so many light bulbs.

307
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,260
Some light bulbs.

308
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,080
I don't know what to do with all of these light bulbs.

309
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,240
We can find more things.

310
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,700
Probably.

311
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,240
I hate this game.

312
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,760
Alright.

313
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Where's Grandma?

314
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,720
I should have played Layers of Fear instead of Visage.

315
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,620
I should have said...

316
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,740
Layers of Fear is nothing.

317
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,300
Yeah, that's why I should have said Layers of Fear instead of Visage.

318
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,840
Oh...

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,060
Wait, someone said...

320
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,180
Oh!

321
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,540
Your reminder that the storage room in the basement exists with supplies.

322
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay.

323
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,260
I guess I go there.

324
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,780
I think it also refreshes every...

325
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,240
After every chapter, no?

326
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,880
Does it?

327
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:52,900
What?

328
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,540
I don't know.

329
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,420
I've lost track.

330
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,800
I don't know.

331
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't remember where.

332
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:58,680
Grandma.

333
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,420
How do I get there?

334
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,300
Grandma.

335
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:02,980
Grandma.

336
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,620
The basement?

337
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,400
Right here?

338
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:04,840
Oh.

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,460
Is it here?

340
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,620
Yes.

341
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,160
Because there's a...

342
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,140
To this...

343
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,500
Right?

344
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,040
Oh, here.

345
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,400
Where's the light?

347
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,100
Oh, there it is.

348
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
I forgot that...

349
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,760
Whoa.

350
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,780
Did that just turn on by itself?

351
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,180
Yeah.

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,480
Yeah.

353
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:19,920
Yeah, it did.

354
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,500
And I don't like that.

355
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,060
It might be the storage.

356
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
That does not make me happy.

357
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,880
That does not bring me joy.

358
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,380
Open the door.

359
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,140
See if it's the storage.

360
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,880
Is that the storage?

361
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,780
I don't remember.

362
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,880
I don't know.

363
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,700
No, it's locked.

364
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,920
I have no basement key.

365
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,780
Don't you have a basement key?

366
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,220
No.

367
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,260
Oh.

368
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,220
What's this?

369
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,800
Basement key.

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,640
Probably not.

371
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,900
What is it?

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,740
Basement key.

373
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,700
No, it's not.

374
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,220
Uh huh.

375
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,740
Uh huh.

376
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,640
Oh.

377
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,540
Why is it so dark in here?

378
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,780
Yeah, why is it so dark?

379
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:56,920
Oh.

380
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,700
Hey!

381
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,000
It's the storage!

382
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,620
Exactly!

383
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,220
Exactly what I said!

384
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,260
No, it's not the storage.

385
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,280
Oh, look it's a comic book page.

386
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh.

387
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,420
The neighbors page?

388
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,100
What the hell is that about?

389
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,980
I don't fucking know.

390
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,740
That's not the...

391
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,460
This is not the storage area, you liar.

392
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,260
I don't even have...

393
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,020
Yes, it is.

394
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,460
Oh, you got a chainsaw.

395
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,500
It literally is...

396
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,120
Chainsaw.

397
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,180
Is someone walking above us?

398
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,500
I don't know.

399
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,640
No.

400
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,300
No.

401
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,060
Where's the light?

402
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,760
Is this the light for this?

403
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,480
No, is this the light?

404
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,240
We're not even in the chapter.

405
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,540
Nothing can hurt us right now, right?

406
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,500
I don't know.

407
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,840
I don't know.

408
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,740
I don't know if I'm not okay.

409
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm not okay right now.

410
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,880
Maybe you do need the alcohol.

411
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,800
Do you have any?

412
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,740
Yeah, I do.

413
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,740
It's always there.

414
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,780
It's always there.

415
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,260
Just in case of emergency.

416
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,020
I like that people said to go to the storage, but did not tell us where it is.

417
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,020
Yeah, this is your fault.

418
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,980
People who told me to go here.

419
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,560
What?

420
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,080
What's wrong?

421
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,320
The light turned off, so I guess I don't go there no more.

422
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,400
We're back upstairs?

423
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,900
We're back upstairs.

424
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,780
I'm like not... I'm so stressed out right now.

425
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,640
Don't be stressed.

426
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,520
What's that?

427
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,440
I don't know.

428
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,250
Or even is it a grandma story?

429
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,330
I don't know why it's a jam.

430
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:55,650
I don't know why it's a jam.

431
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,190
Nothing's going on.

432
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,010
Nothing's happening.

433
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,710
You're just going in circles now.

434
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,450
I don't.

435
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,890
I'm so confused.

436
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,390
If you go to the left, you get to the TV room.

437
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,830
See?

438
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,310
They're there.

439
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,510
There's a TV room.

440
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,410
Maybe there's something over here.

441
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,270
Oh, that's the laundry room.

442
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,130
This is the laundry room.

443
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,350
That's Dad's office room.

444
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,090
That's the office room.

445
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,530
Or actually... Oh wait, no.

446
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,750
The key to that room was in Dad's office room.

447
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,350
It's locked.

448
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,190
Is this the storage room?

449
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,070
Is this the storage room?

450
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,770
No.

451
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,850
It's a boiler room?

452
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,430
What is that?

453
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,370
Oh, man.

454
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,950
I don't know.

455
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,510
Okay, just start the story then.

456
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,150
No!

457
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,610
Wait, wait.

458
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,750
What about that door right there?

459
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,010
This door?

460
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,490
No, that one.

461
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:49,930
Oh, wait.

462
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,510
There's the storage room.

463
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,570
The

464
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,200
storage!

465
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,540
Check the rest of the room!

466
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:02,970
Storage!

467
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,790
We have to look around.

468
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,960
What's that sound?

469
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,440
What do you mean?

470
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,360
You hear that?

471
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,040
What do you mean?

472
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
What was that?

473
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,220
Stop!

474
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,220
Why am I hearing him whispering?

475
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,060
Stop!

476
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,960
I just gotta out-ghost him.

477
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,880
Can we just edit...

478
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,860
Can we just do a satsidan?

479
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,100
Let's just go back upstairs and start the game.

480
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,300
Oh, hey, there's a video.

481
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,720
Oh, you got tape!

482
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,120
Yeah.

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,940
They said...

484
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:43,960
Oh, yeah.

485
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,860
They said there's something I didn't save.

486
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
They said it would be stored.

487
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,980
Oh, my god.

488
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,840
Oh, my god.

489
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,360
Why did I do that?

490
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,420
This is the spooky part.

491
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,100
Is this the grandma?

492
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,300
No, I haven't done anything yet.

493
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,220
Oh.

494
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,640
Oh, yeah.

495
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
It's just not okay right now.

496
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,440
Oh, what the fuck?

497
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,020
I TP'd.

498
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,240
I don't want to get out of here.

499
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,400
It's inside the room with the tag on the door handle.

500
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,900
Oh, the one that...

501
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
I think we need a key to go in that, no?

502
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,260
Yeah, we don't have dad's study room.

503
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,260
Isn't it in his...

504
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,400
No, I think...

505
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,060
No, it's...

506
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,000
No, this is...

507
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,960
This starts the chapter.

508
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,520
No, I think...

509
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,540
No, the key was in the study on the second floor.

510
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:29,980
Huh?

511
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,160
At least that was what it said in the...

512
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,300
I might be making shit up.

513
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,080
I don't know, actually.

514
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know anymore.

515
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,320
It just...

516
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,880
You know the study?

517
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,520
Right there?

518
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:40,960
Yeah.

519
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,000
See if there's a key in here.

520
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
I don't know if there is or not.

521
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,680
If not, it might be fine.

522
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,240
Maybe there's stuff in here.

523
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,900
Maybe dad gave me...

524
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,140
Forgot...

525
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,820
Oh, oh, oh!

526
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,280
There is!

527
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,380
See, see, see, see, see!

528
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,180
Oh, oh!

529
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,060
Oh, oh, oh!

530
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, my God!

531
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,440
I can finally have meds!

532
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,100
Oh!

533
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,120
Now you can go back downstairs.

534
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,520
Into the basement.

535
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:01,980
Okay.

536
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,880
I haven't even started the chapter yet.

537
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,800
Well, that's the better part.

538
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,580
Then it's good that you're getting all the stuff before you start the chapter.

539
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,920
Nope, turn around.

540
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,440
There you go.

541
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,520
There you go.

542
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,580
Yippee!

543
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,340
Yippee!

544
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,820
How about like... How about like, you know...

545
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,140
This is not the storage!

546
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,860
This is the electric room!

547
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,060
The electric room!

548
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,620
Yeah!

549
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,880
The light!

550
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,820
Okay, now find things.

551
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,520
There's something.

552
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,420
Oh god, what are you looking around for?

553
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,620
Oh my god, that's a floating lighter.

554
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,820
That was a floating... yeah.

555
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,780
What's that?

556
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:43,800
What?

557
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,400
A strange frame?

558
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,320
I don't know, I'm keeping it though.

559
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,120
It's mine now.

560
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,360
What's that?

561
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:49,820
Nothing?

562
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
That's nothing.

563
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,360
Hey, that's just lights.

564
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,420
There was only a lighter in here?

565
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,880
Yeah, there was just one lighter.

566
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,480
I guess that's better than nothing, but...

567
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,000
I need meds!

568
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,360
Where's the meds?

569
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,180
I need meds!

570
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm gonna go crazy!

571
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm gonna go booga booga!

572
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,700
I...

573
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,400
The stool?

574
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
I don't need the stool!

575
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,380
I got two lighters!

576
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,380
What am I gonna do with two?

577
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,780
Yay!

578
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,600
Yay, two lighters!

579
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,740
Yay!

580
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,920
What am I gonna do with two lighters?

581
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,880
I need meds!

582
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,540
You can now start the story.

583
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,060
That's what you need to do.

584
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,140
No, I need...

585
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,340
I cannot just start the story, man.

586
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,320
What if she...

587
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,020
Yes, you can!

588
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,000
Not three lighters!

589
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,460
Three lighters!

590
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,240
Oh my god!

591
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,880
And a candle!

592
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,680
There's a candle!

593
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,360
Dual-wielding?

594
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,100
Dual-wielding?

595
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,460
Dual-wielding lighters!

596
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,900
Where are the meds?!

597
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,940
Where are the crazy people?!

598
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,360
Oh, more candles!

599
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,340
Oh, never mind.

600
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,920
Are the...

601
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,780
I thought those were candles.

602
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,560
Oh my god.

603
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:49,860
Oh.

604
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,420
Why do the lights keep turning off by themselves?

605
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,260
Okay, look.

606
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,020
There's another tape.

607
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,320
What's that say?

608
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,120
Oh, no.

609
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,640
Addiction.

610
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Oh, addiction.

611
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,420
I think it says abduction.

612
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,800
Abduction.

613
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,800
We're...

614
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,380
Child...

615
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,980
Kidnapper?

616
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,320
Oh!

617
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,520
Um...

618
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,720
Are there...

619
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,500
Meds here?

620
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,240
Are there...

621
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,980
Oh, did that door just close?

622
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm gonna pretend...

623
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,300
Let's just go upstairs and start the story.

624
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,980
But what about my meds?!

625
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,180
You could light that candle.

626
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:21,920
Seriously.

627
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,040
Yeah, but the candle only works if...

628
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,540
I have like...

629
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
Uh...

630
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,260
Like a place to put them on.

631
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Oh.

632
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,200
Like, it doesn't matter unless I have...

633
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,240
I don't understand!

634
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,380
I thought this is a crazy house!

635
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,260
Oh wait, that's where you put the VHS tape.

636
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,340
Yeah.

637
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,680
Okay, let's see.

638
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,700
I'll just keep them.

639
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,260
We have so many.

640
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,820
I'll just hold on to it for now.

641
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,180
It doesn't really matter.

642
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,240
Oh, they can be stored there if you wanna store them.

643
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,580
Yeah, but it's just gonna be in my inventory forever anyway, so does it really matter?

644
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,540
What if you have too many tapes and you find so many medicines all in one?

645
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,560
Oh my god, look how...

646
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,640
Okay, they're not...

647
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,200
Look at my inventory here.

648
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,100
You're gonna find...

649
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,540
You're gonna find...

650
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,360
6, 9, 12...

651
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,140
You're gonna find 20 medicines.

652
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,460
I don't understand.

653
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,120
Why can't I just eat these pills?

654
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,940
It's just sitting there!

655
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,140
Oh, do you think all pills are the same?

656
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,840
Yes.

657
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,980
Alright, start the story.

658
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,000
Start the story!

659
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,740
Don't keep her!

660
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,640
No, no, wait.

661
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,200
Wait a minute.

662
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,040
I can still believe a little bit.

663
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,740
Maybe?

664
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,560
Oh!

665
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,600
Is that some right there?

666
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,320
No, that's not the right pills.

667
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,880
I don't understand.

668
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,780
I can't...

669
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,400
Can't I just have...

670
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,760
Oh, but I thought any pills were good pills.

671
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,400
I have q-tips.

672
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
You can actually examine the q-tips?

673
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,980
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,360
Maybe there's some pills in there.

675
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:35,560
They're called q-creen.

676
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,300
Mister.

677
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,100
Mister.

678
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,620
Mister.

679
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,740
Wow.

680
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,740
I'm starting the...

681
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,180
How's the game volume, everybody?

682
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm starting the hardest chapter with no pills!

683
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,400
I can't do this!

684
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,600
Maybe...

685
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,140
Maybe parrot...

686
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,020
Maybe...

687
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,000
Why do they have all these candles in the world?!

688
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,320
This...

689
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,340
This mom...

690
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,280
Did mom store any in there?

691
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,300
There's gotta be pills in there.

692
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,580
Okay, there's gotta be...

693
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,180
Oh my god.

694
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,660
They must be holding out on me.

695
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,360
There's no way...

696
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,420
You actually sound like an addict right now.

697
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,280
What was that?

698
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,640
Just a stupid doll.

699
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,920
It doesn't matter.

700
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,920
I don't understand.

701
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,180
I...

702
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,960
There's another...

703
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,740
There's another lighter.

704
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
There's so many lighters in the world.

705
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,680
Maybe you don't need pills this chapter.

706
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,220
No, I...

707
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

708
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,840
Oh, there's alcohol though.

709
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,020
Oh, mommy was keeping alcohol in the drawer.

710
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,460
Don't understand.

711
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,620
There's so many.

712
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,540
There's like so many...

713
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh my god.

714
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,520
Those shoes actually freaked me out.

715
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,540
Maybe...

716
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,200
I'll be right back.

717
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,860
I'm gonna go...

718
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,900
No, wait, wait.

719
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,020
I'll be right back.

720
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,800
Where are you going?

721
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,620
Where...

722
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,720
Where are you going?

723
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,020
I'm gonna go get some more water so I can take some medicine.

724
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,760
Oh, okay.

725
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,760
Oh, did your food arrive?

726
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:01,800
Yeah.

727
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,820
Oh, okay.

728
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,180
Nice.

729
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,200
Yeah, so I'm gonna get that and get water and medicine.

730
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,120
I'll be back.

731
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,080
No, I won't be so long.

732
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,180
Okay, bye.

733
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:12,740
Guys...

734
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,240
Oh, oh!

735
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,200
Oh my god, that's my lighter.

736
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,840
Oh!

737
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,780
That's my lighter floating towards me.

738
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,300
Oh my god.

739
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,340
I just had lots of goosebumps from the floating lighter that floated towards me.

740
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,120
Guys...

741
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,320
Where are the other meds?

742
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,420
Guys...

743
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,940
Where are they?

744
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,620
I don't understand.

745
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,020
Shouldn't there be more meds?

746
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,940
I don't understand!

747
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,980
Where are all the meds?

748
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,550
Yeah, but there's so many lighters!

749
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,790
There's so many lighters, yet zero meds.

750
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,290
I...

751
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,630
There's...

752
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,950
There's no way...

753
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,110
There's no way we have a shortage.

754
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,810
There's no way we have a shortage of fucking...

755
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,330
Oh my god.

756
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,510
There's no way.

757
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,730
I refuse to believe we have a shortage.

758
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,970
Why is there still more lighters?!

759
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,490
Everywhere go!

760
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,910
It's a fucking lighter!

761
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,870
I'm just still wielding lighters at this point!

762
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,990
I'm just gonna put this guy over here.

763
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,790
I don't care.

764
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,890
I have so many lighters and candles.

765
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,050
I don't care anymore.

766
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,730
I don't care anymore.

767
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,950
I...

768
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,710
I...

769
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,450
I...

770
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:46,870
I...

771
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,350
There's so many!

772
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,030
I can't...

773
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,090
I'm gonna pause.

774
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,430
I can't...

775
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,310
I found...

776
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,810
I found another lighter!

777
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,750
I found three more lighters!

778
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,510
But yet not a single fucking medication bottle!

779
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,670
I don't...

780
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,690
Well...

781
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:03,990
Um...

782
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,170
Sounds like you just gotta use candles then.

783
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:06,890
Instead of...

784
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,290
Medic...

785
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:07,590
Medic...

786
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,010
Why are you paused?

787
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,470
Come on!

788
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:10,990
Let's go!

789
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,530
Chop chop!

790
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,330
Remember I gotta leave early!

791
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:14,990
Let's go!

792
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,010
I got a burrito.

793
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,870
Can I just give you my save file?

794
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,910
I did not do this for charity!

795
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,270
Oh no!

796
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,550
But you're more of a support!

797
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,150
Note to self, when I...

798
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,080
Whenever I do a charity stream, I'm not putting...

799
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,870
Or this game...

800
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,610
Or...

801
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,750
On the list!

802
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:41,850
Oh!

803
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:42,970
Oh!

804
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,190
Oh!

805
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,210
Oh!

806
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,190
A Dolores chapter!

807
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,590
Yeah!

808
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,170
Where do I go?

809
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,670
Um...

810
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,950
Let me not read the walkthrough I have pulled up.

811
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:58,770
Yeah!

812
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,410
Don't worry!

813
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,290
We're not cheating!

814
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,590
I don't know where to go!

815
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,890
Where do I go?

816
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,450
So we...

817
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,670
So it looks like there's gonna be mirrors we have to break throughout the house.

818
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,490
Oh, come on!

819
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,470
Oh, is it this one?

820
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,310
It has a mirror on it.

821
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,450
Does it?

822
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,050
Oh, maybe.

823
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:19,990
Oh!

824
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:20,670
Eugh!

825
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,180
I don't understand.

826
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:34,910
I...

827
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,090
I don't understand.

828
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:36,710
I think you're in the right spot!

829
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:37,890
There's a key with it.

830
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,330
So we gotta find another key?

831
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,750
Is there another room with a mirror on it?

832
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,490
Hmm...

833
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,850
Oh, there's another room.

834
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,370
Wait, no.

835
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,270
That's the same room.

836
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,790
Oh!

837
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,330
That's literally the same room that I just unlocked.

838
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,250
Oh, yeah.

839
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:54,910
Yeah.

840
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,130
Maybe you can loop the ghost.

841
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,530
I don't understand.

842
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,010
I don't understand.

843
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,150
Um...

844
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:02,850
Sis...

845
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,550
Uh...

846
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,790
So we gotta find a sledgehammer somewhere.

847
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,750
I don't understand.

848
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,710
Did I miss the sledgehammer on here?

849
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,890
Did I just not look down?

850
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,410
I don't understand.

851
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,670
What about the door right behind you?

852
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,790
I don't understand.

853
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,770
It's just...

854
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,030
The door...

855
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,090
The door behind...

856
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,830
Nope, not that one.

857
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,450
Nope, that one right there.

858
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:19,990
That door.

859
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,290
I can't open it.

860
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,030
I can't open it.

861
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,130
I don't understand.

862
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,210
Sledgehammer!

863
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,290
Where is the sledgehammer?

864
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,070
Maybe go try...

865
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,130
Where would a sledgehammer be?

866
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,090
Maybe the garage.

867
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,030
Oh, but...

868
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,750
How do I get to the garage?

869
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,570
Oh, yeah.

870
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,570
It was locked wasn't it?

871
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:40,950
Uh...

872
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,810
Mom...

873
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,610
What's that?

874
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,030
Oh!

875
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,330
Probably need jean pockets.

876
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,510
I don't have jean pockets.

877
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,910
You might.

878
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,810
You have jean pockets.

879
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,110
I...

880
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,190
I don't know.

881
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,030
Uh, go to your...

882
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,930
Go to...

883
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,970
Your closet.

884
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:02,910
What?

885
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,350
That's...

886
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,790
Where are you going?

887
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,090
That's a girl.

888
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,570
That's...

889
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,410
No, I don't think the daughter's gonna have the...

890
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,150
Keys.

891
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,610
The parents' room.

892
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,430
The parents' room!

893
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,230
I'm freaking out.

894
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,370
I'm freaking out.

895
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,490
Stop freaking out!

896
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,530
I'm freaking out.

897
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,090
I'm freaking out.

898
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,810
Stop freaking out!

899
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,390
I don't...

900
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,510
It's fine.

901
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,110
It's fine.

902
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,490
I'm not fine.

903
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,630
Oh, there's no jeans!

904
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,230
Right there!

905
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,050
On the ground.

906
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,050
Jeans.

907
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:25,590
No?

908
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,670
Check the closet.

909
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,670
Check the closet.

910
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,290
But there's nothing going on, Doki!

911
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,470
Nothing happening!

912
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,910
There's nothing here!

913
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,030
Are those cookies in the closet?

914
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,130
I don't know.

915
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,110
Oh, candles.

916
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,390
I'm somehow more useless when I'm sober.

917
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,350
I... I didn't think it was possible.

918
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,510
Okay, give me a sec.

919
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,690
I'll take a drink.

920
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,470
I'll take a drink.

921
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:04,870
Okay.

922
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,410
Yeah.

923
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,230
Yeah.

924
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,030
I definitely... You know, I definitely need... I definitely need a drink.

925
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,150
I hate that.

926
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,280
So what do I do next?

927
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,400
We're looking for the key!

928
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,500
It said... Wait, is that what the note said?

929
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,520
You clicked it so fast, I couldn't even read.

930
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:28,940
I couldn't.

931
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
I was too sober to read.

932
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:36,920
I... I was... I was too... I was too sober to read.

933
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,760
Like, I just saw jeans.

934
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,420
That's all I saw.

935
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,860
I saw jeans.

936
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,900
I don't know what it just says.

937
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,440
It could be in my jeans.

938
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,820
In my jeans?

939
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,080
Well, maybe check your... check your inventory.

940
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,980
Maybe it's been in your pocket this whole time.

941
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,160
Oh, no.

942
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,300
There were no jeans in my inventory.

943
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,480
No, no, no, no, no!

944
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,300
No, no, no, no!

945
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,720
Jeans.

946
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,520
What do I do?

947
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,080
I open two doors!

948
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,800
What do I do?

949
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,560
You keep playing the game.

950
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,980
What do I do?

951
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,040
But where do I go?

952
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,560
Unpause!

953
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,320
I don't go!

954
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,260
We're looking for the keys!

955
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,060
But where's the key?

956
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,820
In the jeans!

957
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,120
But where's the jeans?

958
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,100
We have to look!

959
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,260
Yes, but where do I look?

960
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,340
Check your inventory.

961
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,060
I dare you.

962
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,680
Check your inventory.

963
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,580
Okay, okay, okay.

964
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,480
It's not in my... look, look, look.

965
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,000
It just says...

966
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,260
It's probably in the laundry room!

967
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,300
In the laundry room!

968
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
You literally...

969
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,340
It's one thing we both forgot about, I guess.

970
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,640
Oh my god.

971
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,940
Literally, the answer was right there for you.

972
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,120
Oh, you could light that.

973
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,580
I know.

974
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:50,920
Oops.

975
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,240
This is why you kept eating all your pills and then cried about it.

976
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,580
I wouldn't have cried about it if you gave me better direction.

977
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,140
Turn around.

978
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,620
Turn around.

979
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,060
There you go.

980
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,880
Don't.

981
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,260
Turn around.

982
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,760
Turn around.

983
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,360
Turn around.

984
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,140
Wait, is that the laundry room?

985
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,520
No, it's not in the closet!

986
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,700
What is it?

987
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,300
Towards the TV!

988
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,500
Go towards the TV.

989
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,280
We were just there!

990
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,000
This is the laundry room.

991
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,800
Yes.

992
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,280
No, that's the fridge.

993
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,800
Oh, wait.

994
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,100
I thought this was the laundry room.

995
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,560
No, it's not.

996
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,560
Oh, now I don't know.

997
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,860
Oh my god.

998
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,920
You don't even know where it is.

999
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,020
Nah, I don't know.

1000
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,520
Is this it?

1001
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,180
No.

1002
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,680
Is this the laundry room?

1003
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,100
No.

1004
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,400
No.

1005
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,060
Oh, now that's the bathroom...

1006
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,280
Oh...

1007
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,740
Oh, that's the toilet.

1008
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,860
Oh no, that's the bathroom.

1009
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,360
Where is the...

1010
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,040
Where is the?

1011
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,300
Where is the...

1012
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,980
Where do people do laundry?

1013
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,240
Laundry.

1014
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,840
Where people do laundry.

1015
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,200
No, this is the garage.

1016
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,220
Where people do laundry.

1017
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,920
Laundry, where?

1018
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,920
Why are you saying it like that?

1019
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,540
Where is the laundry room?

1020
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,020
I thought it was that one room.

1021
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,200
Oh, it's next to the kitchen.

1022
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:21,740
Oh.

1023
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,160
It's not downstairs.

1024
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,780
It's not downstairs.

1025
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,540
Wait a minute.

1026
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,200
I guess not.

1027
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,560
There you go.

1028
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,000
Next to the kitchen.

1029
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,400
This is kitchen.

1030
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
This is kitchen.

1031
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,260
This is kitchen.

1032
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:43,780
Kitchen.

1033
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,520
Oh, no.

1034
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,420
This is the dining room.

1035
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
Then the kitchen is here.

1036
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,300
Kitchen here.

1037
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,600
And then laundry room is probably over here.

1038
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,380
What?

1039
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,240
Yeah.

1040
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,020
Yeah.

1041
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,220
Yippee!

1042
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,440
Okay.

1043
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,860
And your jeans.

1044
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,720
My jeans.

1045
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,660
Any jeans?

1046
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,080
Where's the jeans?

1047
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:04,720
My jeans.

1048
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,580
You got all the recessive jeans.

1049
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,020
Jeans where?

1050
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,160
Check inside.

1051
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,660
Oh, it's in the dryer.

1052
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,620
Oh, fuck.

1053
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,060
The elderly are really scary.

1054
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,780
What if she's hiding in there?

1055
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,620
She's like, I can't wait for Dolores to say her famous thing.

1056
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,920
She's like, hello, sweetie.

1057
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,680
I'm going to Dolores you.

1058
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,220
I'm just like, you want a little crackery?

1059
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,620
I want a little crackery.

1060
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,440
Garage.

1061
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,760
Do you want a little... Wait, how...

1062
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,920
What did I get pills?

1063
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,960
What did I...

1064
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,680
How did these pills get in my head?

1065
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,900
Toki, I told you.

1066
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,260
You had them this whole time.

1067
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,560
You have a problem, Toki.

1068
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,640
I don't even know when these pills showed up in my head.

1069
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,620
It just like appeared out of nowhere.

1070
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,420
Well, put them in your inventory before you accidentally eat them.

1071
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,280
Okay, right.

1072
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:09,980
You're right.

1073
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,320
That's so true.

1074
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,960
That's so true.

1075
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,580
As she doesn't do that.

1076
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,940
Whoops, I...

1077
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,280
Okay, there we go.

1078
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,240
My dual wielding lighters.

1079
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,380
Wait, did you just throw them away?

1080
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,080
No, I put them in the...

1081
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,120
Wait.

1082
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,300
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1083
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,340
Oop.

1084
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,400
Why doesn't it work?

1085
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,300
It's because it's not broken.

1086
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,360
Why is it not around?

1087
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:39,860
Yeah.

1088
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,200
Hello?

1089
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,100
Maybe it's inside.

1090
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,300
Oh.

1091
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,460
Oh, see ya.

1092
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,260
Okay.

1093
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,180
Alright, find a sledgehammer.

1094
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,840
Is this a sledgehammer?

1095
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,080
Looks like it.

1096
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,940
Oh, there...

1097
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,540
No, that's a rake.

1098
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,380
Nope, that's a rake.

1099
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,420
Is that a sledgehammer?

1100
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,120
Is this a butterfly?

1101
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,720
I'm here to do butterfly.

1102
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,870
I think the colors in the sky.

1103
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:32,830
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

1104
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,390
Okay, then, lock that.

1105
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,590
Where's the, where's the hammer?

1106
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,490
What if Dolores comes over and just starts hitting me?

1107
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,450
Wait, oh, it says it's inside the car.

1108
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,270
But... In the car?

1109
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,150
Something's not right.

1110
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,590
My walkthrough is wrong.

1111
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,290
It's different.

1112
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,810
There's nothing in here.

1113
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,120
There's nothing in here.

1114
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,120
Oh!

1115
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,660
Like I said... Oh, God!

1116
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,700
Okay, maybe it's upstairs.

1117
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,880
Oh, my... walkthrough is wrong.

1118
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,880
I have no idea now.

1119
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,140
Everything is different.

1120
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,720
I'm completely lost.

1121
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,840
Look at my... my... my six lighter.

1122
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,660
It says... Oh, garage room.

1123
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,660
Where does this go?

1124
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,640
Oh, it goes here.

1125
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,300
Wait, what?

1126
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,320
Why is... why are there so many ways to get to the garage?

1127
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,560
Oh, hi.

1128
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,320
Yeah.

1129
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,140
Uh... Oh, it says you didn't start the chapter.

1130
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,560
I did.

1131
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:42,820
But we did.

1132
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,560
Yeah, we did.

1133
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,240
I picked up the key with the mirror.

1134
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,020
I picked it up.

1135
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,060
Maybe we have to find the mirror first.

1136
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,720
Maybe... go back to the room with the mirrors.

1137
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,520
But I went through there.

1138
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,580
There was nothing there.

1139
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,600
It just looped me.

1140
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,340
They were just like, surprised.

1141
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
And I was like, hello.

1142
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,400
Hello, good sir.

1143
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,640
Let's see.

1144
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:05,860
Let's see.

1145
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,400
It's this one.

1146
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,100
Look.

1147
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
We have to go find a mirror.

1148
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,080
Hold on.

1149
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,600
Let's go in.

1150
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,180
Is there like anything that we can... It's jammed.

1151
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Can we...

1152
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,220
Can we take off the thing off the mirror?

1153
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,460
Oh, yeah.

1154
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,720
See, there's a sound coming from it.

1155
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,420
Oh.

1156
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,860
Hello.

1157
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,060
Hello.

1158
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,260
Hello?

1159
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:25,780
Okay.

1160
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,720
Okay.

1161
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,880
Now we think we can go.

1162
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,640
Mirror, mirror.

1163
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,280
What's that sound?

1164
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,860
Oh, it's saved.

1165
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,580
Oh, I started the chapter.

1166
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,400
Oh, wow.

1167
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,380
Oh, wow.

1168
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,080
Whoa.

1169
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,860
Who would've thunk?

1170
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,220
We didn't do the thing.

1171
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
I know.

1172
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,540
We didn't do the thing.

1173
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,040
Hello.

1174
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,100
I don't know if you want to keep taking these off.

1175
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Oh.

1176
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,340
Hello?

1177
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,920
Hello?

1178
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:51,640
What's going on?

1179
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,220
What's going on over there?

1180
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,300
Hello?

1181
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,360
Hello?

1182
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,320
Hello?

1183
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,140
Hello?

1184
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,180
Knock, knock.

1185
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,360
Oh, my God.

1186
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,100
Are you going to die here?

1187
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,900
Oh, it's another mirror.

1188
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,340
Oh.

1189
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,980
That's another mirror.

1190
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,880
Oh, the mirror seems to show a room in the house.

1191
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,660
Where's... Where's that?

1192
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Where is that?

1193
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,560
I don't know.

1194
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,020
I'm going to use the bathroom.

1195
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,460
Oh, my God.

1196
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,780
We just started.

1197
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,600
We just started.

1198
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,100
There she goes.

1199
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,480
Okay.

1200
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,380
Oh, wow.

1201
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:31,860
Wow.

1202
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,520
This feels like Mint is playing critically acclaimed lit game Lifeline.

1203
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,000
But Doki is less responsive real.

1204
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,020
I... I... I got up... I got a...

1205
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,960
A walkthrough because...

1206
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,200
I want to try and finish the chapter today, but I don't think that's happening.

1207
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,180
She's just making it harder on herself, no?

1208
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,280
Because if she doesn't finish the chapter today, she's going to have to keep doing it.

1209
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,020
She's going to have to play it again.

1210
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,820
My burrito is okay.

1211
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,680
I just... I wanted a trash burrito.

1212
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,600
So I got Taco Bell because I don't...

1213
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,900
You guys, sorry if I'm a little...

1214
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,000
If I'm a little...

1215
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,600
I don't feel very well right now.

1216
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,420
I'm eating so that I can take some pain in my bishops.

1217
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,020
Tell us what kind of burrito.

1218
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,060
It's a five layer burrito from Taco Bell.

1219
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,520
Okay.

1220
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,900
I'm sorry.

1221
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm sorry.

1222
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,720
I'm sorry.

1223
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,040
Oh, hi.

1224
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,080
Okay.

1225
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,440
Okay.

1226
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,160
I'm okay now.

1227
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,760
I'm okay.

1228
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm okay.

1229
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,460
I'm okay.

1230
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:36,700
I'm okay.

1231
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,580
I'm...

1232
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:45,920
I don't know.

1233
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,520
We went around the whole house.

1234
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,820
I mean, to be right around the whole house without starting the chapter.

1235
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,380
But don't we have to get the sledgehammer?

1236
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,780
Do we have to?

1237
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,120
Oh, wait.

1238
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,740
After...

1239
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,080
So, yeah.

1240
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,720
We do have to go get the sledgehammer.

1241
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,080
Because it says the first mirror will be found on the second floor near the sun's room.

1242
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,480
Oh, okay.

1243
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,400
And then...

1244
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,180
Okay, now we can go to the garage.

1245
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,540
I think now.

1246
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,860
Oh.

1247
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,360
Ew.

1248
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,320
Why is our roof so dusty, crusty?

1249
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,460
Doki Bird is taking her first breaths as a baby.

1250
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,940
Oh, maybe not.

1251
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
There's supposed to be a car alarm going off.

1252
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,840
Okay, I think we gotta go find that room.

1253
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,520
I mean, the attic's up here, right?

1254
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:35,920
Oh.

1255
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,520
Is...

1256
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:36,740
No.

1257
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,400
I don't know, actually.

1258
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,200
We need to find the room first.

1259
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:42,580
Okay.

1260
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,620
Maybe here.

1261
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:44,980
Where...

1262
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,700
Was a rocking chair?

1263
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,240
I don't remember any chair that was rocking.

1264
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,740
There isn't a pier.

1265
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,200
There's...

1266
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,720
Where would it be rocking?

1267
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,580
Maybe I could look up and there'd be an attic above me?

1268
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,680
I don't think you go to the attic yet.

1269
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,020
I think we need to find the rocking chair.

1270
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,620
Yeah.

1271
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,020
Yeah, but we're rocking chair.

1272
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,620
Where would things start rocking?

1273
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,060
Grandma's room?

1274
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,820
Where the hell is grandma's room?

1275
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,220
Grandma has her own special little room.

1276
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:18,500
Oh, wait.

1277
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,500
Is that it?

1278
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,400
Rocking?

1279
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:21,700
Oh!

1280
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,320
Turn around!

1281
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:22,620
Turn around!

1282
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:22,740
Come on.

1283
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,660
I hear it.

1284
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,340
Where are you going?

1285
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:29,860
Go...

1286
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,320
Turn around!

1287
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,220
Go back in that room!

1288
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,140
I don't wanna go back.

1289
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:35,260
I can.

1290
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,180
Go back in there!

1291
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,720
I don't wanna go back.

1292
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,880
Take another drink and then go back in there.

1293
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:45,780
I just...

1294
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,820
I don't wanna go back.

1295
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,640
Now, where are you going?

1296
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,480
I don't know where to go.

1297
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,300
You go into that room!

1298
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,280
Oh my god!

1299
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,680
Now... Check that door.

1300
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,180
It's jammed.

1301
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,020
It's jammed.

1302
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,460
I hear it though.

1303
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,920
Don't you guys... Maybe go upstairs.

1304
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,620
Try upstairs.

1305
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,920
It's in the parents room maybe.

1306
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,860
Why are you looking at... I don't know.

1307
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,180
There's an attic maybe?

1308
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,480
Just follow the sounds.

1309
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,040
You hear it creaking, right?

1310
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,500
I do, but I'm pretending I don't.

1311
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,320
Well, that's gonna make this game a lot longer.

1312
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,720
That's the attic.

1313
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,760
Yeah, but I don't think we're going there yet.

1314
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,000
How do we... No, it says it's out of reach.

1315
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,600
Oh.

1316
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,020
Oh, you got another one of those freaky dolls.

1317
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,900
The lights in my room just flickered.

1318
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,740
Just follow him.

1319
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,720
He's telling you where to go!

1320
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,640
Is he a good man?

1321
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,400
Wait,

1322
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:16,860
what?

1323
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,100
That's a candle room.

1324
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,060
Where candle spot.

1325
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,260
Where did I fall?

1326
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,660
Where did you put your candle at?

1327
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,820
In detail.

1328
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,540
Where did he go?

1329
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,540
I don't think he went down here.

1330
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,640
I think he went down the hallway.

1331
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,220
Vroom?

1332
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:43,540
No.

1333
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,120
No vroom?

1334
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,720
No, I think you gotta go follow him.

1335
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,260
Where did he go?

1336
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,320
I think he turned to the right.

1337
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,600
I went down there.

1338
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,800
Hello, sir?

1339
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,220
Oh, there he is.

1340
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,580
Sir, where are you?

1341
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,020
I'm gonna go follow that way.

1342
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,460
Where are you going?

1343
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,420
Keep following him.

1344
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,260
Maybe.

1345
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,640
What was that sound?

1346
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,400
Oh, the lights don't work.

1347
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Oh, the lights not working.

1348
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,840
You can fix it, right?

1349
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,940
Oh, look at that.

1350
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,220
What is that?

1351
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,880
Yoink.

1352
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,080
Is that the husband?

1353
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,560
That's grandpa.

1354
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,720
I told you the elderly is scary.

1355
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,120
Hey, what's this for?

1356
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,140
Did you ever see that movie about the...

1357
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,740
The what?

1358
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,420
The kids that went to their grandparents' house and then the grandma was naked and climbing under around the house?

1359
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:46,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1360
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,800
Because it was by M.

1361
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,400
Night Shyamalan.

1362
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,000
Was it?

1363
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Yeah, it was about how like the...

1364
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,480
The...

1365
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:53,940
Where am I?

1366
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,100
It was about...

1367
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,580
It was about...

1368
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,480
Wait, I should save.

1369
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,580
It was about like, um...

1370
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,460
These kids try to visit their grandparents and then like they haven't seen...

1371
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,520
The kids haven't seen their grandparents in a long time since they were children or whatever.

1372
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,420
So they didn't know how they actually looked like.

1373
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:19,720
And then it like the 2 grandparents were actually like, from the insane asylum or something.

1374
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1375
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,900
And then, like, they ate the grandparents or killed... I don't know, they ate the original grandparents or killed them?

1376
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,020
They ate them?

1377
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,960
Wait, why is it going back up?

1378
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,240
Am I banished?

1379
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,080
Why does it sound like it's moaning?

1380
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,700
Just, I think, walk.

1381
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:48,340
Oh, it's because, like, the parents didn't know because, like, the dad's not in the picture anymore.

1382
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,660
And then the mom was like, go see your mommy and daddy.

1383
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,640
And then the mom was like, oh, hey, there's my rocking chair.

1384
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,960
I don't like that.

1385
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,180
Oh, try going through.

1386
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,640
Oh, oh, hey, things are nicer now.

1387
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,720
That's cool.

1388
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,460
Oh, things are not nicer now.

1389
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,520
What is that?

1390
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,040
What is that?

1391
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,100
That's a ghost.

1392
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,020
That's a ghost.

1393
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,700
It's like a ghost.

1394
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,080
It's like a ghost.

1395
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,420
A good, good, good.

1396
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,000
Pieces.

1397
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,180
Oh, the baby's missing.

1398
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,840
No, I think it's the little dangly thing.

1399
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:27,240
Oh.

1400
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,940
Oh, the baby's missing.

1401
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,260
Oh.

1402
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,860
Oh, I think the baby's also missing.

1403
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,160
Hello?

1404
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,780
I used... and even though it can be stored in the absorb...

1405
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,140
...to find those storage spaces.

1406
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:49,560
Okay.

1407
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,400
So maybe you don't need meds.

1408
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:52,840
Oh.

1409
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,980
I don't know about that.

1410
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,040
What?

1411
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,300
Oh, oh.

1412
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,680
There's so many.

1413
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,160
It's become very hard to pinpoint the exact disorder.

1414
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,820
They tell me she's got symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder...

1415
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,740
Y'all have schizophrenia.

1416
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,040
Wow.

1417
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,500
She got a lot of things wrong with her.

1418
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,200
Yeah.

1419
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,340
Oh, she's crying.

1420
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,900
I think you should seek a second opinion.

1421
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,140
I know, you're right.

1422
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,560
They just tell people they have schizophrenia...

1423
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,400
...because they just don't want to deal with them.

1424
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,540
It's like hysteria, remember?

1425
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,540
Schizophrenia is just like when they told women they were hysterical.

1426
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,280
It's not real.

1427
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,400
Those voices just tell me...

1428
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,920
Everyone has voices in their heads.

1429
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,180
Yeah, everybody does.

1430
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,260
Yeah, see?

1431
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,140
Sometimes you have multiple voices.

1432
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,380
I've never...

1433
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,780
I'm not even here.

1434
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,040
I've never been here.

1435
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,180
Okay.

1436
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,400
Yeah, the more the merrier.

1437
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,060
The more voices you hear.

1438
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,880
The more friends you have.

1439
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,380
Yeah, who's mint?

1440
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,040
Oh.

1441
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,260
What do I...

1442
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,700
What do I...

1443
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,000
Um, what do you do?

1444
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,700
It's a music box symbol.

1445
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,520
It's locked.

1446
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,600
What do I...

1447
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,440
Um...

1448
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,400
I'm stuck here.

1449
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,220
What, is it really that bad to be stuck here?

1450
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,280
Oh, does that have a code or anything?

1451
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:29,980
I don't know.

1452
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,200
Um...

1453
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,260
There's more code.

1454
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,420
Five.

1455
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,280
There's more.

1456
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:39,720
Three.

1457
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,020
And then there's more...

1458
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,500
What do the numbers say, mint?

1459
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,700
They're the lotto numbers.

1460
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:43,960
What do they say?

1461
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,200
Actually, that's what my grandma did.

1462
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,480
She had binders and binders and binders full of lotto numbers.

1463
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,400
Because she thought she could predict what the next lotto number would be.

1464
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,560
Did she win?

1465
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,840
Do you think my grandma...

1466
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,500
Do you think my grandma ever won the lottery?

1467
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,800
Maybe she, like, buried it.

1468
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,640
One day you're gonna find a note.

1469
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,920
You're gonna find a note that she had the lotto numbers.

1470
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:10,880
Mint.

1471
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,480
Only you understood.

1472
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,080
Use the numbers.

1473
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,740
Use the numbers.

1474
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,460
In 20 years, you're gonna find a piece of paper.

1475
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,480
That will lead you to the numbers.

1476
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,560
The one piece.

1477
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,120
The numbers.

1478
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,060
What do they mean?

1479
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,880
Oh, wait.

1480
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,520
I have...

1481
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:33,740
What do they mean?

1482
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,300
What the...

1483
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:35,680
Oh.

1484
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,040
Wait, what?

1485
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
I don't like that.

1486
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,520
Oh, like the full...

1487
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,340
I really don't like that.

1488
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,800
Who is that?

1489
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,600
I don't know.

1490
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,700
But there are a bunch of paintings.

1491
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,760
Did you look through the whole thing?

1492
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,080
Did you look to the left?

1493
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:50,540
Yeah.

1494
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:51,300
Yeah.

1495
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:51,900
Yeah.

1496
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,520
Yeah.

1497
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:52,940
Okay.

1498
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,680
I did.

1499
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,860
Okay.

1500
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,720
Yeah.

1501
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:56,740
Yeah.

1502
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,760
I did.

1503
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,020
Oh, what are there?

1504
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:00,800
Oh.

1505
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,740
Hello.

1506
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,060
Hello.

1507
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:03,840
Hello.

1508
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:08,850
Okay.

1509
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,230
Are there more?

1510
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,350
What do the numbers mean?

1511
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,690
You have two holes for each of your eyes.

1512
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:18,830
So you can look at once.

1513
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:19,310
Whoa.

1514
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,020
Any others?

1515
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,160
No, those are all the holes.

1516
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,920
If there's a hole...

1517
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,160
Two holes.

1518
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,820
It looks like something is missing.

1519
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:32,840
A shoe?

1520
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,060
Oh.

1521
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:35,720
Oh, yeah.

1522
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,460
The other shoe.

1523
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,580
The other shoe.

1524
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,920
I'm going to dress up like her.

1525
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,080
Oh, my God.

1526
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,320
Granny's little outfit.

1527
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,640
What'd you do?

1528
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,540
I'm going to dress up like her.

1529
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,700
You were so ugly.

1530
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,540
You broke the mirror.

1531
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,580
They hated the outfit.

1532
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:56,500
Wait.

1533
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,240
Granny's outfit is gone.

1534
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,420
Wait.

1535
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,240
The door is open.

1536
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,420
The door is open.

1537
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,440
The door is open.

1538
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,320
All right.

1539
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,040
Keep going, baby.

1540
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,280
I thought you said you liked this house.

1541
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,760
I don't like this house no more.

1542
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,440
Oh.

1543
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,360
Did you see that?

1544
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,220
Yeah.

1545
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,200
Is that her?

1546
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,460
Oh, it won't light up.

1547
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,740
Is she down there?

1548
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,280
Granny.

1549
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:21,820
Grandma.

1550
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,420
Oh.

1551
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,220
I think that's her.

1552
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,680
Grandma.

1553
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,940
Granny.

1554
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,780
Grandma.

1555
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,200
What do the numbers mean, Grandma?

1556
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:33,920
Granny.

1557
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,060
Oh, she's right behind.

1558
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,000
I said look behind.

1559
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:39,580
Oh.

1560
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,240
Hello?

1561
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,940
You're kind of crazy.

1562
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,140
Stand in the light for a second.

1563
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,060
I got the pills.

1564
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,760
Or I take the pills.

1565
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,120
Who knows?

1566
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:51,780
Who cares?

1567
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,320
Whatever.

1568
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:52,980
Okay.

1569
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,820
I got the pills.

1570
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:54,880
All right.

1571
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,560
So that's one.

1572
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:55,660
Okay.

1573
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,060
So Granny is now going to kill me.

1574
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,320
Potentially.

1575
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,300
Oh, look.

1576
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,120
There's the blood trail.

1577
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:03,900
Oh, no.

1578
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,280
Oh, no.

1579
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,380
Oh.

1580
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:08,780
All right.

1581
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,420
That's not radical at all.

1582
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,260
Keep...

1583
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:13,400
Yep.

1584
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,060
Follow up.

1585
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,780
Follow that.

1586
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,380
Follow it.

1587
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,100
That's not cool.

1588
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,500
I don't think that's cool, Granny.

1589
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,620
I think it is pretty radical in a literal sense.

1590
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,240
I don't think it is.

1591
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,200
Well, your Granny brings a pool of oil.

1592
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,820
Whoa.

1593
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,080
Is it?

1594
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,120
Is it like an intestine?

1595
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,520
Yes, it is.

1596
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,000
Whoa.

1597
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,800
That's not cool no more, Granny.

1598
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,880
That's not cool, Granny.

1599
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,120
Oh, you're going to go in there.

1600
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:48,460
Don't you hate it when your Granny gift leads you to the trail of blood into a long intestine?

1601
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,260
We're going back into the womb.

1602
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,520
Oh, no.

1603
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,060
Oh, this is what it looks like.

1604
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,760
I remember.

1605
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,520
Oh, yeah?

1606
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1607
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,640
Yeah, I think your mom took too much...

1608
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:01,980
Oh, wait.

1609
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,860
That's the tar, man.

1610
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,800
Yeah.

1611
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,220
I think your mom took too much...

1612
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,060
Too much zinc.

1613
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,680
Zinc.

1614
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,540
Wait, where you are?

1615
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,840
Wait, what?

1616
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,540
I don't know.

1617
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,000
Look around.

1618
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,320
I'm looking.

1619
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,200
Keep looking.

1620
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,600
Look where the tar, man, went.

1621
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,380
What here?

1622
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,080
Turn on the light.

1623
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,260
Oh, that is...

1624
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:27,380
Oh.

1625
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,600
Oh.

1626
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,300
Oh, you have to crouch.

1627
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,360
The gamers don't look down.

1628
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,040
Yeah, yeah.

1629
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,900
You didn't look down, either.

1630
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,760
I'm not playing the game.

1631
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:41,340
Hello.

1632
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,620
Zinc, does that to you?

1633
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,820
I don't think so.

1634
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,740
You don't know that.

1635
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,540
You don't remember what it was like in the womb.

1636
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,600
Hello.

1637
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,140
There's the mirror.

1638
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,080
There's the mirrors.

1639
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,200
Happy things happen in the mirror, right?

1640
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,740
That's a lot of mirrors.

1641
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,800
Do we have to break all of these?

1642
00:56:59,880 --> 00:56:59,920
Yeah.

1643
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,880
I don't think I can.

1644
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,040
Oh, hello.

1645
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,440
Grandma.

1646
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,660
G-Ma.

1647
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,500
Happy things happen in the mirror.

1648
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,900
Look, granny wants to see me.

1649
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,480
Hello?

1650
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,660
They say that the mirror is a portal to another world.

1651
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,220
The spiritual world.

1652
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:19,600
Oh, I see her.

1653
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,580
There she is.

1654
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,080
Oh, she ripped her hair out.

1655
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,860
Do you see that?

1656
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,900
Uh, uh...

1657
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,180
Yeah.

1658
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:26,600
Yeah.

1659
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,700
She was a little...

1660
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:27,780
I kind of.

1661
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,560
Wait.

1662
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,560
So, like, your portal leads to other grannies?

1663
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,920
Oh, my.

1664
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,260
I think she's gonna jump at you.

1665
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,980
I know.

1666
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,640
I know she is.

1667
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,700
But it's okay.

1668
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:41,860
But it's okay.

1669
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,820
It's okay.

1670
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:44,620
Oh.

1671
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:45,740
Oh.

1672
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,380
YouTube, don't look.

1673
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,980
It's not what you think.

1674
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,760
Maybe she's getting raptured.

1675
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,100
Maybe she's getting raptured.

1676
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,080
And it stopped midway.

1677
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,260
The rapture is buffering.

1678
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1679
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,780
They had to download.

1680
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,540
Download more.

1681
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,880
Downloading more RAM.

1682
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,380
Is she looking at you?

1683
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,140
Yeah.

1684
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,480
What do you do here?

1685
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,000
Is there anything around, like, behind you?

1686
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,200
I think you just keep looking until something...

1687
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,900
Until she gets closer and closer.

1688
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,520
And then she goes, ooga-booga-booga.

1689
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,880
Icky-booga-booga!

1690
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,980
Come on, granny.

1691
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,620
It's ooga-booga time.

1692
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,160
Hello?

1693
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,020
Oh.

1694
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,200
Did she get closer?

1695
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:42,580
There she is again.

1696
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,500
Uh, no.

1697
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,200
She looks about the same.

1698
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,420
She looks like Groot from here.

1699
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,160
Okay.

1700
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,760
Turn around.

1701
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,900
Oh, she wanted me to turn around.

1702
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,440
Ah!

1703
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,840
I actually...

1704
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,260
I actually backed up.

1705
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,520
Me too!

1706
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,300
Me too!

1707
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,440
Me too!

1708
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,580
Oh, my...

1709
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,840
Oh, I don't want to go into that room.

1710
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,520
I feel more safe up here.

1711
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:19,820
Really?

1712
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,920
I think you should go in.

1713
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,860
Oh, fuck.

1714
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,880
I need to breathe out.

1715
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,620
After that.

1716
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,280
I need to breathe out.

1717
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,300
Oh, my God.

1718
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,320
I think granny level is the worst one.

1719
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,360
What?

1720
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,840
It's because...

1721
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,240
It's because they're old.

1722
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,600
Oh.

1723
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,880
Old people are kind of freaky.

1724
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,400
Yeah.

1725
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,360
They have nothing to lose.

1726
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,000
Exactly.

1727
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,260
They're more likely to run at you naked.

1728
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1729
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,700
They're, like, more comfortable in their own skin, too.

1730
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,320
It's also just freaky, like...

1731
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,080
I don't know.

1732
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,880
Like, I think they're creepier than children.

1733
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,060
They're, like...

1734
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,080
Who's breathing?

1735
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:05,380
Might want to follow.

1736
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,980
Don't make those sounds.

1737
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:12,720
Don't keep birds.

1738
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,300
Wait, the door is unjammed.

1739
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,720
Wait, is that another mirror?

1740
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,640
We have to break right there.

1741
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:25,580
Oh.

1742
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,080
Oh.

1743
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,960
Now you can go get the...

1744
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,160
Now go to the garage.

1745
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,640
No, but this door opened.

1746
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,380
Yeah, but go to the garage because we gotta get the...

1747
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:33,700
Oh, look.

1748
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,460
Look at the door.

1749
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,180
Over there.

1750
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,300
Yeah.

1751
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,180
It looks like the loading screen.

1752
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,840
Oh, it does.

1753
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,260
Don't clip that audio, everybody.

1754
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:46,900
What?

1755
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,200
Don't take advantage of her.

1756
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,100
I'm in a vulnerable place right now.

1757
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,180
She's in a vulnerable place right now.

1758
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,040
I'm so vulnerable.

1759
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,080
Do I go downstairs?

1760
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,400
Do I get my hat?

1761
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,160
Yeah, go to the garage.

1762
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,000
Now we're gonna get the sledgehammer.

1763
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,640
You'll feel safer with that.

1764
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,040
See, see.

1765
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:13,700
I got it.

1766
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,020
I could go...

1767
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:18,340
I could go smashy, smashy.

1768
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,520
I know.

1769
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,580
There's new around here.

1770
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,460
Oh, you're talking about that kind of smash.

1771
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,360
Smashy, smashy.

1772
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,240
Smash or pass.

1773
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,880
Grandma edition.

1774
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,060
Grandma edition.

1775
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,840
Would you smash that grandma?

1776
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:46,300
I mean, she must have a lot of experience if you think about it.

1777
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,200
Again, old people don't have anything to lose.

1778
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,280
That's why there's more STDs in retirement homes.

1779
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,640
You love that fact.

1780
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,920
You bring up that fact whenever you can.

1781
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,960
No, it's not true.

1782
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,840
It just...

1783
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,800
It was my segue.

1784
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,380
It was a good segue.

1785
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,800
Hey, any car people.

1786
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,800
What kind of car is this?

1787
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,980
If you have...

1788
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,940
If you have a granny in a retirement home, you know she's getting some right now.

1789
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,380
Can you turn off the alarm or...

1790
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,260
No, we'll just leave there for comfort.

1791
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,260
Oh, wait.

1792
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,460
My inventory is full?

1793
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,960
No, they can't do that to me.

1794
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,900
I told you.

1795
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,420
They can't do that to me.

1796
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,820
I told you this day would happen.

1797
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,500
They can't.

1798
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:32,880
No.

1799
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,080
No, they can't.

1800
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,640
They can't.

1801
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,060
They can't just...

1802
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,900
Do you need all three lighters?

1803
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,960
Yes, yes, I do.

1804
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,420
Wait, no.

1805
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,220
No.

1806
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,640
Oh, I don't need the camera.

1807
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,420
I don't keep the camera.

1808
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,360
What if it's not...

1809
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,160
What if it's like dark?

1810
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,920
Why can't you store those things?

1811
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,000
Oh.

1812
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,420
Um...

1813
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,440
Wait, how do I...

1814
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,220
What do I do?

1815
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,360
I think Dolores is coming.

1816
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,560
Don't say that.

1817
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,560
Don't say that.

1818
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,020
I'm trying to drop this item, but I can't drop it.

1819
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,280
I can't drop it.

1820
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,180
Why can't I drop it?

1821
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:14,980
I don't understand.

1822
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,060
I...

1823
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,220
Okay, I drop this.

1824
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,200
And then...

1825
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:19,540
Okay.

1826
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,000
I put this in.

1827
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,700
And then...

1828
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,720
I put this away.

1829
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,520
And then...

1830
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:26,820
I put this in.

1831
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,220
Can we do this not here?

1832
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:28,720
No.

1833
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:34,920
There you go.

1834
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:39,880
Um...

1835
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,700
There you go.

1836
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,520
I got it.

1837
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,700
It's my comfort sound.

1838
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,240
It's my comfort sound.

1839
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,000
My grandmother lived in the villages for 10 years.

1840
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,820
STD capital of the country.

1841
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,280
Hey, she had a good time.

1842
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:02,840
The villages.

1843
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,300
Whoa!

1844
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,220
And now I have the lighter.

1845
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:09,400
Who's that?

1846
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,920
Who was that?

1847
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,420
Who went...

1848
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,300
It was like a cow.

1849
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,700
Grandma's a heifer.

1850
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,260
Rawr.

1851
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,280
Hello?

1852
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,560
Hello?

1853
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:26,980
Hello?

1854
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,260
Hello?

1855
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,900
Why can't I...

1856
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,280
Hello?

1857
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,760
I can still hear the car.

1858
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,040
Why'd you leave that?

1859
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,880
Because I can't put my...

1860
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,080
It won't let me hold my lighter.

1861
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,060
You're holding it right now.

1862
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,200
I can't store this.

1863
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,220
Okay, remember this.

1864
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,800
Oh, this looks like it's important.

1865
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,360
Remember this, guys.

1866
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,200
Screenshot it.

1867
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,760
Stop the camera.

1868
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,840
Stop the camera.

1869
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:54,040
Stop.

1870
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:54,960
12.30.

1871
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,540
1.45.

1872
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,600
And what's the last one?

1873
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,340
What's the last one?

1874
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,720
Here you go.

1875
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,740
Remember this.

1876
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,280
8.20.

1877
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:03,820
Okay.

1878
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,000
Why can't I?

1879
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:05,860
Why can't I?

1880
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,240
I need the lighter.

1881
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,440
I'll be back for it.

1882
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,080
Oh.

1883
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:14,680
Okay.

1884
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:17,900
Yup.

1885
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:18,540
Alright.

1886
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,020
Did you remember it?

1887
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,680
Yeah, probably.

1888
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:26,510
Oh.

1889
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,530
Can you actually turn off the alarm?

1890
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:30,610
I don't know.

1891
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,190
I'm leaving it there for my comfort.

1892
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:33,350
Okay.

1893
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:36,130
It's like my happy place.

1894
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,390
Isn't there a mirror here?

1895
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:40,870
Doki is psychotic.

1896
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,430
Right?

1897
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,210
I think it's gone.

1898
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,350
Remember we touched it?

1899
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:45,130
No.

1900
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:45,850
No.

1901
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:48,190
No.

1902
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:50,470
Just find another mirror.

1903
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:51,430
No.

1904
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:53,590
Could be one of somewhere.

1905
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,270
Right there!

1906
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:05,660
Why is the inventory in this such ass?

1907
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,220
I know.

1908
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,220
I'm so confused.

1909
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,160
It's so hard to...

1910
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:09,660
Use.

1911
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:12,740
Alright.

1912
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,800
Is that your best cat?

1913
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,180
Oh, wait.

1914
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:24,560
What?

1915
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,100
What is this?

1916
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,760
Oh, what'd you...

1917
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,360
Why'd you grab that?

1918
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:27,960
I don't know.

1919
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,440
I don't know what's going on.

1920
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:31,940
Like...

1921
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:32,880
I don't understand.

1922
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,300
Why can't I just hold this?

1923
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,020
And then...

1924
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:35,380
I know!

1925
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,480
Oh, I can't even light it up.

1926
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,800
I can still hear the car!

1927
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,360
Oh.

1928
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:48,880
What is going on?

1929
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,360
Look up!

1930
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,400
Oh, it's just leaves.

1931
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,820
Okay, we gotta do a puzzle.

1932
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,760
Wait, but how do I know which painting goes for what?

1933
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:07,720
Yeah.

1934
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,160
Maybe they just need to match.

1935
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,800
But what matches what?

1936
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:15,520
Oh, wait.

1937
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,420
See, there's some here too.

1938
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,160
Oh, there's...

1939
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:17,500
No, wait.

1940
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,100
There's something above me.

1941
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,620
How do I get there?

1942
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,840
Maybe once you solve the puzzle.

1943
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,620
Oh, but how do I get there?

1944
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,880
Um, by solving the puzzle.

1945
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,080
But...

1946
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,180
How do I...

1947
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,900
There's something above me?

1948
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:39,960
How do I...

1949
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,080
Um...

1950
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,400
How puzzles solve?

1951
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,420
I don't know.

1952
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,080
Figure it out.

1953
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:48,820
Um...

1954
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:50,340
Uh...

1955
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,200
Um...

1956
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,880
Which ones can you move?

1957
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:54,780
Oh, see these?

1958
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,560
I can move all of these.

1959
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,440
So many portraits.

1960
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,150
But there's three that need to go on the wall.

1961
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:07,130
Oh.

1962
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,170
There's something above me?

1963
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,550
I don't think we can solve it just yet.

1964
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,790
I feel like there's something above me.

1965
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,190
I don't think we can solve it just yet though.

1966
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:18,750
Okay.

1967
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:19,390
Maybe?

1968
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:20,010
I don't know.

1969
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:20,870
I don't know.

1970
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:23,230
I'm not okay right now.

1971
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:24,870
Can I rotate this?

1972
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:26,830
No.

1973
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,160
Let me rotate.

1974
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,180
What do you mean I'm a great backseater?

1975
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,880
I can like put these photos up too.

1976
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,460
Yeah.

1977
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:39,740
I won't backseat.

1978
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,780
I'm just gonna sit back and relax and watch then.

1979
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,240
Conk, conk, conk.

1980
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,120
I thought you were supposed to help.

1981
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,100
Where's the assistance?

1982
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,710
I'm helping.

1983
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,570
I don't like these.

1984
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:58,050
What's that beep?

1985
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,190
I don't like these.

1986
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:03,890
Nothing happens.

1987
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:06,850
Oh.

1988
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,010
Why is granny not here?

1989
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,610
Isn't it good that granny's not here?

1990
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,250
Wait, where did my hammer go?

1991
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,270
I dropped it.

1992
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,190
Oh my god.

1993
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:15,650
No way.

1994
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,070
You dropped it and you can't find it.

1995
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:17,870
I don't.

1996
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:19,730
Where did my hammer go?

1997
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:20,650
Uh-oh.

1998
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:22,230
Where did my hammer go?

1999
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,950
Where did I drop my hammer?

2000
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:24,410
Toki, Toki.

2001
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:26,030
Why did you drop it?

2002
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,090
No, I didn't pick up the pain.

2003
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:28,830
Oh, there it is.

2004
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:29,350
Oh, there it is.

2005
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,710
There's a pattern?

2006
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:37,350
What's the pattern?

2007
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,550
There's no pattern.

2008
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,610
Is it the numbers?

2009
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,090
Like one...

2010
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:46,650
Like how many things are in there?

2011
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:49,810
Okay, so...

2012
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,650
Sorry, I haven't been paying attention this whole time.

2013
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:53,370
This.

2014
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,710
This.

2015
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,430
What's the pattern?

2016
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,510
Some of the pictures are repeated.

2017
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:08,490
Go to the hallway.

2018
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:09,950
This one is here.

2019
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,810
And then they put it here.

2020
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,950
And...

2021
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,430
Someone said go to the parents' room.

2022
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:20,330
Oh.

2023
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:20,830
Okay.

2024
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:21,870
What's in the parents' room?

2025
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:22,830
Is it...

2026
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:24,230
Oh.

2027
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,890
What was in the parents' room?

2028
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,170
Wasn't there that one lady that was repeated over and over and over again?

2029
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,450
That one ghosty picture?

2030
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,430
No, no, no.

2031
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:34,310
It's like...

2032
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,370
No?

2033
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:35,910
Okay.

2034
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:38,630
I think I vaguely remember what...

2035
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:41,150
It was like guy with no face.

2036
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:41,870
I remembered.

2037
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:43,050
Oh, you know what?

2038
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:44,470
Woman with no face.

2039
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,390
I remember that one because that one freaked me out.

2040
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:49,710
This face.

2041
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:50,450
It was...

2042
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,910
This one.

2043
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:54,210
This one freaked me out.

2044
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,310
So, I remembered it.

2045
01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:56,270
Okay.

2046
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,210
Okay.

2047
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:59,210
Um...

2048
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,950
And that one was like in the middle.

2049
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:02,910
In the middle.

2050
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:03,710
In the middle.

2051
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:05,230
In the middle.

2052
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,110
In the middle.

2053
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:07,050
Oh,

2054
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,150
they stored my sledgehammer.

2055
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:14,350
They took my sledgehammer away.

2056
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,730
They took it away.

2057
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,210
Why'd they take it?

2058
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:20,350
I literally went there so I could grab this painting.

2059
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:21,670
Oh my god.

2060
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:23,050
Wait, is it not on the floor?

2061
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:23,950
You gotta take it from here?

2062
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:26,150
They took my...

2063
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,250
They took it away.

2064
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:30,970
They took it away.

2065
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:34,310
Wait, she has no face too.

2066
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,050
Wait, I just got the same one.

2067
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:37,610
Which one was it?

2068
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,890
Which one was it?

2069
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:40,090
It was like right here.

2070
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:40,890
And then...

2071
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,630
This one.

2072
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,110
They all don't have faces either.

2073
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:47,630
No, but it was like just that one that had no face.

2074
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,190
I remember.

2075
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,350
You said the one with no face was in the middle.

2076
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,690
I don't know what I'm talking about anymore.

2077
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,890
I remember this was...

2078
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:01,890
I don't remember.

2079
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:02,770
I have no idea.

2080
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:04,050
I would go back to the parents' room.

2081
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,950
Go back to the parents' room!

2082
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,890
I don't wanna go back.

2083
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,150
You gotta go get the hammer anyway.

2084
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:12,510
Come on, it's in the storage room.

2085
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:16,290
You could probably brute force this, but...

2086
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,010
Maybe it was this one?

2087
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,590
I am of no help.

2088
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,470
Then why didn't you remember?

2089
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,590
Why didn't you remember?

2090
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,370
I didn't know it was important!

2091
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,230
I didn't know!

2092
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,350
Why didn't you remember?

2093
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,440
Everything!

2094
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,880
Oh, that room!

2095
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,540
Why didn't you look at the...

2096
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,180
I didn't look at the people, no.

2097
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,700
You should turn DVR on and then I'll rewind the VOD.

2098
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:14,940
Imagine if I turn DVR on right now.

2099
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,280
And then I'll rewind and go look at it.

2100
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,400
I got you.

2101
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,500
I'm a genius.

2102
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,080
I know.

2103
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:26,680
You're so smart.

2104
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:27,580
Wait, let me finish.

2105
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:27,880
Yeah!

2106
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,680
No way!

2107
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,220
It's rewind time.

2108
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,120
Okay.

2109
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:40,400
It's rewind.

2110
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,120
Woo!

2111
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,520
Rewind time!

2112
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,080
Is it on?

2113
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,440
No, wait, wait, wait.

2114
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,480
Alright, it's on now.

2115
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,580
I'm gonna say something really bad.

2116
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:50,740
I'm gonna say something really bad.

2117
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,000
Rewind time!

2118
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,360
Okay.

2119
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,320
Where's the grandparents room?

2120
01:13:58,740 --> 01:13:59,920
We stopped time.

2121
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:02,920
Alright.

2122
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,700
Checking?

2123
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,780
Look, I lost my... I lost my hammer, guys.

2124
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,640
I'm rewind.

2125
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,120
That's another Jack Black movie.

2126
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,760
That's...

2127
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:14,820
Okay.

2128
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,000
Wait, is this the first hole or the second hole?

2129
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,780
Okay, that's the second hole.

2130
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:20,440
Okay, hold on.

2131
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,960
The first hole!

2132
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:22,480
Yeah.

2133
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,320
Wait.

2134
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:26,580
Uh...

2135
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,120
I'm going...

2136
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,660
I'm rewinding.

2137
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,040
Yeah.

2138
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:28,740
Rewinding.

2139
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:30,320
Rewinding?

2140
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:31,320
Okay, hold on.

2141
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,580
Rewind.

2142
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:33,120
Rewind.

2143
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,220
Rewind.

2144
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:34,380
Rewind.

2145
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:34,560
Oh gosh.

2146
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,700
Wasn't there like...

2147
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,760
Wasn't there like two...

2148
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,640
Like it was...

2149
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,960
They're just the same paintings, right?

2150
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,960
For both holes?

2151
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,340
Okay.

2152
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,400
It's...

2153
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,640
How do I describe this?

2154
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:44,900
Okay.

2155
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:45,920
It's the...

2156
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:46,480
It's...

2157
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,860
How do I describe this?

2158
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,000
It's...

2159
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,920
The one that looks like Uboa.

2160
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,120
And then the one that has...

2161
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,200
The one that looks like what?

2162
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,440
Uboa.

2163
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,680
And then the one with...

2164
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,000
The skull...

2165
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,660
The skull...

2166
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:02,620
Crushed in.

2167
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,280
And then the one that looks like...

2168
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,100
The pinhead.

2169
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,360
The fuck is...

2170
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:06,620
Okay.

2171
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:07,760
We're going to look at all the pinnings.

2172
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,140
Okay.

2173
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,100
I'm closing rewind.

2174
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:10,220
Uh...

2175
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,540
Rewind time is...

2176
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,660
Did you remember what the paintings look like?

2177
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,700
Do you remember?

2178
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,340
Yes!

2179
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:15,920
Okay.

2180
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,420
Rewind time is over.

2181
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:17,900
Wait, hold on.

2182
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,360
Let me look.

2183
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,060
Wait, hold on.

2184
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,320
Let me look at the second.

2185
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:20,880
Okay.

2186
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah.

2187
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,740
Uboa, Skull Crusher, Pinhead.

2188
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,360
Okay.

2189
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:25,740
Okay.

2190
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,280
We run time over.

2191
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:27,720
Okay.

2192
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,280
Okay.

2193
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:28,940
All right.

2194
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:30,940
Okay.

2195
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,180
So we got... We got this one.

2196
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:34,620
Right.

2197
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,000
That's Uboa.

2198
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,280
That's Uboa?

2199
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,140
Yeah.

2200
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:38,980
Okay.

2201
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,080
All right.

2202
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,120
I don't know what the fuck that one was.

2203
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,760
That one, that's not important.

2204
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:47,640
Get rid of it.

2205
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,100
We don't get it.

2206
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:48,240
All right.

2207
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:48,260
Okay.

2208
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,660
That's Uboa.

2209
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,020
The fuck is Uboa?

2210
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,520
Now we need... Now we need the Skull Crusher.

2211
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:54,940
Oh!

2212
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,640
They're over there!

2213
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,120
To the... That guy is Pinhead.

2214
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,320
That's Pinhead?

2215
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:58,740
Okay.

2216
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah.

2217
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,400
He's on the far... He's on the far right.

2218
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,420
Okay.

2219
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:07,030
Okay.

2220
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,570
And now we need Skull Crusher.

2221
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,510
Go check for him.

2222
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,410
Uh... Nope.

2223
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,010
Not that.

2224
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:20,750
Hmm.

2225
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:20,830
Hmm.

2226
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:22,830
I rotate this.

2227
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:23,830
How do you rotate?

2228
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:24,370
Oh, nope.

2229
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:25,130
Throw it away.

2230
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:25,890
We don't need it.

2231
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:29,450
What's that?

2232
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:31,690
I'm trying to pick it up.

2233
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:35,470
Uh... Hmm.

2234
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:38,470
Isn't it Pinhead the guy with all the pins in his head?

2235
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,130
Wait.

2236
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:40,910
Is that Skull Crusher?

2237
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:42,670
That's Skull Crusher!

2238
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:43,790
That one?

2239
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:44,570
Yeah.

2240
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:44,730
Yeah.

2241
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,230
All right.

2242
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:45,630
In the middle.

2243
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,440
Oh!

2244
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,680
We did it!

2245
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,660
We did it!

2246
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:53,940
Oh!

2247
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:54,620
Yeah!

2248
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,540
Let me grab my disc.

2249
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,100
Oh, we're at the hospital.

2250
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:00,520
Oh, that's what the beeping's been!

2251
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,440
Oh!

2252
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:02,320
Oh!

2253
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:02,780
Oh!

2254
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:03,420
Hello, Granny.

2255
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,480
I'm here to pay you a visit.

2256
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:06,540
Oh!

2257
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:09,700
Wow.

2258
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,740
Infusion bag.

2259
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:11,260
Okay.

2260
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,080
We gotta come back.

2261
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:12,760
Aww.

2262
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,380
Hahaha.

2263
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,440
But we figured it out, so whatever.

2264
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,480
Oh, it's like that new Thunderbolts movie where they turn into shadows.

2265
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,020
What?

2266
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,420
You know, there's like a trailer of the new Marvel movie and then he turned in...

2267
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:29,740
No!

2268
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,300
Why did I close the door on myself?

2269
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,080
Oh my god, you slammed the door on yourself.

2270
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:36,740
Um...

2271
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:36,940
Leave!

2272
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:37,640
What are you doing?

2273
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:38,940
I don't think there's anything.

2274
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:39,100
I don't know.

2275
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:39,920
I just...

2276
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,700
I just felt a little safe being in that room.

2277
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,500
Yeah, that was a nice little break.

2278
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,140
Not to climb back up.

2279
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,460
Okay, this chapter is has to be the scariest chapter.

2280
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,140
I'm not okay right now.

2281
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,440
I'm actually not okay.

2282
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,700
If your rewind is still on, just refresh and it'll stop.

2283
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,220
It'll stop.

2284
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:02,000
I'm not okay at the moment.

2285
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,800
Wait, but...

2286
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,460
We're fine.

2287
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,480
We're fine.

2288
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,120
We're fine.

2289
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,640
I don't...

2290
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:12,980
They took my hammer.

2291
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:13,640
Who's here?

2292
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,400
Oh my gosh, they're here!

2293
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:16,800
They took my hammer.

2294
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,600
How do I...

2295
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,760
How do I get my stuff back?

2296
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,580
Also, the door to the...

2297
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,720
Is that the door to the basement?

2298
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,940
The one that's all blocked up?

2299
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,200
How do I get my hammer?

2300
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:32,980
Pizza!

2301
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:33,440
Pizza!

2302
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,180
Wait, how do I get my hammer?

2303
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,540
Open the door, open the door.

2304
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,800
How do I get to the storage?

2305
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,440
I don't know.

2306
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:44,940
But maybe...

2307
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,720
What are you trying to...

2308
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,840
They're just a guest?

2309
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,820
You trying to bludgeon them?

2310
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,020
Wait, have I...

2311
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,320
Have I broken that mirror yet?

2312
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,700
Yeah, you broke that one.

2313
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:54,420
Okay.

2314
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,140
Oh, I have to go through the garage.

2315
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,500
Wait, is that another mirror?

2316
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:58,960
Yes, it is.

2317
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,420
Oh, I haven't...

2318
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,260
I already broke that.

2319
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,440
Wait, what?

2320
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,580
Oh, the doors are locked.

2321
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,680
What's going on?

2322
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,640
What's going on?

2323
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,220
It's because they're annoyed about the alarm.

2324
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,020
They don't want you to go anywhere until you turn off the car alarm.

2325
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:22,340
Oh, is she about to kill you?

2326
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:23,180
I think she's about to kill you.

2327
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:26,880
Oh.

2328
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,740
Wait, who was at the door?

2329
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,600
Who was phone?

2330
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,180
Beep, beep, beep.

2331
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,580
We're back here.

2332
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,140
Hello, Grandma.

2333
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:40,920
Hello.

2334
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,000
I think there's one in there too, by the way.

2335
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,460
Yeah, but they took my hammer.

2336
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,500
Yeah, and there's two more right here.

2337
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,500
Oh my God, Doki.

2338
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,360
Oh, who are you calling?

2339
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,200
Wait, why'd you hang up?

2340
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:00,700
They called me.

2341
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:01,240
Who are you calling?

2342
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:01,940
I don't know.

2343
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,140
They called me first.

2344
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,520
Wait, I didn't hear anything.

2345
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:06,880
Did you?

2346
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,660
You're going crazy.

2347
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,920
It was flashing.

2348
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:11,920
It was flashing.

2349
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,960
Oh, why didn't you wait?

2350
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,440
Now there's babies here.

2351
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,680
We got to deal with grandmas and babies.

2352
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,820
There's so many things.

2353
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,160
I think we missed the whatever the door was.

2354
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,160
I can't get my hand

2355
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,940
in the basement.

2356
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,160
Yeah, actually, I don't know what to do.

2357
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,840
How do I get to the basement?

2358
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,900
There's a second door.

2359
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,700
To the kitchen, no?

2360
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,920
No, they locked it.

2361
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:56,400
I can't smash anything.

2362
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,680
Hey, later.

2363
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,340
There's a soft lock?

2364
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:11,900
I accidentally soft lock myself because I left the hammer in the store.

2365
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:15,720
No.

2366
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:19,680
No.

2367
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,340
Go through the kitchen.

2368
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,940
We don't know how to get to the kitchen.

2369
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:24,760
That's the issue.

2370
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,180
How do we get to the kitchen?

2371
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,100
There's got to be a way.

2372
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,040
How do I get to the kitchen?

2373
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,260
Here, keep going.

2374
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:37,780
Turn around.

2375
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,340
Keep going.

2376
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,340
Keep going that way.

2377
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,880
And then...

2378
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,480
Next to the laundry?

2379
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,220
Living room door?

2380
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,540
Where's the living room door?

2381
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,120
I don't know.

2382
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,000
Just keep walking.

2383
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:57,820
I'm so confused.

2384
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,820
And try left.

2385
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,280
This way.

2386
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:01,760
Oh, wait.

2387
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,480
Yeah, see?

2388
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:03,640
We're here.

2389
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,220
Okay, this is the laundry room.

2390
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:08,100
Wait.

2391
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,060
But which one's the basement door?

2392
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,640
Isn't it not that one down there?

2393
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,480
That's the basement door.

2394
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,920
Wait, that's the basement door.

2395
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,300
I...

2396
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,340
I saw one.

2397
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,160
I saw one.

2398
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:25,200
I saw one.

2399
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:25,920
It's impossible.

2400
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,560
You can just...

2401
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,260
I didn't mean this.

2402
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:31,890
I didn't mean this.

2403
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:47,930
I didn't mean this.

2404
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,750
I can't do this now!

2405
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,870
Last auto-save?

2406
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,810
Latest auto-save?

2407
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:06,630
Where were we?

2408
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:10,310
Okay, let's try latest auto-save number four.

2409
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:11,750
Wait, no.

2410
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:12,930
Someone said go to the garage.

2411
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:17,030
There was another door in there, though, but it was also locked up, you guys.

2412
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:17,550
It was locked.

2413
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:18,410
Locked, yeah.

2414
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,570
There was a... it was locked up in there.

2415
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:21,250
We saw it.

2416
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,490
Mirror before the garage.

2417
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:27,350
Okay.

2418
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:29,150
Okay.

2419
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:31,790
Okay.

2420
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:32,530
Okay.

2421
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:33,630
Okay.

2422
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:36,310
The mirror behind the door by the garage.

2423
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,090
Then I took my sledgehammer.

2424
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,330
They took it.

2425
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:42,110
Yeah, the one down here.

2426
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2427
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:43,910
This one.

2428
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:45,270
Try this one.

2429
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:48,750
Okay.

2430
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,710
Okay.

2431
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:49,790
Okay.

2432
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:51,890
Wait, I never got here?

2433
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,870
Oh, I thought you said that you couldn't.

2434
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,450
Oh, I was like, did I go here before?

2435
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,010
And you were like, yeah.

2436
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:01,330
And I was like, okay.

2437
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,110
I didn't say that.

2438
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:04,850
I remember you said that.

2439
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:05,330
Why are you blaming me?

2440
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,490
Maybe there's like the voices in my head.

2441
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,670
You were just, you went up to it.

2442
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,590
And you were just like, oh, I've already been here.

2443
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:14,850
No, no.

2444
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,470
You were like, you've been here before.

2445
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:17,470
And I was like, okay.

2446
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,630
What?

2447
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:20,350
I didn't want to say that.

2448
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,510
Oh, yay, the basement.

2449
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,630
Oh, we're in the basement.

2450
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:26,930
Yay.

2451
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:29,510
Okay, we didn't have to restart.

2452
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:30,590
Everything's fine.

2453
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:31,790
Everything is okay.

2454
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:32,430
All right, go to storage.

2455
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,930
Go to storage.

2456
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:34,790
Where's the storage?

2457
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,190
Um, remember to there.

2458
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:38,650
Oh, yeah.

2459
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:40,270
And it has a sign on it.

2460
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:40,570
Yeah.

2461
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,450
That says storage room.

2462
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:44,250
There it is.

2463
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:44,790
There it is.

2464
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:45,710
Nice.

2465
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:50,870
All right, and there was a mirror right here.

2466
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,530
Yippee.

2467
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,430
Wait, where's the mirror?

2468
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,510
Right there.

2469
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:58,070
Yep.

2470
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:58,450
Oh, okay.

2471
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:00,750
All right.

2472
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:01,650
All right, let's go.

2473
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,210
Smash or pass?

2474
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,030
Smash!

2475
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:07,290
Yay!

2476
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:12,050
Oh.

2477
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:12,790
Thank you.

2478
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:12,970
Oh.

2479
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:17,610
Thank you, everybody who helps with that.

2480
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:18,750
Thank you, guys.

2481
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:20,590
We appreciate it.

2482
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:21,250
Yeah.

2483
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:21,850
Yeah.

2484
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:26,810
But I feel like we would have figured it out in the end anyway, but thanks, guys.

2485
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:30,840
All right.

2486
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:32,080
And then I know...

2487
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,480
She was on the load menu.

2488
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:34,740
Like, ready to...

2489
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:38,540
Literally seconds away from pushing the button.

2490
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:40,920
I don't know about that.

2491
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,400
I don't know about that.

2492
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

2493
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:45,940
Wait, what do we do now?

2494
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,040
Keep finding more mirrors.

2495
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:51,140
I think you can leave through that door and then go smash the other mirrors.

2496
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:54,820
Um...

2497
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:55,520
Oh.

2498
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,900
It doesn't open anymore.

2499
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:58,200
Yeah.

2500
01:25:59,040 --> 01:25:59,800
Okay, we have...

2501
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:00,360
Maybe in here?

2502
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,560
Maybe there's another mirror in here?

2503
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:01,900
No, that's our...

2504
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:03,360
That's our light swap switches.

2505
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,940
Yeah, but what if there's a mirror in front of it?

2506
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,560
Why is it so noisy down there?

2507
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,840
I'm confused.

2508
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:14,640
Um...

2509
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,100
Um...

2510
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:16,960
Maybe...

2511
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,120
Go in here?

2512
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:19,800
No, that...

2513
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,220
They locked us up.

2514
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:20,980
Oh wait, can you...

2515
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,420
Oh no, you can't go through the garage.

2516
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:22,960
No, go...

2517
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,540
Don't go up.

2518
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,060
Go to...

2519
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:24,440
Go around.

2520
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:25,320
They locked us up.

2521
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:27,240
Were we just here?

2522
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:28,680
Yeah, but there's like the...

2523
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,000
No.

2524
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:29,880
Wait.

2525
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,480
Whoa!

2526
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,100
No.

2527
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,140
Yes!

2528
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:34,940
No.

2529
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,340
That might be our way in!

2530
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,140
No.

2531
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:40,060
No.

2532
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,120
Smash!

2533
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:42,800
Smash!

2534
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,160
Move that bus!

2535
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:45,880
No.

2536
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,900
There has to be other ways.

2537
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:50,820
Why are you so afraid of smashing the wall?

2538
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,520
There has to be other...

2539
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,780
It has...

2540
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:57,960
You'd rather go down the dark hallway than smash the wall in the brightly lit room?

2541
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,100
I have this, so...

2542
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,560
Okay, then go down the hall.

2543
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,000
I don't see if I can.

2544
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:06,600
Yeah.

2545
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,060
Go break the wall.

2546
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,200
Okay.

2547
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,820
She's afraid of commitment.

2548
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,080
What's...

2549
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,940
This is like the least scary thing.

2550
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:20,920
To smash the wall.

2551
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,580
Yeah, but like...

2552
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,100
Maybe we're not supposed to go down here.

2553
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,940
I think we are because we're...

2554
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:28,100
...here.

2555
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,040
Smash!

2556
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:34,380
Smash!

2557
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:35,560
Smash!

2558
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,320
Maybe grandma's living in the walls.

2559
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,760
Oh, she's in our walls?

2560
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:40,800
Yeah.

2561
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:42,840
And she's naked.

2562
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,960
Granny needs a bath.

2563
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:47,340
Oh, we're gonna...

2564
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,600
It's time to give granny a little bath.

2565
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,720
Oh, we're gonna go...

2566
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,700
Yeah, I mean, she'll look at...

2567
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,900
It's so dusty in here.

2568
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,060
Oh, I don't like this place.

2569
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,000
Man, I don't like it.

2570
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,360
She's in our walls.

2571
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,260
She's naked in our walls.

2572
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:00,760
Oh.

2573
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,300
What's this?

2574
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,300
A second basement?

2575
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,920
These people are so rich.

2576
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:08,160
They have like three basements.

2577
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,160
Wait, go back.

2578
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:11,800
What are you doing?

2579
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,620
I'm not gonna shoot myself.

2580
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,960
That's where I kill them.

2581
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,220
And then I just finish the job.

2582
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:17,820
Wait, is that...

2583
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:18,120
I think there's a hand.

2584
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,960
I'm not gonna finish the job.

2585
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,960
I think we have to.

2586
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,320
Okay.

2587
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,700
If I die, we end stream.

2588
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:29,600
Okay.

2589
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:30,280
Okay.

2590
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,100
You know what?

2591
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:31,740
I take that.

2592
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,080
Now you have a gun to shoot, grandma.

2593
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,580
This is just liar's bar.

2594
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:39,460
What are you talking about?

2595
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:40,620
Yeah.

2596
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,040
All right.

2597
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,240
Oh.

2598
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,460
Game the gun at your head.

2599
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,680
And there's six bullets.

2600
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,140
Shall I take this Russian roulette?

2601
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:53,180
Six shots.

2602
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:58,840
Surely, surely I'll miss, guys.

2603
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,520
Um.

2604
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,340
What if they're all blanked?

2605
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:06,900
They're all...

2606
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:07,400
Yeah?

2607
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,380
You wanna take the shot?

2608
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,420
I like those odds.

2609
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,600
Wait, drop it and see if you can quick save.

2610
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,020
All right.

2611
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,120
What if it's a minigame?

2612
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,580
This is where the liar's bar comes in.

2613
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,300
Suddenly, like a new game boots up.

2614
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,140
I knew this was a bad hole.

2615
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah.

2616
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,940
How do we get out of here, guys?

2617
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:45,360
Yeah.

2618
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,820
Don't go towards the car.

2619
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,040
Beep.

2620
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,280
Beep.

2621
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,600
Beep.

2622
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:51,840
What if it's here?

2623
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:52,040
Oh.

2624
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:53,260
Oh.

2625
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,700
This probably leads to the kitchen.

2626
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,740
How come I can't put this...

2627
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:58,200
Okay, there you go.

2628
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,500
Smashy.

2629
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,340
Smashy.

2630
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:04,060
Okay.

2631
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,060
Oh, okay.

2632
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,940
Now I'm upstairs.

2633
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,040
I hate this game.

2634
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:11,820
Where are we?

2635
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,220
Oh wait, I like this game now.

2636
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,100
Oh my god.

2637
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:14,560
I can't...

2638
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,780
The car is...

2639
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,400
I can't do it anymore.

2640
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,160
I will leave.

2641
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,820
I will leave.

2642
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,000
I like this game.

2643
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,240
Oh wait, there's the outside.

2644
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:23,740
Oh.

2645
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:24,080
Oh.

2646
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,400
With the right tool.

2647
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,160
Yeah, let's try that.

2648
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,600
I can't use that here.

2649
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,560
Use the sledgehammer.

2650
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,900
Come on.

2651
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,420
No, it's jammed.

2652
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,060
It doesn't...

2653
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,100
I can't use that.

2654
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,440
It's glass!

2655
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,240
I need...

2656
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:35,940
Yeah, there you go.

2657
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:36,820
Yeah.

2658
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,240
That's all I got.

2659
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,140
That's all the strength I have.

2660
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,960
The car alarm is giving me like, left for dead 2, like...

2661
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,220
Bonk!

2662
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:48,500
Do that to grandma.

2663
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,080
Okay.

2664
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,260
Well, obviously it wasn't here.

2665
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,420
We need something to pry it open, but we're...

2666
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,500
What the hell did you just throw?

2667
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,620
I didn't throw anything.

2668
01:30:59,840 --> 01:30:59,960
Oh.

2669
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:01,140
Wait, what did you hear?

2670
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,900
Oh, I think...

2671
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,120
I saw like a leaf fall from the...

2672
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:06,960
I can't use this.

2673
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,460
It won't let me use the crowbar.

2674
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:09,800
No.

2675
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,300
It's like a...

2676
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:11,820
Richie thing.

2677
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,000
The horde is incoming.

2678
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,180
Okay.

2679
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:24,500
Well, that's another mirror.

2680
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,600
I'm gonna find another mirror.

2681
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,040
Oh my god.

2682
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,860
How many mirrors are in here?

2683
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:30,920
There's a lot.

2684
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,660
We saw how many.

2685
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:34,900
Okay.

2686
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,060
Yeah, use that.

2687
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,120
Maybe go down towards the light area.

2688
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:38,760
Yeah, over here.

2689
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,120
Yeah, I was thinking maybe there's another mirror here.

2690
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,760
There's probably one in the dark hallway.

2691
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,320
That probably leads back up to the kitchen.

2692
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,520
Because this is gonna be...

2693
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,040
See, this one's gonna be all boarded up, no?

2694
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:07,860
Oh, there's one in here.

2695
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:07,940
Oh, there's one in here.

2696
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:08,360
There's...

2697
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,320
It's the mirror right next to it.

2698
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,280
Nice.

2699
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,260
Wait, this leads outside.

2700
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,940
I'm outside now.

2701
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,120
See, this is nice.

2702
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,140
This is nice.

2703
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:20,200
I can live here.

2704
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,560
It's like that Chillizart game that just came out.

2705
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:25,140
Oh, yeah.

2706
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:25,880
Wait.

2707
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:26,540
What?

2708
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,500
You're in the dark?

2709
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:27,800
I'm...

2710
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,600
What?

2711
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:29,660
What?

2712
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,600
What?

2713
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:30,700
What?

2714
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:31,300
I'm outside.

2715
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,440
Look, there's the sun.

2716
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:33,680
What?

2717
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,140
I don't think...

2718
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:34,840
What sun?

2719
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,580
Go to the light.

2720
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,700
Go to the light.

2721
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,460
And I'm...

2722
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,180
My eyes.

2723
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:42,960
I'm back home.

2724
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:43,840
Oh.

2725
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,380
Oh.

2726
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:44,720
Looped you.

2727
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,700
Oh, wait.

2728
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,700
Silent Hilled me.

2729
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:48,580
We're...

2730
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:49,420
No, this is Britain.

2731
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:53,040
Can't wait to get shanked.

2732
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:55,880
What's it?

2733
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:56,160
Wait.

2734
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:57,080
Because there's a door open.

2735
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:57,980
That little gate?

2736
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:58,640
No.

2737
01:32:59,520 --> 01:32:59,760
No?

2738
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:01,340
What?

2739
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,600
There's gotta be something here.

2740
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,320
Where do I go?

2741
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:06,520
No.

2742
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:06,920
No?

2743
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:08,900
Uh...

2744
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,480
Wait, it doesn't open like a normal door where you have to hold it?

2745
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,000
No.

2746
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:16,810
See?

2747
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:19,050
Whack.

2748
01:33:20,110 --> 01:33:20,470
Whack.

2749
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,090
What the fuck is a crowbar?

2750
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:25,130
Wait.

2751
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:28,550
Oh, I think I saw...

2752
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:29,390
Oh, just kidding.

2753
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:30,370
I thought I saw it.

2754
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:30,910
You saw this?

2755
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:32,010
Yeah, I saw that.

2756
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:33,290
You saw this little merry-go-round?

2757
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:34,490
Yeah, I saw the merry-go-round.

2758
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:37,210
Just yanked the metal bar from the...

2759
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:40,210
Probably...

2760
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:40,690
Like...

2761
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,490
Rusted enough for it that you'd be able to do it.

2762
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,410
Oh my god.

2763
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,550
They just want you to have a moment of whimsy.

2764
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:47,590
You should go down the slide.

2765
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,390
No!

2766
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:49,950
Oh!

2767
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:50,910
Oh!

2768
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:51,090
No!

2769
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:52,190
No!

2770
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:52,990
I'm sad.

2771
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:55,290
Go down the slide.

2772
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:56,230
Go down the slide.

2773
01:33:56,610 --> 01:33:57,510
It'll make you feel better.

2774
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:58,230
Yeah, you're right.

2775
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,810
It would.

2776
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:01,170
If I could, I'm too old for the slide.

2777
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:02,390
Oh, wait.

2778
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:02,810
Wait.

2779
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:04,430
Wait.

2780
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:05,070
No.

2781
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:07,490
I can't get over the last couple of steps.

2782
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:08,490
It's so messed up.

2783
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:09,190
It's so messed up.

2784
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:11,250
Why would you get rid of my whimsy?

2785
01:34:11,650 --> 01:34:12,290
Why?

2786
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:18,370
Why did I have one thing in life?

2787
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:19,290
Oh, you missed.

2788
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:22,930
You missed.

2789
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:27,810
I can't have nothing.

2790
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:32,750
The moment of whimsy starts clapping horses.

2791
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:33,190
There's clapping horses.

2792
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:37,250
Well, that horse is going crazy.

2793
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:39,690
How'd you hit that one when you aim for the other one?

2794
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:40,170
All right.

2795
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:43,530
There's gotta be something here though, no?

2796
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:45,530
It has to be like another mirror, right?

2797
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:49,090
How do we get...

2798
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:50,970
I don't know.

2799
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:52,530
There's a ladder next to a mirror?

2800
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:54,470
What the fuck?

2801
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:58,510
Oh, it's going crazy.

2802
01:34:58,630 --> 01:34:59,270
Did I do that?

2803
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:02,590
It says ride me.

2804
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:03,990
Moment of whimsy.

2805
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:06,170
It's the moment of whimsy time.

2806
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:08,350
Oh, I did that.

2807
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:10,030
You might have actually done that.

2808
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:12,310
I'm like, is that a ghost?

2809
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:13,710
I'm the ghost.

2810
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:22,090
Oh wait, there's a ladder.

2811
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:25,190
Exactly what people said.

2812
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:26,610
I can't go...

2813
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:28,150
I can't go up this ladder.

2814
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:29,150
Oh.

2815
01:35:29,410 --> 01:35:31,750
Oh, it was just cosmetics, I guess.

2816
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:36,410
Um, there has to be another mirror, I guess then, that we missed.

2817
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:41,610
I just don't understand that because there's nothing that we can interact with at all, so I don't even know what to do.

2818
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:42,870
Yeah, I'm so confused.

2819
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:43,270
Nothing that...

2820
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,470
Well, you're playing the game, I don't know.

2821
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:46,090
Maybe there's something in here, just not touching it.

2822
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,540
Why is it so dark?

2823
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:51,120
Hello?

2824
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,100
Don't stand in the dark for too long.

2825
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:56,140
I see your brain!

2826
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:56,880
I see your brain!

2827
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:57,540
I see your brain!

2828
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,740
Go back to the light!

2829
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,560
Go back to the light!

2830
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:03,080
I'm going back.

2831
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,440
I'm back here.

2832
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:11,370
It's still pretty red.

2833
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,250
What happened?

2834
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:16,350
Okay, we're back in the light.

2835
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:20,110
Um, maybe there's one in the storage closet?

2836
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,210
In the storage room?

2837
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:24,950
Wait, they brought my hammer back.

2838
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:26,990
Wait, I think there is actually.

2839
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:29,290
This one?

2840
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:30,050
Does that count?

2841
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:31,210
Yeah, I hear...

2842
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:31,830
It's making noises.

2843
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:34,990
I think it counts.

2844
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,150
I'm going to take my pills real quick.

2845
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:38,650
I don't like that I can see my brain.

2846
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:39,270
No, no, I don't think you...

2847
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:40,810
No, you can't, you can't.

2848
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:42,030
Don't waste your pills, don't waste your pills.

2849
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:43,390
I see my brain!

2850
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:45,050
Yeah, but it's not red.

2851
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:45,890
Don't waste it.

2852
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:46,870
But I see it.

2853
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:49,350
Is it bad to see your brain?

2854
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:49,790
Yeah.

2855
01:36:50,610 --> 01:36:51,830
I didn't even know you had one.

2856
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:54,070
What if you put a candle right there?

2857
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:55,290
And it'll light up the room.

2858
01:36:56,590 --> 01:36:57,670
I don't have a candle.

2859
01:36:58,750 --> 01:36:59,010
Oh.

2860
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:01,630
You did.

2861
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,350
Oh, never mind.

2862
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:09,550
I lied.

2863
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:12,050
But it's making sounds!

2864
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:16,570
All the mirrors make sounds, no?

2865
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:22,610
What are we missing?

2866
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:24,650
The stool.

2867
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:25,950
What's the stool for?

2868
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:28,090
Oh, you might want to take your pills.

2869
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:30,190
Oh, I see my brain.

2870
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:31,850
It's like really red.

2871
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:39,590
I don't like this no more.

2872
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:41,810
It's not fun no more.

2873
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,930
Your sanity is decreasing fast.

2874
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:45,110
Oh my god, take your pills.

2875
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:50,100
Okay, I'm okay.

2876
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,200
There was a path in the park?

2877
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:53,920
There was?

2878
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:54,800
There was?

2879
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,040
Where at?

2880
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:58,960
No, there wasn't.

2881
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,500
No, there wasn't.

2882
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,360
There might have been.

2883
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,020
I'm so confused.

2884
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,160
I'm so confused.

2885
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,420
The gun?

2886
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:25,800
Yeah, you could always do the gun.

2887
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,640
I'm so confused.

2888
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,780
Wait, there's a step here.

2889
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,400
Where do I put the steps to?

2890
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:40,600
I don't know.

2891
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:44,060
I hate this level.

2892
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,480
This level fucking sucks.

2893
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,800
This is really obtuse.

2894
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,120
Like, it's not linear at all.

2895
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,060
Hold on.

2896
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:50,600
I'll look.

2897
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:51,160
Let's see.

2898
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,280
This level fucking sucks.

2899
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,680
Next to the wardrobe in the basement.

2900
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,080
It's where...

2901
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,180
There's a wardrobe in the...

2902
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,980
Next to the wardrobe in the basement.

2903
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:08,800
What wardrobe?

2904
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,140
Did we get that one already?

2905
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,640
Okay, so this is the park, right?

2906
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:15,900
Yeah.

2907
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:19,060
And then also, it just like randomly takes away your sledgehammer.

2908
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:19,560
Like, I don't know.

2909
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,240
Why does it do that?

2910
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,080
Because I threw it away because I wanted to use my lighter.

2911
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:24,360
Oh.

2912
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:26,780
There's no...

2913
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,040
There's no crowbar here.

2914
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:32,190
Hold on.

2915
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:32,650
I'm licking.

2916
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:34,990
Uh...

2917
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:36,710
Interact with the open grave.

2918
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:37,850
There's a grave somewhere.

2919
01:39:37,850 --> 01:39:39,530
There's a fucking grave?!

2920
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:43,030
Who died?!

2921
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:44,050
In the park!

2922
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:46,850
Why is there a grave in the park?

2923
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:47,170
Yeah!

2924
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:50,110
Why the fuck would you plant a grave with all the children here?

2925
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:52,910
It's multi-use.

2926
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:00,290
Someone said you need the compass, but I...

2927
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:01,150
How do I...

2928
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:03,010
I passed it?

2929
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:05,870
Uh...

2930
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:06,850
Wait, the compass...

2931
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:09,490
Bro, my sanity is decreasing being in this park!

2932
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,330
Why is my sanity decreasing in the park?

2933
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:13,090
It's...

2934
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,670
It's the whimsy!

2935
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:18,910
Uh...

2936
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:21,590
Hold on, I'm looking at where the crowbar is.

2937
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,050
Um...

2938
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:31,250
Use the crowbar.

2939
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:33,250
Where do we get the crowbar?

2940
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,210
Here, it's apparently...

2941
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,150
Next to a wardrobe?

2942
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:39,570
The fuck is a wardrobe?!

2943
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:41,050
See, I said the wardrobe!

2944
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:43,630
You don't even know where the wardrobe is!

2945
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:44,670
I have no idea.

2946
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:46,590
You read that from chat!

2947
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:49,250
No, I read it from the...

2948
01:40:49,250 --> 01:40:51,230
From ScreenRant.com!

2949
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:53,350
Okay, as if that makes it any better.

2950
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,350
I literally read...

2951
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:59,830
Even before I was like, the wardrobe, Doki, you have to go to the wardrobe in the basement!

2952
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:00,450
Oh my god!

2953
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,490
Oh, that's probably the one I was hearing.

2954
01:41:04,050 --> 01:41:04,410
That's...

2955
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:06,910
There it is!

2956
01:41:08,090 --> 01:41:09,170
There it is!

2957
01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:10,730
Yeah.

2958
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:14,880
And...

2959
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,080
Bush!

2960
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:19,560
Oh, it's useless now.

2961
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:19,940
What do you mean?

2962
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:23,780
Oh my god, I'm in the dark.

2963
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,340
Do this not in the...

2964
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,000
Yeah, don't do that.

2965
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,160
No, I'm trying to, but it won't let me store the thing!

2966
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:36,900
Oh, I...

2967
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:37,740
There's nothing in the...

2968
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,740
Oh my god, I have no more pills.

2969
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:39,860
I have no more pills.

2970
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,200
I have no more pills.

2971
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,800
I have no more pills.

2972
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,080
It's fine, we'll make it through.

2973
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:50,940
I have no more pills.

2974
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,200
Once we know what to do, we'll be fast if we die.

2975
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,920
The cat is gonna kill me!

2976
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,820
She's gonna get me!

2977
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,500
Just stay in the light!

2978
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,740
I'm pill-less!

2979
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:02,340
I have a lighter though.

2980
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:05,020
I don't know why the lighters are useless.

2981
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:06,080
That's so rude!

2982
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:09,280
Oh!

2983
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:12,440
Oh my god, god will save me, right?

2984
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:13,180
We're crawling?

2985
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:13,380
We're crawling?

2986
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,380
Can you use the lighter?

2987
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:18,760
I'm going crazy.

2988
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:21,280
I don't need this.

2989
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:23,500
I need these.

2990
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,600
I don't think you can go crazy in these areas.

2991
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:29,460
Like these special areas.

2992
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:30,800
So that's nice at least.

2993
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,620
Okay, I have to go here.

2994
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:47,980
I wish I put her in the home.

2995
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,920
I told you to put Dolores in the home.

2996
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,160
I told you.

2997
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,960
I told you we should have put it down there.

2998
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,360
Oh, you meant...

2999
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:55,880
You said a home.

3000
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,420
I thought you meant our home.

3001
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,680
I told you she should have...

3002
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:06,640
Where am I?

3003
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,260
What the?

3004
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,200
Oh, you went in a circle.

3005
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:10,120
Why?

3006
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:11,840
Why?

3007
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,400
Maybe you're supposed to find the...

3008
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,320
What am I supposed to do?

3009
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:23,280
Hold on.

3010
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:27,600
Just look around before you leave.

3011
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,300
Is there like anything in here?

3012
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,600
There's more crosses here.

3013
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:33,060
Oh, look.

3014
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:33,780
Happy Easter.

3015
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:34,940
It's John.

3016
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,020
John?

3017
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:39,300
Who's John?

3018
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,300
It's John.

3019
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:47,350
Okay.

3020
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:48,330
What's in here?

3021
01:43:48,850 --> 01:43:50,430
Oh, that's where they put John.

3022
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:51,650
John!

3023
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:52,770
Oh, pull that.

3024
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:53,110
Pull that.

3025
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,410
Pull the lever.

3026
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:59,590
I'm trying to pull the lever.

3027
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:01,570
But he won't let me pull.

3028
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:03,830
Oh, crap.

3029
01:44:04,290 --> 01:44:04,910
Hello?

3030
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:07,090
It's John Easter.

3031
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:09,090
Oh, crank!

3032
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:09,630
Crank is me!

3033
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:11,610
Okay.

3034
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:14,370
Okay.

3035
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:15,610
Okay.

3036
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:17,270
Okay.

3037
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:18,490
Okay.

3038
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:19,250
Okay.

3039
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:19,390
Okay.

3040
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:20,070
Ow, ow.

3041
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:22,130
We're putting her in a hole.

3042
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:25,410
Hold on.

3043
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,690
Let me see what I can find.

3044
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:30,290
There must be a lever in here.

3045
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,440
I don't understand.

3046
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,160
I don't...

3047
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,320
Oh, but, uh...

3048
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,980
I don't understand.

3049
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:41,180
I don't...

3050
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:42,140
I don't understand.

3051
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:49,420
Use the manual crank from the mirror one puzzle.

3052
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,020
What?

3053
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:52,020
What?

3054
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:52,380
What?

3055
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:52,760
The mirror...

3056
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,020
The mirror one was...

3057
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,100
Oh, there...

3058
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,480
Oh, okay.

3059
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:05,060
Remember in that room where we saw, like, the grandma lunge at us?

3060
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,900
Apparently, there was a crank in there.

3061
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:07,640
What?

3062
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:08,780
What?

3063
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:09,960
What?

3064
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:14,180
What?

3065
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:14,860
I didn't...

3066
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:15,720
I didn't pick up any crank.

3067
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,060
I didn't...

3068
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:17,580
I didn't...

3069
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:17,940
What?

3070
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,700
I'm gonna bring the mirror to the end of the hall.

3071
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,100
I used the switch hammer to break...

3072
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:24,420
Do we get soft locked?

3073
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:25,840
No.

3074
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,520
Take the plank to cross the floor.

3075
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:30,920
Ah!

3076
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:31,580
Ah!

3077
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:34,260
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3078
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:35,240
All right.

3079
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,180
This...

3080
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:37,660
This guide sucks.

3081
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:39,380
I'm leaving.

3082
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,700
Where is a plank?

3083
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,660
Apparently, there was one.

3084
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:44,940
Oh my god.

3085
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:45,420
Maybe you can...

3086
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:46,180
That one right there.

3087
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:46,660
This one?

3088
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:47,420
Is that plank?

3089
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,360
No, maybe...

3090
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:50,400
Oh.

3091
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:52,980
Why can't I pick you up?

3092
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:54,840
Uh...

3093
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,640
Below the stairs.

3094
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,000
Oh my god.

3095
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:58,760
I'm gonna fucking freak out.

3096
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:00,700
You already are.

3097
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:02,560
What about that?

3098
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,140
There you go, there you go.

3099
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,800
There's so much wood around me.

3100
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,740
But it has to be the wood of God.

3101
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:09,240
I have...

3102
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,520
It's symbolism!

3103
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:16,320
This was blessed by Jesus almighty to let me cross the fucking ocean.

3104
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,380
Oh my god.

3105
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:20,400
Oh my god.

3106
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:20,540
There you go.

3107
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:21,860
There you go.

3108
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:22,660
Jesus is a little wide.

3109
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,020
Where is it?

3110
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:26,620
Turn around.

3111
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:27,520
Oh my god.

3112
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:28,820
There it is.

3113
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:29,060
Yeah.

3114
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,200
Okay.

3115
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:36,580
I...

3116
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,300
Jesus please.

3117
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,260
Oh mighty.

3118
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:40,220
Jesus please.

3119
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,840
Oh my god.

3120
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:42,220
Oh my god.

3121
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:42,520
We...

3122
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,440
Of course we chose the thinnest piece of wood too.

3123
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,300
I need...

3124
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,260
I need to blow my nose.

3125
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,000
I need more tissue.

3126
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:48,800
I'll be right back.

3127
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,240
I...

3128
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:49,660
Okay.

3129
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:50,860
I need water too.

3130
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:53,240
Okay.

3131
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,780
Wow, she left so fast.

3132
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:56,940
Oh.

3133
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,300
She's gone.

3134
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,540
Oh.

3135
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:03,800
She's gone.

3136
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:07,820
This...

3137
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:09,120
Okay, I'm gonna find a better walkthrough.

3138
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,740
Because this...

3139
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:10,600
This one...

3140
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:11,980
Screenrant.com.

3141
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:12,720
You suck.

3142
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,260
They only...

3143
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:15,480
Well, you know, I...

3144
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:18,180
They wanted you to do the mirrors in a certain order.

3145
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,760
And Doki definitely did not.

3146
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,980
She just kind of went off on her own.

3147
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,000
I had no time to stop her.

3148
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:27,140
So...

3149
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:27,780
Um...

3150
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:35,060
Oh, there are pills in the bathroom.

3151
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:37,400
And...

3152
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,400
I wonder if she already grabbed those though.

3153
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,700
Like, are they pills that...

3154
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,780
Regenerate or...

3155
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:46,640
Yeah, I'm back.

3156
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,740
I'm back.

3157
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,280
And like, our biggest issue is the fact that we don't have any pills.

3158
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,200
So, I don't know what to do.

3159
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:54,420
I'm...

3160
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:54,710
Um...

3161
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:55,660
Yeah?

3162
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,380
It says...

3163
01:47:58,060 --> 01:47:58,640
Uh...

3164
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:02,900
If we go back upstairs, we might be able to find some in the bathroom and in the parents' room.

3165
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,080
They regenerated for us?

3166
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:07,320
I don't know.

3167
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:09,260
This is just what the...

3168
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,280
NeoSeeker.com Visage 2020 Dolores chapter walkthrough says.

3169
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:18,180
Oh, hey, a shotgun.

3170
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:19,300
Whoa!

3171
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,900
Oh my god, I can shoot the ghost.

3172
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:22,920
Gear me up.

3173
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,500
Oh my god, I can shoot the ghost.

3174
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:26,660
Wait, we got him.

3175
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:27,700
This is a miracle.

3176
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:30,560
It's Resident Evil.

3177
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,180
Why is there doom music all of a sudden?

3178
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,120
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3179
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:35,080
Is this Resident Evil?

3180
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,240
Oh.

3181
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:40,740
Oh.

3182
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:41,940
No way.

3183
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:43,840
We did all of that for what?

3184
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:44,580
What is this?

3185
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:45,440
What is this?

3186
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:47,060
What?

3187
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:56,830
Hello?

3188
01:48:57,450 --> 01:48:58,010
Hello?

3189
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:07,890
I swear to God, if I turn around and I see her, I swear to God.

3190
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:16,090
If I turn around and she is behind me, I swear to fucking God.

3191
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:20,910
Okay, no.

3192
01:49:21,170 --> 01:49:21,390
Okay.

3193
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:22,250
Okay.

3194
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:23,790
What?

3195
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,350
Then what do we do?

3196
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:29,190
What do we do?

3197
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:36,370
Your fucking screen rent.com took us to an Easter egg instead of progressing that day.

3198
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:38,590
This was not the screen read guide.

3199
01:49:38,590 --> 01:49:44,530
Your fucking screen read guide took us to a goddamn easter egg.

3200
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:46,910
Instead of getting me out.

3201
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:49,210
Instead of finding me a fucking crowbar.

3202
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:52,790
All I needed was a crowbar.

3203
01:49:53,190 --> 01:49:53,190
The crowbar.

3204
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:59,080
Well, you went all out of order.

3205
01:49:59,240 --> 01:49:59,880
It's not my fault.

3206
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:01,380
What do you mean I went out of order?

3207
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,880
I followed your guy.

3208
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,420
I got nothing.

3209
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,040
We don't have the... How do we get the... I have to go back.

3210
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,320
I have to go back.

3211
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,760
Wait, the crowbar is... Oh my gosh.

3212
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:23,540
Let's see.

3213
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,580
All of these...

3214
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:31,120
All of these guides have a very specific order.

3215
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:32,220
They want you to do things.

3216
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,800
Oh my guide.

3217
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:38,480
Oh my guide.

3218
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:38,920
Oh my guide.

3219
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:42,100
I have to go back.

3220
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,220
Ship me my way back from that mirror.

3221
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:51,040
So I can find the first crank.

3222
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:56,060
Maybe.

3223
01:50:57,060 --> 01:50:57,900
Okay.

3224
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,060
Let's see.

3225
01:50:59,280 --> 01:50:59,420
Okay.

3226
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,720
There's a crowbar.

3227
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,960
There's a... Oh.

3228
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,160
Where's the crowbar?

3229
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,020
Where...

3230
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:09,280
It's really just not that easy to tell you where it is.

3231
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:24,730
What do you...

3232
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:28,170
Okay.

3233
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:29,970
Do you want to hear what we have to go through?

3234
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:32,790
To get the crowbar, we gotta get the butcher's knife.

3235
01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:34,830
To get the butcher's knife, we gotta go to the tea box key.

3236
01:51:34,830 --> 01:51:45,310
To get the T-box key, or then we gotta get the infusion pack, and then we gotta get the T-small key, and then we gotta get the cloud toy, then we gotta get the specialty, and then we gotta get the baby monitor, and then we gotta get the photograph hand.

3237
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:56,890
Do 80% of that fucking chapter!

3238
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:58,630
What do you mean?

3239
01:51:58,830 --> 01:52:00,390
What do you mean by baby monitor?

3240
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:04,990
What do you mean by... Oh my god!

3241
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:06,510
What?

3242
01:52:07,110 --> 01:52:08,410
Where am I?

3243
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,900
Where even are we?

3244
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,560
I don't know where we are.

3245
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,640
Yeah, me neither.

3246
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:45,740
I feel like we've done nothing to... I feel like we're at, like, the 10% of this chapter.

3247
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,020
We've done, like, nothing to actually progress.

3248
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,100
I... I don't...

3249
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,060
Yeah.

3250
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:57,180
Wait, it says, at the top of the stairs... Wait, you have to go back to where we were.

3251
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:57,540
Sorry.

3252
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:58,880
Oh, wait.

3253
01:52:58,960 --> 01:52:59,360
No, never mind.

3254
01:52:59,420 --> 01:52:59,600
Sorry.

3255
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:00,600
We got to get the crank.

3256
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:01,440
Where is the crank?

3257
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:02,180
Oh, fuck!

3258
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,260
That's what I was trying to say!

3259
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,700
Where the fuck is the crank?

3260
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:09,400
The crank is... Oh, remember where the circle mirrors were?

3261
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,300
We got to go back there.

3262
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:13,420
We have to go... Oh, my God.

3263
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,580
How do we get out of the basement?

3264
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,760
How do we get out of the basement?

3265
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:18,340
We're stuck down here!

3266
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,860
Oh, my God.

3267
01:53:26,940 --> 01:53:28,340
We're soft-locked.

3268
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:29,580
There is no way.

3269
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:32,680
I... Are we soft-locked?

3270
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:33,620
Are we actually soft-locked?

3271
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:39,260
Well, you just started doing things on your own and I was trying to help you with...

3272
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:47,260
Are we actually soft-locked?

3273
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:50,680
No, but there's probably a mirror that we can go through.

3274
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,180
There's a bathroom hole.

3275
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,580
Where was the bathroom?

3276
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,860
There's apparently a bathroom hole.

3277
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:56,140
Oh, yeah.

3278
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:57,220
In the bathroom.

3279
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:57,640
Remember?

3280
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,840
There was a bathroom.

3281
01:53:59,500 --> 01:53:59,560
Oh, my...

3282
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,000
Alright, so unpause and go to the left.

3283
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:02,500
Okay.

3284
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:05,960
Nope.

3285
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:06,400
Nope.

3286
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:06,820
Turn around.

3287
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:08,780
Turn... Yeah, that way.

3288
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:09,460
Okay.

3289
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:12,260
Okay.

3290
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,940
And it's... To the right here?

3291
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,500
Yeah, that door that's... Uh-oh.

3292
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:17,900
Oh!

3293
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:18,700
Oh!

3294
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:18,800
Oh!

3295
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,180
Just kill me.

3296
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:19,820
Just kill me.

3297
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:20,200
End me.

3298
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:21,200
Just...

3299
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:24,340
Just take me out, cranny.

3300
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:27,400
Just take me out of this world.

3301
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:38,020
Wait, but we were so close to getting out of there.

3302
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,740
Oh, my God.

3303
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:42,960
We were not close at all.

3304
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:48,040
And sweet, merciful grandma, please get me out of here.

3305
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,620
I can't...

3306
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:53,880
La la la la la la... La la la la la...

3307
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:56,360
La la la la la... Where does it take me?

3308
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,120
Oh, my God.

3309
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:02,020
There's... I like how the sledgehammer is right there.

3310
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:05,160
Okay.

3311
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,420
Do I have... Still have my... Now, right to the right.

3312
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:07,960
To the right.

3313
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:08,700
To the right.

3314
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:08,800
Okay.

3315
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:11,660
I need to get this fucking hammer out of my hand.

3316
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:14,920
Drop... Alright.

3317
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:15,660
Nice.

3318
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:16,460
Alright.

3319
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:17,200
See right there?

3320
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:17,900
The door that's open?

3321
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:18,220
Yeah.

3322
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,140
That's the bathroom.

3323
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:23,820
Oh, my fucking hole.

3324
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:24,180
Yeah.

3325
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:26,060
See, you just never looked inside here.

3326
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:26,440
Oh, my God.

3327
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,420
I don't...

3328
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:37,400
You just kind of... You just did a little peek and then you just never...

3329
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,260
You know... Oh, did you just die?

3330
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:39,680
Wow.

3331
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:40,260
That'd be nice.

3332
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:40,860
God, thank God.

3333
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:45,940
But we know how to get back to the basement.

3334
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:48,380
Now we know how to get back upstairs, so...

3335
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:49,000
Oh.

3336
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,860
Oh, my God.

3337
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,720
We're back here.

3338
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:56,200
Okay.

3339
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,180
We're back here.

3340
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:00,900
Our... Our favorite area.

3341
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:01,320
Huh?

3342
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:02,040
Oh.

3343
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:03,740
She's coming after you?

3344
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:06,410
She's behind me and she... She's behind me and she...

3345
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,720
Oh, my God.

3346
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:10,560
Oh, my God.

3347
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,020
Oh, my God.

3348
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:12,200
How... Why is she chasing us?

3349
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:13,260
Oh, my God.

3350
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:13,280
Oh, my God.

3351
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:13,420
Oh, my God.

3352
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:15,520
Like, this must be timed or something, because...

3353
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:17,920
Wait, you're going to a dead end.

3354
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:20,220
I know, but she was chasing me.

3355
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:21,040
Oh, yeah, you're fine.

3356
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:21,140
Oh, yeah, you're fine.

3357
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:23,420
Yeah, but why would you go to a dead... I guess you could have looped her in there.

3358
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:23,780
Yeah.

3359
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:25,580
Okay, where would that... I forgot.

3360
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:25,840
Okay.

3361
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:26,940
Where was that mirror?

3362
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,160
Where the fuck was that mirror?

3363
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:28,520
Upstairs.

3364
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:29,980
Okay.

3365
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:31,040
I'm pretty sure it was upstairs.

3366
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:32,640
By the...

3367
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,000
The bedroom on the other side.

3368
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:35,560
Yeah, over here.

3369
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:38,380
Right?

3370
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:40,240
There it is.

3371
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:40,600
Oh.

3372
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:41,000
Oh!

3373
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:43,260
You gotta break it.

3374
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:44,660
You gotta go get the sunshine.

3375
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,440
I'm... I hope she kills me.

3376
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:51,540
I...

3377
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:52,860
Oh, my God.

3378
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:54,100
I...

3379
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:55,260
I...

3380
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,000
I...

3381
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:01,800
Oh, go answer the door this time.

3382
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:02,600
It might kill you.

3383
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:04,580
Which door?

3384
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,280
The front door!

3385
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:06,880
Right there!

3386
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,040
The one on your left.

3387
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,280
I can't...

3388
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:13,940
Pizza.

3389
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,020
Oh, she's right there.

3390
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:15,440
Look at her.

3391
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:17,160
Oh, she's gone.

3392
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,320
It's so sad.

3393
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:19,500
Oh, she turned off all the lights.

3394
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:22,080
Oh, my God.

3395
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:24,340
Okay.

3396
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:25,980
You remember how to get downstairs, right?

3397
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:26,440
To the basement?

3398
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,060
Oh, my God!

3399
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:39,420
Weeeee!

3400
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:05,100
Oh, my God.

3401
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:10,280
What?

3402
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:13,080
Why didn't we save this chapter for last?

3403
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:14,100
Why?

3404
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,080
You chose this.

3405
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:17,460
Don't include me.

3406
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:19,440
I don't know anything about this game.

3407
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:22,140
Why?

3408
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:23,100
Where's the hole?

3409
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,560
No, no, no.

3410
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:25,260
Get the sledgehammer.

3411
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,040
Get the sledgehammer!

3412
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:34,520
The storage in this game... or the item... inventory management in this game is whack.

3413
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:37,480
This... this... it's actually whack.

3414
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,360
Oh yeah, and you still have one more chapter.

3415
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:49,240
If you... Oh, you should do like the... you know how you can have your eyes...

3416
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:51,200
have like the dark circles underneath them?

3417
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:52,500
That would be a perfect time for that.

3418
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:04,540
You're enjoying this.

3419
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:08,380
You're enjoying this.

3420
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:11,280
If I could take this hammer...

3421
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:12,720
It's what?

3422
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:13,420
To my head?

3423
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,320
Alright, upstairs.

3424
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,020
Upstairs.

3425
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:24,500
If only I could just take this hammer and end it all.

3426
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:27,120
Why is it so dark?

3427
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:29,940
Right there.

3428
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:31,560
And smash.

3429
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,740
Smashy, smashy.

3430
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,540
How is it decreasing fast?

3431
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:37,340
There's light!

3432
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,780
Oh, is this the right one?

3433
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:41,320
Hold on.

3434
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:42,780
I swear to god.

3435
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:43,560
It is.

3436
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:49,730
Uh, there might be someone chasing after you.

3437
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,070
I am hammering this as fast as I can!

3438
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:53,550
Like, I don't...

3439
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:55,430
Like, I...

3440
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:57,650
Clearly...

3441
01:59:57,650 --> 01:59:59,160
Please, please don't...

3442
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:03,070
Oh, that was close.

3443
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:07,550
Oh, there she is!

3444
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:08,410
Hello!

3445
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:10,090
She seems so nice up there!

3446
02:00:10,230 --> 02:00:11,150
I don't understand!

3447
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:13,270
I don't think she died!

3448
02:00:19,070 --> 02:00:22,470
What is grandpa-ass cough ever?

3449
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,970
I could be the grandpa.

3450
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,110
Okay.

3451
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:30,490
Okay, what's this?

3452
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:33,130
So, in this room...

3453
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,330
There are bodies hanging.

3454
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:35,170
Yeah?

3455
02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:42,530
Pick up and read the poem.

3456
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:46,150
Look, there's another lighter!

3457
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:47,790
What does it say?

3458
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:50,010
Whirling in an everlasting dream.

3459
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,070
You can read the rest.

3460
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:53,130
Oh, oh.

3461
02:00:53,470 --> 02:01:00,870
A two-sided moon with clouded vision lies down innocently by its guilty shadow.

3462
02:01:02,570 --> 02:01:05,450
Okay, so now we have to inspect the bodies.

3463
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,150
You two don't look.

3464
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:17,090
I've never actually been flagged for like... Oh, is that a person standing there or...

3465
02:01:17,090 --> 02:01:18,710
That's just another body.

3466
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:21,490
It's just shrouded in shadow.

3467
02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:24,110
Wait, there's a lot of candles.

3468
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:25,590
Yeah.

3469
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:27,810
Oh wait, there's so many candles.

3470
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:30,690
This inventory is so ass.

3471
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:31,270
I'm sorry.

3472
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:32,790
Why can't I carry more?

3473
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:34,710
I know, I don't get it.

3474
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:36,150
But don't leave just yet.

3475
02:01:36,330 --> 02:01:37,010
You got to do the puzzle.

3476
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:38,570
There's a puzzle here?

3477
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:40,590
Yes, that's what the poem is for.

3478
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:41,190
Oh.

3479
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:50,270
There will be some bodies with drawings of eye, moon, and shadow on them.

3480
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:51,650
Where?

3481
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,030
I could tell you, but I think you should find them.

3482
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:01,450
Oh, that one's for...

3483
02:02:01,450 --> 02:02:02,790
Why is it curved like that?

3484
02:02:03,250 --> 02:02:04,170
There's nothing...

3485
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:04,910
Oh, there it is.

3486
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:06,430
That's a butterfly.

3487
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:11,270
That is not an eye, a moon, or a shadow.

3488
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,270
Or wait, what is it?

3489
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:16,150
Yeah, eye, moon, shadow.

3490
02:02:16,570 --> 02:02:18,270
What does a shadow look like?

3491
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:20,090
Nothing else.

3492
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:21,450
It's just that one body.

3493
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,450
No, there's gotta be.

3494
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:28,590
I'm looking and I found one body.

3495
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:31,370
Yep, just one.

3496
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,210
Go to the other side of the room.

3497
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:33,050
Oh, there it is.

3498
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:34,050
Oh, eye!

3499
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:35,470
Okay.

3500
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:37,730
Did you interact with it?

3501
02:02:37,810 --> 02:02:38,470
Oh, there it is.

3502
02:02:39,130 --> 02:02:39,650
A moon!

3503
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:41,130
Alright, we found it all.

3504
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:42,750
Wait, did you get the shadow?

3505
02:02:44,690 --> 02:02:46,110
My sledgehammer was stored.

3506
02:02:47,050 --> 02:02:47,730
Oh, man.

3507
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:50,010
That's a butterfly.

3508
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:52,090
That's it.

3509
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,120
Is it shadow of a butterfly?

3510
02:02:58,440 --> 02:02:59,180
Oh, there it is.

3511
02:02:59,180 --> 02:02:59,480
Oh!

3512
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:02,180
Alright, remember where it is.

3513
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,420
Two are back here.

3514
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:07,340
Wait, is that it?

3515
02:03:09,060 --> 02:03:10,100
Nothing at all.

3516
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:11,280
What's the point?

3517
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:13,400
That has to be the shadow.

3518
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,840
What?

3519
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:15,860
Ah.

3520
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:16,880
This?

3521
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:18,200
Okay, try interacting with it.

3522
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:19,220
That's all I did.

3523
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:19,740
I just...

3524
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:20,760
Oh, wait, hold on.

3525
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:22,780
Proceed up the stairs.

3526
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:24,880
By the light, you will find the crank.

3527
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:26,340
Or is it this?

3528
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:29,040
Wait, this doesn't seem to depict anything at all.

3529
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:29,320
A slider.

3530
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:30,420
Maybe it's the skull.

3531
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:33,100
I think it will say shadow, no?

3532
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:35,840
Hold on.

3533
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:36,460
Uh...

3534
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:37,260
You're going so fast.

3535
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,700
I could tell you where they are, but you're going so fast!

3536
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:39,780
Oh, yeah.

3537
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:40,580
I found them.

3538
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:40,740
Okay.

3539
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:42,220
You got it!

3540
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:43,440
Alright.

3541
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,020
Okay, now I guess we can leave.

3542
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:52,060
What was the point of finding?

3543
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:53,960
The greatest horror of them all.

3544
02:03:54,540 --> 02:03:54,940
Puzzles.

3545
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:55,060
Puzzles.

3546
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:56,820
Oh.

3547
02:03:59,280 --> 02:03:59,980
Oh.

3548
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:02,140
Oh.

3549
02:04:02,140 --> 02:04:02,500
Oh.

3550
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:06,340
But I have no crank.

3551
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:07,640
It's here.

3552
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:08,760
The crank is here.

3553
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:09,900
Yay!

3554
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:13,020
Why are you so allergic to the light?

3555
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:18,580
Wait.

3556
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:18,600
Okay.

3557
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,100
Okay, so the chair...

3558
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:23,060
Use the crank to open the skylights above the bodies.

3559
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:23,800
It was these.

3560
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:25,320
With the...

3561
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,280
The ones with the drawings.

3562
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:27,220
Yeah.

3563
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:28,240
Okay.

3564
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:29,360
That's my candy.

3565
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:29,620
I'll trust.

3566
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:31,820
I'll trust you to remember.

3567
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:33,520
Wait, I said you remembered.

3568
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,000
I told you to remember it.

3569
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:40,450
It was this one, right?

3570
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,530
Well, you said it was here.

3571
02:04:41,830 --> 02:04:42,770
I mean, you opened it.

3572
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:43,190
I don't know.

3573
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:46,810
You can go back downstairs and see which one is lit up.

3574
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:47,690
I can...

3575
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:49,090
I know what to do.

3576
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:51,030
You do?

3577
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:52,110
What are you gonna do?

3578
02:04:52,750 --> 02:04:54,730
I'm gonna crank it, soldier boy.

3579
02:04:56,230 --> 02:04:57,230
Up in that...

3580
02:04:57,230 --> 02:04:57,410
Whoa!

3581
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:00,450
Watch her, crank it.

3582
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:00,910
Watch her.

3583
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,330
Whoa!

3584
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:04,490
Superman at...

3585
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:05,030
Whoa!

3586
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:09,470
Yeah.

3587
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:10,450
Ayoo!

3588
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:11,430
Ayoo!

3589
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,110
Ayoo!

3590
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:15,050
Okay, what was the other one?

3591
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:15,430
The moon.

3592
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:16,110
It was right here.

3593
02:05:17,130 --> 02:05:17,670
You remember?

3594
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:18,910
I don't know.

3595
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:24,000
Oh, I remembered.

3596
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:25,700
Wow.

3597
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:26,940
You actually did remember.

3598
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,280
I did it.

3599
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:30,640
I think you go back downstairs now.

3600
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:31,700
And it opens up that.

3601
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:32,020
Did you see me do it?

3602
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:33,840
Did you see that?

3603
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,440
I'm proud of you.

3604
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:37,400
Did you see that?

3605
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,020
How proud of you are you?

3606
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,180
Let's try that again.

3607
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:45,240
I'm not okay right now.

3608
02:05:52,710 --> 02:05:56,540
I hate this chapter so much.

3609
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:58,220
But we got the crank!

3610
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:00,160
I hate this chapter.

3611
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:00,320
I hate this chapter.

3612
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:01,320
We've made progress!

3613
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:01,560
We've made progress!

3614
02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:03,180
I don't...

3615
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:05,060
I don't want to fucking...

3616
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,300
Now we can go back to the basement.

3617
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,200
And use the crank.

3618
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:17,980
Where are we?

3619
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:19,480
I don't know anymore.

3620
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:21,540
Oh, we're in the basement!

3621
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:22,840
Oh, we're in the basement!

3622
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:23,180
Oh, we're in the basement!

3623
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,320
Oh, we're in the basement!

3624
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:25,220
Wait, why are you pausing?

3625
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:26,560
I need a moment.

3626
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:26,680
I need a moment.

3627
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:26,840
What's happening?

3628
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:27,980
Oh.

3629
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:28,720
Why?

3630
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:29,320
Nothing happened!

3631
02:06:29,860 --> 02:06:31,020
I need a moment.

3632
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:33,180
I need a moment.

3633
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:33,660
What happened?

3634
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:37,780
When the candy comes over, it takes a life.

3635
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,180
I need a moment right now.

3636
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:40,620
No, no!

3637
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:44,360
All we have to do is go to the left and that's where the crank was!

3638
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:48,120
Oh my god!

3639
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:49,580
Nothing happened!

3640
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:51,440
Grandma's not even scary!

3641
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:55,480
Uh...

3642
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:56,720
Ay-yi-yi-yi!

3643
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,240
I'm a little butterfly!

3644
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:08,280
It's so good to put you in a hole!

3645
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:09,560
I can't!

3646
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:11,440
I can't!

3647
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,280
I can't!

3648
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,040
I can't!

3649
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:15,440
I can't!

3650
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:16,060
I can't!

3651
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:16,300
I can't!

3652
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:17,400
I can't!

3653
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:17,840
I can't!

3654
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:22,280
Alright!

3655
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:23,920
Alright!

3656
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:24,060
Alright!

3657
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:24,740
Let's go!

3658
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:26,920
Woohoo!

3659
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:27,800
Woohoo!

3660
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:28,480
Woohoo!

3661
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:28,540
Woohoo!

3662
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,620
Okay.

3663
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:29,980
Okay.

3664
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,160
So go to the left.

3665
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,820
And that mirror right there.

3666
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:34,280
That's not...

3667
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,240
Oh, just run for it.

3668
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:35,800
Run for it.

3669
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:36,200
Run for it.

3670
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:36,400
Go!

3671
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:36,760
No, no!

3672
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:38,700
Why did you not go to the mirror?

3673
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:44,400
Oh, is this...

3674
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,000
Oh, you're right.

3675
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:46,100
Yeah!

3676
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:48,260
Yeah, you wanna know why I didn't go to that mirror?

3677
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,260
Yeah, that's okay, right?

3678
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:51,340
I...

3679
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:51,680
Oh.

3680
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,480
I'm the backseater.

3681
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:58,000
I'm the backseater!

3682
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:02,820
To be fair, I'm not the one playing the game, so I don't remember.

3683
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:04,200
Oh my god.

3684
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:04,600
Okay.

3685
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:05,740
Go back in there.

3686
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:11,160
Yeah, I'm the one guy.

3687
02:08:11,420 --> 02:08:12,500
I really am.

3688
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:13,880
You're the one guy.

3689
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:15,640
I was testing Doki's.

3690
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:17,140
Oh, why are you...

3691
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:17,660
Why are you...

3692
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:19,020
Why are you going to that mirror, Doki?

3693
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:20,400
I hate you!

3694
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:22,740
Yeah, yeah.

3695
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:24,360
I'm the one...

3696
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,700
One of us.

3697
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:27,660
One of us.

3698
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:31,780
The longer we play, the more she regresses into the one guy.

3699
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:33,580
I'm becoming the one guy.

3700
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:35,680
I should probably pay attention more to this.

3701
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:40,440
Oh, it's the other one that has the crowbar.

3702
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:41,080
I remember.

3703
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:42,200
Where is this guy?

3704
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:43,840
Oh my god, he is risen!

3705
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:46,100
Oh my god, on the third day.

3706
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,880
Do you think he has the crowbar in him?

3707
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:52,680
It's gonna defile Christ to see if there is.

3708
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:55,780
Gonna stick my hand into his chest.

3709
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:56,840
Wow.

3710
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:58,060
Happy Easter, everybody.

3711
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:02,460
Oh, it's a...

3712
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:03,740
Oh, it's a butcher knife!

3713
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,820
I was like, what the fuck you meant by butcher knife?

3714
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,580
See, I told you I wasn't crazy.

3715
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:12,840
Oh my god.

3716
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,660
Oh look, there's an easter egg.

3717
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:16,360
Yeah, there's the easter egg.

3718
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,980
Get an easter egg!

3719
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:20,480
Oh my god, alright.

3720
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:22,780
Now where do I have to go with that butcher knife?

3721
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:24,200
I'm holding on.

3722
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:24,780
Where do I have to go?

3723
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:26,640
Where do we have to go?

3724
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:27,480
Okay.

3725
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:29,320
Yes.

3726
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:33,420
We have to go to...

3727
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:38,780
Okay, get the sledgehammer and we gotta go to the...

3728
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:40,120
second...

3729
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:41,360
Wait, hold on.

3730
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:41,740
What?

3731
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:42,840
Hold on.

3732
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,080
The second what?

3733
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:46,860
Yes, we gotta go to the second floor office.

3734
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,000
Oh!

3735
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,660
Daddy's office?

3736
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:55,300
Yeah, daddy's office.

3737
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,440
Okay, okay.

3738
02:09:57,140 --> 02:09:58,580
Time to daddy's office.

3739
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,140
Alright, time to go to papa's office.

3740
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:03,040
Papa!

3741
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:03,800
Papa!

3742
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:05,680
How would anyone solve this?

3743
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:06,400
I don't.

3744
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,180
I don't know.

3745
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:08,500
I don't know.

3746
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:12,720
Especially with like, when it went to grandma.

3747
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,620
Yeah, and limited resources.

3748
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,140
And limited resources.

3749
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:17,320
Oh my god.

3750
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:18,680
Second floor office.

3751
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:21,820
Okay.

3752
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:26,820
The knife, we needed it for this, for this, for the office.

3753
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,660
But, we'll get something that you might remember that we needed too.

3754
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:33,100
So, we'll be able to solve another puzzle.

3755
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,820
Well, we'll speed run these.

3756
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:36,740
Because we kind of already did some of these.

3757
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:39,340
So like, we could just speed run through some of them.

3758
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:40,760
Where'd you go?

3759
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:41,680
Doki?

3760
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:43,400
Don't give me a sec.

3761
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:45,520
I feel mentally prepared myself.

3762
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:51,260
Because I know Granny's gonna chase me when I have this stupid fucking hammer on me.

3763
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:53,600
Oh, yeah.

3764
02:10:54,460 --> 02:10:55,100
Um.

3765
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:56,620
Give me a sec.

3766
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:02,320
I'm just disassociating for five seconds before I'm back into this mortal plane of existence.

3767
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:05,180
I uh By Elie.

3768
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:06,800
Ey!

3769
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:07,360
Ey!

3770
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:08,280
Ey!

3771
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:08,900
Ey!

3772
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:09,280
Ey!

3773
02:11:09,940 --> 02:11:10,140
Ey!

3774
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,100
A little samurai.

3775
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:17,920
No, that's where you went in, remember?

3776
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:19,900
Yes, and that's how you get out.

3777
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:27,540
That's where you...

3778
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:29,680
Sorry, I'm the worst today.

3779
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:31,820
I'm the worst today.

3780
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:33,580
What do you mean?

3781
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,840
Do you know how to go in to go out?

3782
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:38,960
I'm really testing you.

3783
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:40,480
I just...

3784
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:43,120
Guys, don't blame me, okay?

3785
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:45,500
I'm on new meds, okay?

3786
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:48,880
It makes my brain foggy!

3787
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:53,440
All I can remember are the lyrics to Butterfly!

3788
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,520
Oh my god, she's coming back.

3789
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,160
It's fine, you're going through a hole.

3790
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:07,300
Oh my god.

3791
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:10,800
This is why I can't find any meds, she took them all.

3792
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:12,980
Me?

3793
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,660
She took them all.

3794
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:16,040
No, you definitely took them all.

3795
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:16,120
I'm on.

3796
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,160
Okie dokie.

3797
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:24,400
I-I-I-I-I-I.

3798
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,280
I-I-I-I-I.

3799
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,340
Ay-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.

3800
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,200
Ay-I-I-I-I-I.

3801
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:30,580
Ay-I-I-I-I-I.

3802
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:34,920
Ay-I-I-I-I-I-I-i...

3803
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,200
Alright.

3804
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:36,140
Second floor.

3805
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:57,840
Oh my god, there it is.

3806
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:05,100
She can't see you if you can't see her.

3807
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:07,300
Papa!

3808
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:11,020
Oh, there's the bag.

3809
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:14,420
Yeah, see, remember I said you'll find something that you will need.

3810
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:16,480
And then I'll stick it in him.

3811
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:18,000
Yeah, stick in the knife.

3812
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:20,520
It's like, you know, like the...

3813
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:20,700
Pop a pirate!

3814
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,780
Let's see if her head comes off!

3815
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,700
He's gonna spring to life!

3816
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:29,100
Yay!

3817
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:31,240
Pop that pirate!

3818
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:32,700
Pop a pirate!

3819
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:35,640
It's like monkeys in a barrel, too.

3820
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:41,960
Oh, there's the key!

3821
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:42,980
I love you!

3822
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,160
Oh, there it is!

3823
02:13:44,440 --> 02:13:46,580
What a great way to say it!

3824
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:48,880
Okay.

3825
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:50,100
Wait a second.

3826
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:51,480
Alright, I found a small key.

3827
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:53,620
I'm waiting.

3828
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,080
I don't need pills.

3829
02:13:57,220 --> 02:13:58,600
I'm reading the instructions.

3830
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:00,240
Yeah.

3831
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,680
I'm gonna throw this away.

3832
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:05,620
So I hope that I don't need it anymore.

3833
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:06,380
Okay.

3834
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:12,600
So the part after this was what we did where we followed the guy and he was like, led us to the room with the peepholes.

3835
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:14,300
What?

3836
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:15,060
What?

3837
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,340
So, remember the...

3838
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:18,280
So, we already did that part.

3839
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,040
Yeah.

3840
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:23,580
Remember we followed the guy and he led us like through the garage and everything and all around.

3841
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:25,780
So, then...

3842
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:29,180
We go to...

3843
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,080
We gotta give the...

3844
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:33,120
Remember the hospital?

3845
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:34,340
Area?

3846
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:35,520
Where is that?

3847
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:41,400
Remember when she was in the little hospital area?

3848
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:42,760
She was like a...

3849
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:43,780
She was like...

3850
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:43,980
She was like...

3851
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:44,880
Like a shadow?

3852
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:45,660
Yeah.

3853
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:46,220
Yeah.

3854
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:48,640
I don't remember where that was.

3855
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:49,240
Hold on though.

3856
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,400
Before we do that...

3857
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:52,880
Oh wait.

3858
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:53,440
No, never mind.

3859
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:54,180
Hold on.

3860
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,900
What the fuck is the shadow room?

3861
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:58,100
I'm trying to read!

3862
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:03,440
Oh, we gotta go to...

3863
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:05,900
The peephole room.

3864
02:15:06,160 --> 02:15:07,400
No, we gotta go to the...

3865
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:08,200
To the...

3866
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:09,720
Remember when she was shadowed?

3867
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:10,580
Remember?

3868
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:12,920
In the shadow realm?

3869
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:14,440
Peephole.

3870
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,840
Stop following the guide!

3871
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:19,400
We need to go to the shadow...

3872
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:20,500
I'm trying...

3873
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,400
It's not telling me where the shadow room is!

3874
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:24,360
It's stuck as a shadow grandma!

3875
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:31,540
Stop the peephole!

3876
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:39,020
Um...

3877
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:42,460
It's stuck as a shadow room!

3878
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,860
What thing?

3879
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:46,880
Where was it?

3880
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:48,000
I don't remember!

3881
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,520
I'm thinking!

3882
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:51,400
Uh...

3883
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:53,320
Uh...

3884
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:53,920
Uh...

3885
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:54,800
Peephole!

3886
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:00,400
It really isn't...

3887
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:00,600
Okay.

3888
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:01,640
Hold on.

3889
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,280
There will be...

3890
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:03,380
There will be...

3891
02:16:03,380 --> 02:16:04,180
Three paintings.

3892
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:04,940
Okay, it says...

3893
02:16:04,940 --> 02:16:05,340
Oh my god!

3894
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:06,940
We know that's the room!

3895
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:08,840
You read that mine!

3896
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:10,240
I'm giving this to you!

3897
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:11,200
You can read it!

3898
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:12,880
Because it's not telling me where to go!

3899
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:13,180
Yeah!

3900
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:14,300
You're giving it to me!

3901
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:15,980
I'm controlling the game!

3902
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,120
You're the navigator!

3903
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:23,490
You know like when you're driving a car up the map!

3904
02:16:25,090 --> 02:16:26,730
The TV room!

3905
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:27,790
Where the fuck is...

3906
02:16:27,790 --> 02:16:28,510
Oh my god!

3907
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:29,890
On the first floor!

3908
02:16:37,010 --> 02:16:39,690
I can't read if you're yelling at me!

3909
02:16:39,690 --> 02:16:49,940
I feel like we're like on a road trip right now!

3910
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:55,460
Trying to navigate to fucking the Niagara Falls or some fucking...

3911
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:57,480
We're driving to the Niagara Falls right now!

3912
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,640
And we're trying to bring out like...

3913
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:03,000
We should pull over and ask for directions and chat is our direction!

3914
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:08,340
Like we're pulling over on the side of the road to ask chat where to go!

3915
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:10,960
We could go back to the peephole!

3916
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:12,620
Okay!

3917
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:13,360
Go to the...

3918
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:15,220
Go to the TV room on the first floor!

3919
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:15,800
Okay!

3920
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:17,260
Okay!

3921
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:19,000
Okay!

3922
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:24,180
This is like keep talking and nobody explodes!

3923
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:26,120
But when... go!

3924
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:30,600
Okay!

3925
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:31,960
Alright!

3926
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:32,580
Play the game!

3927
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:34,560
I told you where to go!

3928
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:35,140
Okay!

3929
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:36,720
Give me a sec!

3930
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:37,120
Let me...

3931
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:39,340
Grab something sweet!

3932
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:40,940
I just thought the guide would give me a pick!

3933
02:17:40,940 --> 02:17:42,060
A picture would have turned it!

3934
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:47,160
Okay!

3935
02:17:48,720 --> 02:17:49,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3936
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

3937
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:50,920
Peephole!

3938
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:51,980
Are we there yet?

3939
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,580
That room, that room, that room!

3940
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:55,780
Straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead...

3941
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:55,880
Nope!

3942
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:56,360
Straight ahead!

3943
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:01,420
Okay, remember where the mirror is?

3944
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:02,440
Okay, there it is!

3945
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:03,580
Yeah!

3946
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:04,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3947
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:05,300
It's a peepo.

3948
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:06,640
Peepo!

3949
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:11,140
Actually, I really just want her to say peepo.

3950
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:18,120
Alright, we're gonna give Granny her baggie back.

3951
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:20,680
Her little grab bag.

3952
02:18:24,660 --> 02:18:25,300
Granny!

3953
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:28,140
Granny, we got it for you.

3954
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:29,820
We got the insulin bag.

3955
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:31,540
Is it insulin?

3956
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:32,360
Infusion.

3957
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:34,320
Oh my god.

3958
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:35,320
She has diabetes.

3959
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:36,740
She reduced to atoms.

3960
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,620
A sun toy.

3961
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:40,680
Peepo.

3962
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:45,980
That's the peepo.

3963
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:46,360
Oh!

3964
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:51,040
Remember that one baby thing was missing the little toys.

3965
02:18:51,980 --> 02:18:52,740
Yeah.

3966
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:55,340
Alright, now we're going to the wardrobe in the basement.

3967
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:00,520
There's some wardrobe in the basement.

3968
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:01,820
Mirror 5.

3969
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:05,240
Where's the... Someone said I didn't get the cloud toy.

3970
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:06,420
Where's the cloud toy?

3971
02:19:07,220 --> 02:19:08,320
Wait, what's the cloud toy?

3972
02:19:08,560 --> 02:19:11,620
Is it that what... Is it in the... Where we... Oh my god.

3973
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:12,280
Grandma!

3974
02:19:16,770 --> 02:19:19,070
Just go into... Yeah, Papa's room.

3975
02:19:21,050 --> 02:19:22,290
Wait, can she get us in here?

3976
02:19:22,290 --> 02:19:24,350
No, apparently she can't go into mirrors.

3977
02:19:25,090 --> 02:19:26,790
Haha, stupid Dolores.

3978
02:19:27,050 --> 02:19:27,650
Stupid Dolores.

3979
02:19:27,890 --> 02:19:28,050
Stupid Dolores.

3980
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:28,790
Where is she?

3981
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:29,510
Where is she?

3982
02:19:31,190 --> 02:19:32,350
I think she's gone.

3983
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:35,390
They told me like, I forgot something in this room.

3984
02:19:35,650 --> 02:19:37,610
But clearly I... Oh my god, they lied.

3985
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:39,170
Uh, hold on.

3986
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:39,850
They fucking lied.

3987
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:41,930
Uh, hold on, I'm looking.

3988
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:43,230
They fucking lied.

3989
02:19:44,130 --> 02:19:44,590
Cloud...

3990
02:19:45,330 --> 02:19:45,790
Toy...

3991
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:46,070
Oh!

3992
02:19:46,410 --> 02:19:48,610
Interact with the box on the...

3993
02:19:48,610 --> 02:19:49,210
Desk.

3994
02:19:49,290 --> 02:19:52,150
To pick up an audio cassette and a cloud mobile toy.

3995
02:19:52,390 --> 02:19:53,210
Wait, where are we going?

3996
02:19:53,430 --> 02:19:53,790
What is this?

3997
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:53,910
I don't know.

3998
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:55,130
Where is this?

3999
02:19:55,810 --> 02:19:57,830
How did you... How did you find this?

4000
02:19:57,870 --> 02:19:58,370
What is this?

4001
02:19:59,470 --> 02:20:01,670
I don't even know anymore.

4002
02:20:02,350 --> 02:20:03,290
Wait, where are we?

4003
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:05,130
I don't know.

4004
02:20:05,470 --> 02:20:06,310
Where am I?

4005
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:09,150
What is this?

4006
02:20:10,790 --> 02:20:11,470
What happened?

4007
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:12,770
I looked away for two seconds.

4008
02:20:12,890 --> 02:20:13,330
There we go.

4009
02:20:13,470 --> 02:20:14,390
There's the cloud.

4010
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:18,540
What's in there?

4011
02:20:19,140 --> 02:20:20,700
Are those a bunch of IV bags?

4012
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:22,020
So we could've just grabbed one of these?

4013
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,480
Yeah, we could've just grabbed one of these.

4014
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:24,180
It's jammed.

4015
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:24,480
Okay.

4016
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,860
Oh my god.

4017
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:28,020
That's it?

4018
02:20:29,020 --> 02:20:30,080
Yep, that's it.

4019
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:31,360
Oh!

4020
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:33,440
Oh wait, no, he's friendly.

4021
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:35,120
I don't think so.

4022
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:38,300
I don't think so.

4023
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:40,200
I don't think so.

4024
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:52,500
I just don't know.

4025
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:54,200
I just saw you wanted to say hi.

4026
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,220
I don't know.

4027
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:56,060
I just...

4028
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:00,280
What did I do?

4029
02:21:00,660 --> 02:21:01,220
What did I do?

4030
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:01,480
What did I do?

4031
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:04,260
I just...

4032
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:05,560
I just...

4033
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:06,640
I...

4034
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:07,840
The...

4035
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:11,080
The latest auto save, I guess.

4036
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:16,720
Oh my god.

4037
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:20,680
Oh!

4038
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:24,200
Um, it says, leave the room to find George standing.

4039
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:28,660
From here, re-enter the room and slowly shut the door when he starts to walk towards you.

4040
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:33,640
It's just be like, nope.

4041
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:35,400
Yeah, pretty much.

4042
02:21:35,980 --> 02:21:38,240
Just literally deny him any access.

4043
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,660
Just close the door.

4044
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:44,300
And he just gave you a British hello.

4045
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,260
I have to

4046
02:21:54,220 --> 02:21:54,720
do...

4047
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:57,980
I didn't realize I had to do this all over again.

4048
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:01,880
Why didn't I auto-save when you grabbed the cloud?

4049
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:03,700
I know, that's what I was thinking!

4050
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,020
What the hell?

4051
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:09,900
Oh my god.

4052
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:12,960
I can't believe it.

4053
02:22:13,580 --> 02:22:14,360
Where was that again?

4054
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:15,520
Oh yeah, we were running away from...

4055
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:15,960
It's on the second floor.

4056
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:16,440
Yeah.

4057
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:18,220
We were running away from Grandma.

4058
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:20,120
She's being like...

4059
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,680
Booga, booga, booga, booga, I need my meds.

4060
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:22,860
She's about to show up, right?

4061
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:23,640
Grandma?

4062
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:24,520
No?

4063
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:25,320
Grandma?

4064
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:26,640
Grandma?

4065
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:27,280
Maybe not.

4066
02:22:28,580 --> 02:22:29,300
Okay, so...

4067
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:31,360
We're gonna let this guy walk towards us.

4068
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:32,540
But we're gonna...

4069
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:33,980
I didn't even notice this was a door.

4070
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:37,640
I only noticed because it was like slanted over there.

4071
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:40,340
And then like people in my chat...

4072
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:42,800
Like, you know, when I pulled over for directions in the car...

4073
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:44,660
They were like, you should go back to the room.

4074
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:45,640
And I was like, okay.

4075
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,140
Oh, I...

4076
02:22:47,140 --> 02:22:48,380
You know, I...

4077
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:50,180
It was so dark I couldn't see.

4078
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:51,720
Why didn't you do anything, huh?

4079
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:54,600
It was just so dark I couldn't see.

4080
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:55,640
Okay, quick save now.

4081
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:57,420
I don't think it lets me.

4082
02:22:58,540 --> 02:22:58,940
Yeah.

4083
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:00,820
This is so messed up.

4084
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:01,880
I have to...

4085
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:08,340
Okay, now shut the door when he comes at you.

4086
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:13,700
Oh, shut the door!

4087
02:23:13,980 --> 02:23:14,620
Shut the door!

4088
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:20,460
Get me!

4089
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:26,120
I think we're good.

4090
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:27,660
Are we though?

4091
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:28,080
Oh god.

4092
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:29,420
I don't know, I hope so!

4093
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:31,720
What if he's right there?

4094
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:39,940
He's around the corner!

4095
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:44,200
Cut.

4096
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:54,020
Okay, now that's...

4097
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:54,860
We gotta go to the basement.

4098
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:09,660
You remember how to get to the basement?

4099
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:10,120
No.

4100
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:13,080
Well, who's speaking gibberish?

4101
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:14,420
It's the grandma.

4102
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:14,980
Yeah, down here.

4103
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:17,660
It's always here.

4104
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,860
It's always here.

4105
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:23,140
She's always there watching me.

4106
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:25,820
What's the wardrobe in the basement?

4107
02:24:27,740 --> 02:24:28,460
What the fuck?

4108
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:29,720
That's where Jesus was.

4109
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:33,000
That's the Jesus level.

4110
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,460
I swear to god.

4111
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,140
You bring me back to the fucking Easter egg.

4112
02:24:36,260 --> 02:24:37,280
I swear to fucking god.

4113
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,320
No, we gotta do...

4114
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:39,880
We gotta give Dolores her tea.

4115
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:40,800
What?

4116
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:43,540
Yeah, we haven't found this one yet.

4117
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:47,200
No, that was the closet, no?

4118
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:50,980
I don't know what the...

4119
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:51,940
Can you quicksave here?

4120
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,020
Oh my god.

4121
02:24:56,680 --> 02:24:58,480
The one near the mannequin.

4122
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,260
The one near the mannequin, Doki.

4123
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:02,600
Do I have...

4124
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:04,640
If I unlocked it, though?

4125
02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:05,940
I don't know.

4126
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:07,280
So go to the mannequin.

4127
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:09,060
Oh, oh!

4128
02:25:09,260 --> 02:25:10,180
I saved, wow.

4129
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:12,280
Wow.

4130
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:15,840
No.

4131
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:16,920
Oh, mannequin.

4132
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:17,740
Yeah.

4133
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:21,000
Is it the one up there?

4134
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:21,460
Or no?

4135
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,760
Did we get one over here?

4136
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:24,840
Oh, that says the wardrobe.

4137
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:25,200
Right there.

4138
02:25:25,380 --> 02:25:26,540
Maybe it's inside the wardrobe.

4139
02:25:26,600 --> 02:25:27,040
I need a mirror.

4140
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:27,600
I need...

4141
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:28,680
I know there's a hammer.

4142
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:29,900
I need to grab the hammer.

4143
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,080
I need to grab the fucking hammer.

4144
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:34,920
Uh...

4145
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:36,840
It says next to the wardrobe.

4146
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:40,680
It's right there.

4147
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:41,280
I saw it.

4148
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:41,880
I saw it.

4149
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:42,220
Oh, you did?

4150
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,760
I saw it.

4151
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:45,140
You saw it?

4152
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:46,420
It's right here.

4153
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:47,260
Oh!

4154
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,280
Smash!

4155
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:50,900
Hello, Granny.

4156
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,200
What took you so long, George?

4157
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:54,360
Tea.

4158
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:55,720
Okay.

4159
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:56,840
Where is tea?

4160
02:25:57,440 --> 02:25:57,860
Oh my god.

4161
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:58,180
Hey, look.

4162
02:25:58,300 --> 02:25:59,180
There's another...

4163
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:02,280
Oh my god.

4164
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:03,160
What's she talking about?

4165
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:04,660
Oh, there's a cassette tape.

4166
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:08,900
I'm beginning to make you love your work more than me.

4167
02:26:10,740 --> 02:26:11,640
She's just yapping.

4168
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:12,420
Use the sledgehammer.

4169
02:26:14,720 --> 02:26:17,000
I want to be able to see what the...

4170
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:17,840
Oh my god.

4171
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:19,080
And I can't light it up.

4172
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:20,180
This is all your fault.

4173
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:22,420
My fault!

4174
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:24,280
This is all your fault.

4175
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:26,020
Would you be a doll?

4176
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:28,180
You've actually some of my specialties.

4177
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:29,680
You know where you are.

4178
02:26:29,820 --> 02:26:30,500
I can't get here.

4179
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:32,680
I can't get here.

4180
02:26:33,180 --> 02:26:34,640
She won't let me get here.

4181
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:35,640
You...

4182
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:37,160
Where's the tea box?

4183
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:39,200
Okay, so the tea...

4184
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:39,660
Hold on!

4185
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:40,680
You heard her.

4186
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,180
She said she needs her tea.

4187
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:43,700
It's up in the attic.

4188
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:50,280
Okay.

4189
02:26:53,020 --> 02:26:54,500
Save soon, Dwyane.

4190
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:56,480
The door to...

4191
02:26:56,480 --> 02:26:57,740
Or the hole is right there.

4192
02:26:58,740 --> 02:26:59,940
Into the hole I go.

4193
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:02,600
Do I need my sledgehammer?

4194
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:03,020
I don't remember for it.

4195
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:13,200
I'm dropping this.

4196
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:14,120
I'm dropping this.

4197
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:17,740
If I don't need this, I'm gonna drop this hammer right about now.

4198
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:21,080
It's...

4199
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:22,660
I think you'll be okay, actually.

4200
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:25,420
Why is...

4201
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:25,560
Oh, wait.

4202
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:26,720
Yeah, you might be okay.

4203
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:28,100
Because you already broke the mirror, you know?

4204
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:29,560
I don't remember.

4205
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:30,660
I...

4206
02:27:30,660 --> 02:27:32,240
I don't remember.

4207
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:34,840
I don't remember.

4208
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:35,460
Just keep it.

4209
02:27:35,580 --> 02:27:36,220
Just hold on to it.

4210
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:36,560
It's fine.

4211
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:38,560
Okay.

4212
02:27:39,360 --> 02:27:39,980
Okay, nice.

4213
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:43,300
Alright, time to go upstairs, baby.

4214
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:46,260
Honk!

4215
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:48,360
Honk!

4216
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:50,600
Honk!

4217
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:51,420
Honk!

4218
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:53,040
Who's speaking gibberish?

4219
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:55,020
I don't care anymore.

4220
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:57,260
You remember where the...

4221
02:27:57,260 --> 02:27:58,080
Attic is?

4222
02:27:58,320 --> 02:27:59,800
Uh, do you remember how to turn on the light?

4223
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:00,640
No.

4224
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:03,980
I think you can drop the sledgehammer.

4225
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:04,620
I'll be honest.

4226
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:08,020
Is it here or is it here?

4227
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:10,180
Uh, it's behind...

4228
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:10,700
Uh, yeah.

4229
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:12,160
Up there.

4230
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:12,580
Right there.

4231
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,060
Then you use that thing.

4232
02:28:16,300 --> 02:28:16,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4233
02:28:18,900 --> 02:28:19,300
Alright.

4234
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:21,320
Alright!

4235
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:22,220
Okay.

4236
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:25,020
Alright.

4237
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:27,620
This chapter is less scary and more like...

4238
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:29,560
I just want to put granny in a home.

4239
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:31,420
Yeah, pretty much.

4240
02:28:33,020 --> 02:28:34,260
What the hell is that?

4241
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,580
That pisses me off.

4242
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:39,680
That's what I was thinking, too.

4243
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:41,820
There it is.

4244
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:44,200
Sun and tea.

4245
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:46,360
Okay.

4246
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:48,200
Alright, we got some special tea.

4247
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:49,400
Oh, wait.

4248
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:50,020
Hold on, hold on.

4249
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:50,740
Hold on.

4250
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:51,440
What?

4251
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:53,020
Uh...

4252
02:28:53,020 --> 02:28:54,080
Bring the tea.

4253
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:54,620
Okay, yeah.

4254
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,500
You can bring it back to her.

4255
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:55,980
Okay.

4256
02:28:56,920 --> 02:28:57,720
I'll pause my game.

4257
02:28:58,120 --> 02:28:59,440
I need to blow my nose.

4258
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:00,180
Okay.

4259
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:00,760
Give me a sec.

4260
02:29:11,010 --> 02:29:12,050
But what makes...

4261
02:29:12,050 --> 02:29:12,390
We're on mirror?

4262
02:29:12,970 --> 02:29:14,090
What makes the tea so...

4263
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:16,310
There was no way we could do this without the guide.

4264
02:29:16,470 --> 02:29:16,630
I...

4265
02:29:16,630 --> 02:29:17,990
I feel like...

4266
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:18,150
No.

4267
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:19,890
There was no way.

4268
02:29:20,050 --> 02:29:20,270
I...

4269
02:29:20,270 --> 02:29:22,190
I'm so fucking done with this.

4270
02:29:22,310 --> 02:29:22,510
No.

4271
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:24,870
I'm glad I looked it up.

4272
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:38,110
Even when we stopped our car to ask chat for directions, it was...

4273
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:45,090
I don't think even, like, anybody else would be able to describe each step that you have to do.

4274
02:29:45,270 --> 02:29:45,990
Like, it's insane.

4275
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:47,350
There's so...

4276
02:29:47,350 --> 02:29:48,070
I don't know.

4277
02:29:48,070 --> 02:29:49,710
There's so much to this.

4278
02:29:49,710 --> 02:29:50,910
There's no direction.

4279
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:54,550
Oh, my God.

4280
02:29:55,430 --> 02:29:55,910
Okay.

4281
02:29:56,230 --> 02:29:57,730
We go to Dolores, right?

4282
02:29:58,630 --> 02:29:58,870
Yep.

4283
02:29:59,310 --> 02:29:59,870
Where was her?

4284
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:00,290
Back to Dolores.

4285
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:01,210
In the basement.

4286
02:30:03,010 --> 02:30:03,490
Okay.

4287
02:30:03,550 --> 02:30:04,430
The mannequin room.

4288
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:05,450
Yeah, yeah.

4289
02:30:05,490 --> 02:30:06,110
The mannequin room.

4290
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:06,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4291
02:30:07,390 --> 02:30:07,770
Okay.

4292
02:30:08,690 --> 02:30:10,230
First off, I want to go here.

4293
02:30:11,690 --> 02:30:13,210
Oh, grab that.

4294
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:14,890
Can you...

4295
02:30:14,890 --> 02:30:15,650
Wait, you can't grab it.

4296
02:30:15,790 --> 02:30:16,390
Okay, never mind.

4297
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:17,890
I can't, but I can put this away.

4298
02:30:18,410 --> 02:30:18,830
Mm-hmm.

4299
02:30:19,750 --> 02:30:20,030
Okay.

4300
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:23,770
We just need three...

4301
02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,550
What?

4302
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:30,810
Okay.

4303
02:30:32,170 --> 02:30:32,730
Now...

4304
02:30:32,730 --> 02:30:35,550
Now I listen to my...

4305
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:37,490
There's so...

4306
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:39,830
The honking...

4307
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:41,790
Oh, my God.

4308
02:30:43,130 --> 02:30:45,130
Let me just listen to this, Lord.

4309
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:50,430
I listened to this already.

4310
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:52,710
I lost track of all the tapes I have.

4311
02:30:57,850 --> 02:30:58,830
I don't think so.

4312
02:30:59,150 --> 02:31:00,110
We only listened to one.

4313
02:31:00,690 --> 02:31:01,750
I don't remember which one we listened to.

4314
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:02,970
They all look the same to me.

4315
02:31:03,930 --> 02:31:05,130
I'm going to be late for tea.

4316
02:31:08,270 --> 02:31:10,250
Oh, this tells us where the tea was.

4317
02:31:10,410 --> 02:31:13,010
Oh, we should have been listening to this this entire time.

4318
02:31:14,290 --> 02:31:16,790
This literally tells us how to progress the game.

4319
02:31:23,170 --> 02:31:26,970
This was our guide.

4320
02:31:26,970 --> 02:31:30,110
They don't really explain that that's why you have to...

4321
02:31:30,110 --> 02:31:32,790
You have to keep coming here to figure out how to progress.

4322
02:31:33,330 --> 02:31:34,810
I guess so.

4323
02:31:34,810 --> 02:31:39,010
She sometimes forgets where she is or even the fact that... This was our guide.

4324
02:31:39,610 --> 02:31:42,810
They literally recorded in a guide for us.

4325
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:51,470
The gibberish.

4326
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:52,430
Oh, that's her.

4327
02:31:57,630 --> 02:31:58,750
Come on, engage!

4328
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:03,130
Oh, she has dementia.

4329
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:07,850
That's rough, buddy.

4330
02:32:09,070 --> 02:32:10,050
That's really rough.

4331
02:32:10,210 --> 02:32:12,090
Look, this is your favorite people room.

4332
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:12,950
People!

4333
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:14,150
Uh-oh.

4334
02:32:21,070 --> 02:32:22,210
Not today, grandma.

4335
02:32:23,570 --> 02:32:24,310
Not today.

4336
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:33,130
Okay, don't she suck?

4337
02:32:33,130 --> 02:32:34,410
I don't think she's gonna chase you.

4338
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:36,010
She's not there.

4339
02:32:38,290 --> 02:32:38,890
Oh,

4340
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:43,530
why is she like this?

4341
02:32:45,910 --> 02:32:47,770
Like, why is she like this?

4342
02:32:47,790 --> 02:32:48,910
It might just be...

4343
02:32:49,650 --> 02:32:51,250
It might just be a...

4344
02:32:51,250 --> 02:32:52,610
A thing.

4345
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:53,470
Like a...

4346
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:54,670
A little...

4347
02:32:54,670 --> 02:32:55,070
Spook...

4348
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:55,990
A spooky moment.

4349
02:32:56,290 --> 02:32:57,450
Oh my god.

4350
02:32:57,450 --> 02:33:00,050
Why is she like this though?

4351
02:33:04,670 --> 02:33:06,910
I don't think she will.

4352
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:08,150
That's not fair.

4353
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:10,390
Look through the people.

4354
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:13,130
Not gonna look through you stupid people!

4355
02:33:13,550 --> 02:33:16,330
And we can finish that mission!

4356
02:33:16,850 --> 02:33:18,410
We don't need them!

4357
02:33:18,950 --> 02:33:20,790
Wait, she opened the door herself.

4358
02:33:21,230 --> 02:33:21,970
Wait, that's legal.

4359
02:33:21,970 --> 02:33:22,050
I don't need you.

4360
02:33:24,970 --> 02:33:25,730
Okay, we need...

4361
02:33:25,730 --> 02:33:26,530
We need to go again.

4362
02:33:26,690 --> 02:33:28,130
We need to go to...

4363
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:29,310
The basement.

4364
02:33:29,530 --> 02:33:30,170
The basement, okay.

4365
02:33:30,270 --> 02:33:31,570
So you gotta go down the stairs.

4366
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:32,750
Fucking hell.

4367
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:37,460
Oh see, I told you.

4368
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:39,740
It was just a...

4369
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:41,580
It was just a thing.

4370
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:44,580
Hunk.

4371
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:45,420
Hunk.

4372
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:46,280
Hunk.

4373
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:47,020
Hunk.

4374
02:33:47,660 --> 02:33:50,180
At least there's always one constant in this.

4375
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:52,800
And it's the fact that the car alarm is still going.

4376
02:33:55,300 --> 02:33:56,020
Alright.

4377
02:33:56,900 --> 02:33:58,360
Back to the staircase.

4378
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:01,000
The wheeling staircase.

4379
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:02,900
That's not what this is.

4380
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:04,760
Weeeeee...

4381
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:05,640
I love you!

4382
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:33,300
I don't remember how to get there.

4383
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,660
Mannequin, mannequin.

4384
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,020
Yes, but how do we get there?

4385
02:34:37,240 --> 02:34:37,720
Turn...

4386
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:39,380
Well, yeah, you can go there.

4387
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:40,620
And then to the left.

4388
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:41,800
There it is.

4389
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,780
Down the stairs, yep.

4390
02:34:44,780 --> 02:34:46,480
I can be useful sometimes.

4391
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:50,040
Oh my god, finally the one guy that said the right thing.

4392
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:52,820
Okay.

4393
02:34:53,620 --> 02:34:54,920
Wait, she's not even here.

4394
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:57,680
She's not even here, this ungrateful bitch.

4395
02:34:57,940 --> 02:34:58,160
I know.

4396
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:00,920
Contains hot water.

4397
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:03,460
Do you need both hands to grab the tea?

4398
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:04,200
We have one?

4399
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:05,660
Oh my god!

4400
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:08,580
What do we have point setting?

4401
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:10,580
I've been the light!

4402
02:35:11,060 --> 02:35:12,540
I've been a cutscene!

4403
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:18,480
I can't just leave the fucking cutscene!

4404
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:28,720
Oh my god.

4405
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:40,920
That's what we tried to do to her and she got really upset about it.

4406
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:42,180
You know what?

4407
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:43,620
Maybe deserved on our part.

4408
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:44,520
Maybe deserved on our part.

4409
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:46,020
I told you to put it home!

4410
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:46,540
Oh my god!

4411
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:50,240
Where are we?

4412
02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:51,920
We're now in Half-Life.

4413
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:53,460
Oh,

4414
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:57,680
we're in the people room.

4415
02:35:58,360 --> 02:35:58,980
Where are we?

4416
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:01,500
Wait, how did the ghost hit me?

4417
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,460
Ghost can't...

4418
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:03,060
Wait, what?

4419
02:36:03,980 --> 02:36:04,500
What?

4420
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:05,740
Are we in the oven?

4421
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:07,720
We're in the oven!

4422
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:09,420
How did she put us in here?

4423
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:10,840
How did she put us in here?

4424
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:15,040
How did she put us in here?

4425
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:15,880
Yeah.

4426
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:17,360
How did you lock the oven?

4427
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:19,500
How did the ghost lock me in an oven?

4428
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:22,560
Uh-oh.

4429
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:23,320
Uh-oh.

4430
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:25,060
Yeah, how big is this oven?

4431
02:36:25,220 --> 02:36:25,660
Am I...

4432
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:27,040
Okay, I was gonna say...

4433
02:36:27,700 --> 02:36:28,520
I was like...

4434
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:30,820
Is this like Resident Evil where I'm supposed to look around?

4435
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:33,440
We're fine.

4436
02:36:33,460 --> 02:36:35,200
How the fuck did I fit in there?

4437
02:36:35,320 --> 02:36:37,220
I thought I was a grown-ass man!

4438
02:36:38,060 --> 02:36:39,520
World's smallest man.

4439
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:44,480
Yeah, I'm five foot eight.

4440
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:50,700
Alright, and we got the little star.

4441
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:51,440
That was cute.

4442
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:52,780
That was a cute star.

4443
02:36:53,060 --> 02:36:53,560
Almost being...

4444
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:54,120
Okay!

4445
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:56,120
...forget that there's murderers out here.

4446
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:57,700
Nice!

4447
02:36:57,980 --> 02:36:59,180
Now we can...

4448
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:00,360
Get out of here.

4449
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:02,800
And we can go to that one...

4450
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:03,220
That had the...

4451
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:03,900
Are you serious?

4452
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:04,900
I have the whole...

4453
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:05,540
Oh my god.

4454
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,980
Yeah, you need both hands for it too.

4455
02:37:08,400 --> 02:37:09,500
Are you fucking kidding me?

4456
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:11,640
Are you fucking...

4457
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:11,940
Okay.

4458
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:13,140
Okay.

4459
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:14,880
Okay.

4460
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:15,440
Yeah, you know where to go.

4461
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:17,920
It's been 20 years.

4462
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:19,160
Where is the window?

4463
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:20,800
Okay, the one...

4464
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:22,000
I'm almost positive.

4465
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,700
It's the one that I thought...

4466
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:25,940
Remember how I was like, Why are you running past it?

4467
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:27,580
I'm almost positive it's that one.

4468
02:37:28,080 --> 02:37:28,380
Oh no!

4469
02:37:28,980 --> 02:37:29,320
Yeah.

4470
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:30,180
Wait.

4471
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:31,420
No.

4472
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:32,640
It's the one...

4473
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:33,020
No, yeah.

4474
02:37:33,020 --> 02:37:33,860
Let me pause the game.

4475
02:37:34,300 --> 02:37:34,880
Let me pause the game.

4476
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:36,420
It's that one!

4477
02:37:36,700 --> 02:37:37,600
And then the one...

4478
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:40,860
The one by the stairs is the playground.

4479
02:37:41,460 --> 02:37:42,040
This is the...

4480
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:42,780
This is the one.

4481
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:44,100
Which one?

4482
02:37:44,100 --> 02:37:44,640
I have it.

4483
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:46,580
You said I ran past...

4484
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:48,700
I ran past 20 mirrors.

4485
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:50,340
Which mirror?

4486
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:51,260
Okay.

4487
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:52,360
Remember...

4488
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:53,720
She was chasing you.

4489
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:58,000
And I was like, We gotta get to the place with the crank.

4490
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:00,640
And I was like, Why are you running past it?

4491
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:02,300
That's the wardrobe.

4492
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:03,400
That's the wardrobe.

4493
02:38:03,580 --> 02:38:04,180
It's not...

4494
02:38:04,180 --> 02:38:05,020
No, no, no, no.

4495
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:06,200
We are in the wardrobe.

4496
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:07,080
We are...

4497
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:08,460
We are in the wardrobe.

4498
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:09,600
We are in the wardrobe.

4499
02:38:10,140 --> 02:38:11,380
This is the wardrobe mirror.

4500
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:12,660
What you need to know is...

4501
02:38:12,660 --> 02:38:14,340
go back to the basement TV room.

4502
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:18,620
Remember where the electrical...

4503
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:19,080
Key...

4504
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:19,800
Door is...

4505
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:21,140
It's right next to that.

4506
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:21,900
No!

4507
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:23,100
That door is locked.

4508
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:24,420
What?

4509
02:38:25,180 --> 02:38:25,660
No!

4510
02:38:25,980 --> 02:38:26,100
What?

4511
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:26,400
Yes!

4512
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:27,520
What?

4513
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:29,600
Yes, that door is locked!

4514
02:38:30,940 --> 02:38:32,760
The electric door.

4515
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,860
The electrical room door.

4516
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:40,780
The mirror next to... Leave this room.

4517
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:43,340
You know how to get back to the TV.

4518
02:38:43,700 --> 02:38:44,180
Yes.

4519
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:46,060
Okay, get back to the TV.

4520
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:48,880
But the basement TV, not the upstairs TV.

4521
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:50,320
Yes.

4522
02:38:52,060 --> 02:38:52,760
Okay.

4523
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:54,300
Alright.

4524
02:38:54,760 --> 02:38:55,380
It's here.

4525
02:38:55,760 --> 02:38:56,500
Yeah, yeah.

4526
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:59,660
Go all the way down to the end and then to the right.

4527
02:39:00,260 --> 02:39:01,360
That one right there.

4528
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:02,640
That door is locked.

4529
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:04,280
Was that not locked?

4530
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:06,220
Was it not this one?

4531
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:06,700
Was it not this one?

4532
02:39:07,260 --> 02:39:08,120
I told you.

4533
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:08,500
I know.

4534
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:09,140
I knew it.

4535
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:11,380
I fucking knew it.

4536
02:39:13,640 --> 02:39:14,840
I have no idea then.

4537
02:39:19,870 --> 02:39:21,110
I don't know where it is.

4538
02:39:24,370 --> 02:39:26,570
A near basement bathroom.

4539
02:39:27,230 --> 02:39:28,010
Where's that?

4540
02:39:28,350 --> 02:39:29,650
Well, I know where the bathroom is.

4541
02:39:30,470 --> 02:39:30,990
Base...

4542
02:39:30,990 --> 02:39:31,910
There's a...

4543
02:39:31,910 --> 02:39:32,150
Oh!

4544
02:39:32,630 --> 02:39:33,650
I know where it is.

4545
02:39:34,150 --> 02:39:34,370
Okay.

4546
02:39:34,450 --> 02:39:36,530
Go back to the one by the wardrobe.

4547
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,220
I told you!

4548
02:39:47,230 --> 02:39:47,930
The locked one!

4549
02:39:48,130 --> 02:39:48,890
What do you mean?

4550
02:39:49,250 --> 02:39:52,210
I thought you meant the outside door was locked.

4551
02:40:00,260 --> 02:40:01,040
I'm so locked.

4552
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:01,840
Is it the one right here?

4553
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:02,720
Oh, turn around.

4554
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:03,340
Turn around.

4555
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:03,740
Turn around.

4556
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:04,100
Turn around.

4557
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:04,600
Right there.

4558
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:06,000
Try that one.

4559
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:08,960
I was next to this one too!

4560
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:11,740
I was next to this one!

4561
02:40:11,740 --> 02:40:14,020
I forgot this one existed!

4562
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:18,960
Who gave you the fucking GPS?

4563
02:40:19,060 --> 02:40:21,940
Okay, to be fair, all it says is basement hallway.

4564
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:24,060
How the hell am I supposed to know what that means?

4565
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:27,000
It's also been 20 years for me!

4566
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:35,560
Your entire job was to navigate!

4567
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,020
How do you screw it up?

4568
02:40:38,220 --> 02:40:40,100
It just says basement hallway!

4569
02:40:40,100 --> 02:40:41,060
Oh my god!

4570
02:40:41,360 --> 02:40:43,180
In front of your face!

4571
02:40:43,640 --> 02:40:46,340
It says basement hallway and that's it!

4572
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:49,460
It's a damn compass.

4573
02:40:49,980 --> 02:40:52,660
And now we go to the park.

4574
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:55,300
I trust you know where that is.

4575
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:57,220
Why do you trust me?

4576
02:40:57,400 --> 02:41:00,680
I have not been remembering where anything is!

4577
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:02,280
What do you mean?

4578
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:03,640
Okay, remember!

4579
02:41:04,060 --> 02:41:05,540
No, I don't remember!

4580
02:41:05,860 --> 02:41:07,260
Let me speak!

4581
02:41:07,260 --> 02:41:07,640
No!

4582
02:41:08,100 --> 02:41:09,840
I actually know where this one is!

4583
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:11,640
I actually know where this one is!

4584
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:16,720
Okay.

4585
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:17,860
Um...

4586
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:19,200
So, it's...

4587
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:19,580
It's...

4588
02:41:19,580 --> 02:41:21,180
You go through the little...

4589
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:21,680
In the basement.

4590
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:23,160
You go through the windy hallway.

4591
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:23,840
Yes.

4592
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:25,040
And that leads you upstairs.

4593
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:26,720
That's like to the kitchen.

4594
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:34,260
What?

4595
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:35,920
Yeah, yeah.

4596
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,160
What?

4597
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:43,520
Yeah, yeah.

4598
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:47,600
Yeah, you go through...

4599
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:48,140
Okay, keep...

4600
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:48,500
Go straight.

4601
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:51,240
Or you could go downstairs.

4602
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:51,800
Or...

4603
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:53,120
I don't actually know how to get there.

4604
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:53,320
Here?

4605
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:53,740
Through here?

4606
02:41:53,980 --> 02:41:54,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4607
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:55,180
Remember?

4608
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:55,800
No!

4609
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:56,520
And then you go...

4610
02:41:58,120 --> 02:41:58,720
Straight!

4611
02:42:01,300 --> 02:42:01,600
Straight!

4612
02:42:02,180 --> 02:42:02,720
This way!

4613
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:03,880
Oh my god, okay.

4614
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:04,760
This one!

4615
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:07,560
I'm going crazier and crazier right now.

4616
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:09,020
I...

4617
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:10,060
My...

4618
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:11,460
My brain...

4619
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:11,680
So now...

4620
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:15,420
The compass will let you go through Silent Hill.

4621
02:42:17,260 --> 02:42:17,820
Okay...

4622
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:19,880
Okay...

4623
02:42:19,880 --> 02:42:20,140
Okay...

4624
02:42:20,140 --> 02:42:21,080
Where are you going?

4625
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,140
Go to Silent Hill.

4626
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,940
I'm looking at the compass!

4627
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:27,760
I'm just telling you to go outside the walls!

4628
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:32,080
I'm just...

4629
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:36,560
I'm just trying to follow the goddamn compass!

4630
02:42:36,760 --> 02:42:37,660
Yeah, go that way.

4631
02:42:37,820 --> 02:42:38,180
I guess.

4632
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:38,620
I don't know.

4633
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:39,440
Go somewhere.

4634
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:42,360
Alright, welcome to Silent Hill.

4635
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:43,600
The...

4636
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:43,960
Spring!

4637
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:45,320
Spring!

4638
02:42:50,860 --> 02:42:51,580
Alright.

4639
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,380
Uh, we're leaving, we're leaving the place.

4640
02:42:56,060 --> 02:42:57,500
We're finally out of here.

4641
02:42:57,980 --> 02:42:58,920
Oh my god.

4642
02:42:59,140 --> 02:42:59,700
Freedom!

4643
02:43:00,620 --> 02:43:01,040
Freedom!

4644
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:02,180
Freedom!

4645
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:06,600
Why are you hugging the wall like something's gonna...

4646
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:09,900
Nothing can come up to my right side.

4647
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:16,880
Alright, now there's gonna be an open grave.

4648
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,140
Oh wait, it closed the door on me.

4649
02:43:18,140 --> 02:43:19,240
It closed on you.

4650
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:20,360
Yeah.

4651
02:43:24,300 --> 02:43:25,460
Doctor Who.

4652
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:27,040
Doctor Who?

4653
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:30,920
Where is it?

4654
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:33,180
There's gonna be the open grave somewhere around here.

4655
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:34,040
You just gotta go find it.

4656
02:43:34,040 --> 02:43:35,300
Everything is a grave.

4657
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:37,400
Open.

4658
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:38,660
Open grave.

4659
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:39,300
Open.

4660
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:42,380
They're all graves.

4661
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:45,860
I don't think there's... I haven't seen a single grave actually.

4662
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,940
Maybe it's back here.

4663
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:50,280
Maybe.

4664
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:51,720
Oh!

4665
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:53,920
Oh wait, what's that down there?

4666
02:43:55,100 --> 02:43:56,360
Look at the mausoleum.

4667
02:43:56,960 --> 02:43:57,340
No, no, no.

4668
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,480
On the ground.

4669
02:43:59,280 --> 02:43:59,580
Oh hey!

4670
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:01,240
What is that?

4671
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:02,280
It's a collectible.

4672
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:03,320
Nevermind.

4673
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:05,200
Yeah, I don't think that mattered.

4674
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:06,480
That didn't matter.

4675
02:44:08,420 --> 02:44:10,300
Am I supposed to look at my compass?

4676
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:13,860
It might lead you.

4677
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:17,480
Oh, I can't go past this area.

4678
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:18,600
I mean, there's graves here.

4679
02:44:19,080 --> 02:44:19,240
That's disrespectful.

4680
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:23,320
You're like...

4681
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:24,260
Go around here.

4682
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:25,720
Just keep searching.

4683
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:26,480
We're safe in here.

4684
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:28,860
This is easy town.

4685
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:30,540
Or Britain.

4686
02:44:30,740 --> 02:44:30,980
I don't know.

4687
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:32,540
London.

4688
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:32,660
I don't know.

4689
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:34,040
I mean, the husband did shank me.

4690
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,340
So I don't think...

4691
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:35,860
It's...

4692
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:36,500
We're in London.

4693
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:38,460
I think we're in London right now.

4694
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:39,980
It was not...

4695
02:44:39,980 --> 02:44:40,100
I see London.

4696
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:41,060
I see France.

4697
02:44:42,180 --> 02:44:43,220
I see...

4698
02:44:43,860 --> 02:44:44,380
Minky's...

4699
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:45,280
Underpants.

4700
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:50,400
Yeah, on my new GamerSupps merch.

4701
02:44:53,360 --> 02:44:57,900
Use code COKEYBIRD on Min's new GamerSupp drop.

4702
02:45:05,400 --> 02:45:05,920
Oh.

4703
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:07,080
Is that the grave?

4704
02:45:07,400 --> 02:45:08,240
Oh, there it is.

4705
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:08,720
It's a crib.

4706
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:09,200
There it is.

4707
02:45:10,340 --> 02:45:11,440
Oh, that's kind of sad.

4708
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:12,960
Oh my god.

4709
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:14,340
Is the baby dead?

4710
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:16,600
I think everybody's dead.

4711
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:16,920
No?

4712
02:45:17,240 --> 02:45:17,560
Oh.

4713
02:45:18,260 --> 02:45:19,580
No, the baby's alive!

4714
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:20,320
He's alive!

4715
02:45:20,820 --> 02:45:20,880
You're alive!

4716
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:23,040
We just buried you alive!

4717
02:45:23,180 --> 02:45:24,800
That's alright, little baby.

4718
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:26,520
Oh my gosh.

4719
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:27,280
This reminds me.

4720
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:29,160
There was a lady who parked really bad.

4721
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:30,580
She kept parking really bad.

4722
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:33,000
Like, taking up multiple parking spots.

4723
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:37,880
And so, I wanted so badly to leave little rocks all over her windshield.

4724
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:42,680
I thought you were like, you wanted to bury her alive or something.

4725
02:45:43,180 --> 02:45:44,460
Cut to, you know?

4726
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:45,360
Alright.

4727
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,820
Oh, there's another easter egg in here.

4728
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:51,160
We are not doing this fucking...

4729
02:45:55,860 --> 02:45:58,040
Okay, so a compass would lead me home, right?

4730
02:45:59,100 --> 02:45:59,640
Hold on.

4731
02:45:59,900 --> 02:46:01,680
Uh, after the cutscene, open the box.

4732
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:03,000
Wait, did you- Oh, you got the toy.

4733
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:03,820
Yeah, I did.

4734
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:06,780
And then, return to the statue and take a right.

4735
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:07,900
Oh.

4736
02:46:08,060 --> 02:46:08,940
Oh, for an easter egg.

4737
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:09,360
Nevermind.

4738
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:10,520
Go back to the way you came.

4739
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:13,940
Alright, is it a fun easter egg?

4740
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:16,080
It doesn't tell me what it is.

4741
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:17,440
It just says for an easter egg.

4742
02:46:17,720 --> 02:46:18,680
Alright, let's see.

4743
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:19,020
Wait.

4744
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:20,200
Let's see what there is.

4745
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:20,800
There's a statue.

4746
02:46:21,440 --> 02:46:25,120
Before reaching the gate, take the small path to the right.

4747
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:26,080
To a dead end.

4748
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:27,580
It's this one.

4749
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:28,400
Or...

4750
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:28,820
This one?

4751
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:33,020
Easter egg.

4752
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:34,440
Easter egg.

4753
02:46:34,580 --> 02:46:35,460
Is this a flower?

4754
02:46:37,180 --> 02:46:39,280
It doesn't- It literally doesn't tell me what it is.

4755
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:40,200
It's this.

4756
02:46:40,360 --> 02:46:41,120
This is a dead end.

4757
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:42,140
Okay.

4758
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:44,920
And follow it.

4759
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:46,820
Oh, people are saying it's the flower.

4760
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:49,160
That's not an easter egg though.

4761
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:49,860
That's just a flower.

4762
02:46:49,860 --> 02:46:50,280
That's like a collectible.

4763
02:46:50,480 --> 02:46:50,700
Yeah.

4764
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:54,840
Oh, there's a dead end here.

4765
02:46:56,380 --> 02:46:56,820
JK.

4766
02:46:58,140 --> 02:46:58,580
Okay.

4767
02:46:58,700 --> 02:47:00,220
Oh, someone said it was a flower.

4768
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:01,280
Oh, okay.

4769
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:01,740
Nevermind.

4770
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:02,840
Okay, I'm lost now.

4771
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:03,540
Where am I?

4772
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:05,880
No, there's an- Oh, no!

4773
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:06,760
This is the easter egg.

4774
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:06,980
Oh.

4775
02:47:08,580 --> 02:47:10,200
Press- Press F to pay-

4776
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:22,000
That it?

4777
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:28,200
What's that sound from?

4778
02:47:29,660 --> 02:47:30,820
Same, bro.

4779
02:47:31,620 --> 02:47:37,060
I don't- Where's that- That guy was letting out all his frustrations from this game.

4780
02:47:39,100 --> 02:47:41,020
Okay, we found the real easter egg.

4781
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:42,680
We found the real easter egg, guys.

4782
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,060
See?

4783
02:47:43,300 --> 02:47:44,120
I did it one guy.

4784
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:45,460
You, everyone else, he chatted.

4785
02:47:46,780 --> 02:47:49,920
We would've missed out on that Kino moment, everybody.

4786
02:47:50,120 --> 02:47:51,920
It was so important.

4787
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:53,740
Me when I'm- It was so important.

4788
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:55,480
Me when I'm playing massage.

4789
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:01,040
Oh, my God.

4790
02:48:02,220 --> 02:48:03,800
Paid respect, guys.

4791
02:48:04,980 --> 02:48:07,120
That was so silly.

4792
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:08,140
Oh, my God.

4793
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:09,200
So silly.

4794
02:48:09,820 --> 02:48:10,180
Okay.

4795
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:11,440
We can leave now.

4796
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:15,060
All right.

4797
02:48:15,560 --> 02:48:16,520
Out we go.

4798
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,260
To freedom.

4799
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:26,520
Wait.

4800
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:28,840
Look to the right.

4801
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:30,160
Is there- No.

4802
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:30,960
Oh.

4803
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:35,540
It says something in the mausoleum, so I think actually you gotta go back up to that mausoleum.

4804
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:36,440
Oh, my God.

4805
02:48:37,300 --> 02:48:37,580
Oh, wait.

4806
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:37,940
Wait.

4807
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:38,400
Oh, hold on.

4808
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:39,000
Turn right.

4809
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:39,560
There.

4810
02:48:39,740 --> 02:48:40,040
This way.

4811
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:41,900
I think we go down this way.

4812
02:48:43,300 --> 02:48:45,200
The guide is not very clear.

4813
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:48,040
Screen ray, I have- I have a lot of issues.

4814
02:48:48,820 --> 02:49:06,440
I- I- Read you what it says to me.

4815
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:06,700
Okay.

4816
02:49:07,340 --> 02:49:07,500
Um.

4817
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:09,900
Interact with the grave to start a cutscene.

4818
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:11,680
After the cutscene, open the box.

4819
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:12,600
Grab the toy.

4820
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:15,860
Return the same way down the walkway back to the statue.

4821
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:19,420
Take a right for an Easter egg just before reaching the gate.

4822
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,880
Is it- Which gate is it talking about?

4823
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:22,920
It's this one.

4824
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:23,340
Take the small path.

4825
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:28,380
Then go back the same way to reach the gate.

4826
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:31,960
Exit through the gate to find the door to the mausoleum on the right and open it.

4827
02:49:31,960 --> 02:49:32,860
So go back the mausoleum.

4828
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:36,820
Oh my God, we should- Oh my God, it was the mausoleum this entire time.

4829
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:38,680
It's fine.

4830
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:40,060
It's not even that far away.

4831
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:41,480
It's the- the gate, Doki.

4832
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:42,200
It's the gate.

4833
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:42,880
The gate.

4834
02:49:42,880 --> 02:49:44,920
How could you not notice the fucking gate?

4835
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:46,100
It's the gate!

4836
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:46,680
It's the gate!

4837
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:47,000
It's right here!

4838
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,140
There's like only five gates in this area!

4839
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:52,800
How am I supposed to know which gate was the gate?

4840
02:49:52,940 --> 02:49:53,960
Oh my God, there's the gate.

4841
02:49:56,480 --> 02:49:57,280
The gate?

4842
02:49:57,560 --> 02:49:58,160
The gate.

4843
02:49:58,940 --> 02:50:02,320
Okay, now we're gonna go to where the progress room is.

4844
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:04,520
But you need the hammer for it.

4845
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:06,340
Oh, fuck, okay.

4846
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:07,360
Yeah.

4847
02:50:08,020 --> 02:50:08,140
Okay.

4848
02:50:09,440 --> 02:50:10,500
Down I go.

4849
02:50:11,080 --> 02:50:11,680
Wee!

4850
02:50:11,900 --> 02:50:14,880
If you put your hands up in the air, it feels even faster!

4851
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:16,100
Wee!

4852
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:18,720
Wee!

4853
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:19,200
Wee!

4854
02:50:19,480 --> 02:50:19,740
Wee!

4855
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:20,100
Wee!

4856
02:50:20,940 --> 02:50:21,540
Wee!

4857
02:50:21,880 --> 02:50:25,260
Oh my god, how far is this area?

4858
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:26,420
Wee!

4859
02:50:26,420 --> 02:50:26,820
Wee!

4860
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:31,420
That could have been a cutscene.

4861
02:50:31,540 --> 02:50:32,980
Like a driving cutscene!

4862
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:35,780
You could have made this a cutscene for me!

4863
02:50:36,340 --> 02:50:39,420
Oh, but you're in the basement, so you can just grab the sledgehammer and go.

4864
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:40,960
Okay.

4865
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:46,540
You know, I don't think you need the compass anymore, but don't trust...

4866
02:50:47,560 --> 02:50:49,160
I'm not gonna trust you.

4867
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:53,460
Yeah.

4868
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:57,900
Grab that bad boy, and then we'll go through the toilet hole.

4869
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:01,280
Toilet hole we go.

4870
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:01,740
Yeah.

4871
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:03,280
The boy's hole.

4872
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:04,200
The troll.

4873
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:04,940
Go, troll.

4874
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:09,080
It be...

4875
02:51:09,080 --> 02:51:11,580
Oh my god, why does this take like 50 seconds?

4876
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:14,040
You jump through this hole like 30 times.

4877
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:16,360
You do not have to be like, is this safe?

4878
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:16,960
Like...

4879
02:51:16,960 --> 02:51:17,400
I know!

4880
02:51:17,580 --> 02:51:18,220
Every time!

4881
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:21,680
I would save also if you can.

4882
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,960
Yeah, I'll have to get out of this door to be able to save.

4883
02:51:24,740 --> 02:51:25,040
Yeah.

4884
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:26,740
Okie dokie.

4885
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:27,880
Oh, there's a baby crying.

4886
02:51:28,640 --> 02:51:29,800
Baby, stop crying.

4887
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:30,060
And a car honking.

4888
02:51:31,240 --> 02:51:32,000
Baby, stop crying!

4889
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,300
Baby, stop crying!

4890
02:51:32,660 --> 02:51:34,460
Alright, you remember how to get to the progress room.

4891
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:35,480
Yes.

4892
02:51:36,860 --> 02:51:37,400
No.

4893
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:38,380
Yes.

4894
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:38,860
Uh.

4895
02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:44,080
Right here.

4896
02:51:44,260 --> 02:51:44,460
Yeah.

4897
02:51:45,280 --> 02:51:45,400
Oh.

4898
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:47,320
Oh.

4899
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:48,020
What was that?

4900
02:51:49,940 --> 02:51:51,100
Smashy, smashy.

4901
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:52,780
Oh my god, the fuck?

4902
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:53,220
Woah!

4903
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:54,740
Woah!

4904
02:51:55,700 --> 02:51:57,140
Say goodbye to baby.

4905
02:51:58,680 --> 02:52:00,500
It's like taking candy from a baby.

4906
02:52:00,820 --> 02:52:01,240
The baby is holding a spear.

4907
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:01,640
Oh my god.

4908
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:02,440
The orb.

4909
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:03,120
The baby orb.

4910
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:03,780
The baby orb.

4911
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:05,660
Mine.

4912
02:52:07,060 --> 02:52:07,700
Ok, hold on.

4913
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:08,020
Uh.

4914
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:09,720
Yep.

4915
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,120
Ok, you're gonna take...

4916
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:11,200
Oh.

4917
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:18,200
Ok, what do I do?

4918
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:19,480
Uh.

4919
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,580
You're gonna take the spear to the garage.

4920
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:24,280
What do I do in the garage with the spear?

4921
02:52:24,660 --> 02:52:26,980
Oh, but there's gonna be a sequence where Dolores is...

4922
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:28,200
Is trying to catch you.

4923
02:52:28,580 --> 02:52:29,380
Oh my god.

4924
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:29,620
Oh my god.

4925
02:52:29,620 --> 02:52:31,200
So, um, basically...

4926
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:32,500
Yeah, yeah.

4927
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:33,160
Nice, nice, nice.

4928
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:35,520
Basically, um...

4929
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,440
There's gonna be a work bench on...

4930
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:38,780
In the garage to break open the spear.

4931
02:52:38,780 --> 02:52:39,160
How am I going crazy?

4932
02:52:39,580 --> 02:52:40,580
How am I going crazy?

4933
02:52:40,580 --> 02:52:41,220
How am I going crazy?

4934
02:52:42,040 --> 02:52:43,560
Because we're in the womb!

4935
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,500
It has light!

4936
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:47,600
The womb makes me crazy!

4937
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:48,720
The womb makes me crazy!

4938
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:49,560
Ok.

4939
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:54,200
Ok, but...

4940
02:52:58,440 --> 02:52:58,880
Beep.

4941
02:52:59,460 --> 02:53:00,280
Wait, wasn't that the...

4942
02:53:00,960 --> 02:53:01,400
Beep.

4943
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:03,100
You could've gone to the garage from there, I guess.

4944
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:03,840
But, it's fine.

4945
02:53:04,060 --> 02:53:04,360
Yeah.

4946
02:53:04,660 --> 02:53:08,340
I just wanna take a leisure walk when Dolores tries to kill me.

4947
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:10,560
I guess maybe she's not coming there.

4948
02:53:10,640 --> 02:53:11,000
I don't know.

4949
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:13,940
Do this?

4950
02:53:13,940 --> 02:53:14,680
Ok, that thing right there.

4951
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:15,420
I'm pretty sure.

4952
02:53:15,660 --> 02:53:15,760
Do this?

4953
02:53:18,820 --> 02:53:20,680
I think we skipped the cutscene.

4954
02:53:20,860 --> 02:53:21,140
That's nice.

4955
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:31,060
I'm going crazy while I'm doing this?

4956
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:31,700
How?

4957
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:34,020
I'm in the alarm!

4958
02:53:34,560 --> 02:53:34,640
Because of the alarm!

4959
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:35,340
The alarm!

4960
02:53:36,040 --> 02:53:36,500
What's right?

4961
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:38,360
It should be reassuring me!

4962
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:40,640
Ok, let's read the note.

4963
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:43,240
I didn't read it.

4964
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:44,100
Oh.

4965
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:45,200
Uh.

4966
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:47,660
There it is.

4967
02:53:48,020 --> 02:53:48,100
Oh.

4968
02:53:49,820 --> 02:53:50,400
Uh.

4969
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:51,440
Um.

4970
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:51,980
Oh.

4971
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:52,960
Um.

4972
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:53,280
There it goes.

4973
02:53:55,480 --> 02:53:56,820
How are we supposed to read it?

4974
02:53:56,820 --> 02:53:57,600
Ok, there we go.

4975
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:58,780
Oh, there we go.

4976
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:00,460
Oh, it's the clock!

4977
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:01,220
Remember the clocks?

4978
02:54:01,660 --> 02:54:03,340
No, did you remember the clock?

4979
02:54:04,040 --> 02:54:06,660
One was 1230, one was...

4980
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:08,080
What does all of this mean?

4981
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:11,500
Well, luckily we have a guide that will help us.

4982
02:54:11,860 --> 02:54:13,140
Alright, so now...

4983
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:20,380
First floor hallway where the Felix the Cat clock was near the bookshelves.

4984
02:54:20,380 --> 02:54:20,780
What?

4985
02:54:22,080 --> 02:54:22,640
What?

4986
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

4987
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:41,120
Mirror number nine is in the first floor hallway near some bookshelves.

4988
02:54:41,800 --> 02:54:43,360
Break the mirror and enter...

4989
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:44,460
Remember that's where the...

4990
02:54:44,460 --> 02:54:45,320
That's where the...

4991
02:54:45,320 --> 02:54:45,340
The clocks.

4992
02:54:45,460 --> 02:54:45,720
The clocks.

4993
02:54:45,720 --> 02:54:46,340
The clocks are.

4994
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:46,640
Ok.

4995
02:54:46,640 --> 02:54:46,940
Yeah.

4996
02:54:48,380 --> 02:54:49,080
Yeah.

4997
02:54:49,360 --> 02:54:49,880
I need to pee.

4998
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:51,520
Ok.

4999
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:55,640
Yeah.

5000
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:01,720
Um...

5001
02:55:01,720 --> 02:55:04,380
Guys, we're on mirror nine out of...

5002
02:55:05,740 --> 02:55:06,340
Eleven.

5003
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:08,200
We're definitely gonna finish this today.

5004
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:09,440
Thank goodness for...

5005
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:12,260
For the, uh...

5006
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:13,380
Walkthrough, huh?

5007
02:55:15,700 --> 02:55:16,540
Hi, Mint.

5008
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:16,900
Hi!

5009
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:18,580
Mmm...

5010
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:20,440
I'm doing my best as a...

5011
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:22,460
As a little guide, you know?

5012
02:55:25,280 --> 02:55:25,840
Yeah.

5013
02:55:27,360 --> 02:55:27,920
Yeah.

5014
02:55:28,580 --> 02:55:30,500
How does one play this without a guide?

5015
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:33,000
I don't know.

5016
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:33,840
I don't know.

5017
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:35,700
I don't know.

5018
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,280
This one has a lot of text underneath it though.

5019
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:42,100
So I'm gonna read it right now to you guys.

5020
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:43,100
We're gonna all read it together.

5021
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:43,760
Ok.

5022
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:46,780
Mirror number nine is on the first floor hallway near some bookshelves.

5023
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:48,600
Break the mirror and enter the large square hallway.

5024
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:49,560
That's the one with the clocks.

5025
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,660
Use the note from mirror eight to set the clocks on the left wall.

5026
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:53,240
Ok.

5027
02:55:53,480 --> 02:55:55,320
And then I have what they should be set to.

5028
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,500
So I could cheat, but I'm gonna let Doki read it.

5029
02:55:57,500 --> 02:55:59,480
Then turn left to follow the hall.

5030
02:55:59,700 --> 02:56:01,720
Arrange the decorative plates.

5031
02:56:01,940 --> 02:56:03,380
Did we see plates?

5032
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:05,860
In this area based on the note as well.

5033
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:11,960
The plate with the man on it should be turned three times until the head faces left.

5034
02:56:12,060 --> 02:56:17,200
While the woman's plate should be turned once so the head faces to the right.

5035
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:21,660
Lastly, the center plate with the mother and the baby should stay upright.

5036
02:56:23,140 --> 02:56:24,500
Read it in Kermit voice.

5037
02:56:24,500 --> 02:56:25,200
Ahem.

5038
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:28,740
Now turn left to continue following the hall.

5039
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:33,580
Across from the hanging clothes, use the note to arrange the three windows.

5040
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:38,180
The two outer ones should be open while the middle one remains closed.

5041
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:44,320
Go past the hanging clothes and turn left again to see the three candle holders.

5042
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:48,760
You know guys, I heard Kermit the Frog's voice very recently.

5043
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:53,440
And I realized that what I sound like doesn't sound like...

5044
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:55,480
Doesn't sound like...

5045
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:56,560
Doesn't sound like Kermit the Frog.

5046
02:57:16,240 --> 02:57:17,440
Hello, welcome back.

5047
02:57:19,820 --> 02:57:21,580
Light a candle and place it in the middle.

5048
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:25,080
Walk around the hall following the sound of a baby crying until a passage opens.

5049
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:26,780
Then go inside and take the baby monitor.

5050
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:30,820
Bring the baby monitor to the parents' room, turn it on, jot down the code coming through the monitor.

5051
02:57:32,060 --> 02:57:32,460
What?

5052
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:36,780
I was explaining everything that we have to do in the next part.

5053
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:40,680
Okay, so we gotta go to the peepo room.

5054
02:57:42,180 --> 02:57:42,580
Again?

5055
02:57:44,880 --> 02:57:46,460
Well, we will eventually, yeah.

5056
02:57:46,460 --> 02:57:47,400
Um...

5057
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:47,700
Okay.

5058
02:57:48,180 --> 02:57:48,740
Okay.

5059
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:49,980
Okay, so go to...

5060
02:57:49,980 --> 02:57:51,560
I think I remember where this one is.

5061
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:52,440
The mirror room?

5062
02:57:55,340 --> 02:57:56,520
Do you wanna trust...

5063
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:57,480
Do you trust me?

5064
02:57:57,780 --> 02:57:59,480
M'lady, do you trust me?

5065
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:06,320
Do you trust me?

5066
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:08,480
I think it was the first one you broke.

5067
02:58:08,900 --> 02:58:10,120
Oh my god.

5068
02:58:12,020 --> 02:58:12,580
Okay.

5069
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:15,620
Do we go to the clock room?

5070
02:58:16,040 --> 02:58:16,480
Yes.

5071
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:17,180
Is that where we go?

5072
02:58:17,440 --> 02:58:19,560
Okay, I know where the clock room is.

5073
02:58:19,880 --> 02:58:20,060
Okay.

5074
02:58:21,160 --> 02:58:21,640
Okay.

5075
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:24,880
Oh, the comfort.

5076
02:58:28,780 --> 02:58:29,840
It's right here.

5077
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:32,580
Do we need the hammer?

5078
02:58:33,920 --> 02:58:35,580
I don't think so.

5079
02:58:44,380 --> 02:58:45,720
This isn't the clock room.

5080
02:58:45,720 --> 02:58:46,660
This isn't the clock room.

5081
02:58:46,660 --> 02:58:47,960
No, you just passed it.

5082
02:58:48,320 --> 02:58:49,100
You had it.

5083
02:58:49,240 --> 02:58:49,980
You passed it.

5084
02:58:50,100 --> 02:58:51,800
It's the one right there, yeah.

5085
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:53,100
It's the sign.

5086
02:58:53,100 --> 02:58:53,660
I was gonna say.

5087
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:55,560
Okay.

5088
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:56,200
Okay.

5089
02:58:56,940 --> 02:59:00,220
Now you're gonna use the note to change the clocks.

5090
02:59:03,440 --> 02:59:04,340
You got this.

5091
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:05,500
Oh my god.

5092
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:05,920
What was the sign?

5093
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:07,620
You can read analog clock, right?

5094
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:12,280
Okay.

5095
02:59:13,220 --> 02:59:13,780
6...

5096
02:59:13,780 --> 02:59:14,540
3...

5097
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:15,600
30...

5098
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:16,280
12...

5099
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:17,180
36...

5100
02:59:17,180 --> 02:59:18,420
Okay, remember that for me.

5101
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:19,640
Okay.

5102
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:25,640
6...

5103
02:59:25,640 --> 02:59:26,240
6...

5104
02:59:26,240 --> 02:59:26,580
Nice.

5105
02:59:28,060 --> 02:59:28,700
6...

5106
02:59:28,700 --> 02:59:29,760
3...

5107
02:59:32,340 --> 02:59:32,980
30...

5108
02:59:33,780 --> 02:59:34,420
The...

5109
02:59:34,420 --> 02:59:35,740
Okay, this is not...

5110
02:59:35,740 --> 02:59:36,820
Oh, wow, that's messed up.

5111
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:37,960
That's so...

5112
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:39,240
Wait, this is so messed up.

5113
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:40,160
Okay.

5114
02:59:41,220 --> 02:59:41,640
3...

5115
02:59:42,780 --> 02:59:43,420
30...

5116
02:59:44,500 --> 02:59:45,780
And then...

5117
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:46,180
12...

5118
02:59:47,360 --> 02:59:48,000
30...

5119
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,120
And what was the other one?

5120
02:59:50,100 --> 02:59:50,740
Um...

5121
02:59:50,740 --> 02:59:51,200
The plates.

5122
02:59:56,250 --> 02:59:56,730
Um...

5123
02:59:56,730 --> 02:59:58,610
Wow, the guide says...

5124
02:59:58,610 --> 02:59:58,850
2...

5125
02:59:58,850 --> 02:59:59,370
30...

5126
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:00,310
That means it's wrong.

5127
03:00:01,630 --> 03:00:02,570
Oh, fuck.

5128
03:00:03,630 --> 03:00:04,930
That's messed up.

5129
03:00:09,870 --> 03:00:11,850
Okay, and then there was one more thing.

5130
03:00:12,050 --> 03:00:12,670
Wait, no, no, no.

5131
03:00:12,730 --> 03:00:13,610
I think you're right.

5132
03:00:13,950 --> 03:00:14,570
No, it...

5133
03:00:14,570 --> 03:00:15,870
The paper says 3...

5134
03:00:15,870 --> 03:00:16,090
30.

5135
03:00:16,190 --> 03:00:16,870
I see it though.

5136
03:00:17,950 --> 03:00:18,430
Look.

5137
03:00:18,430 --> 03:00:18,470
Look.

5138
03:00:18,610 --> 03:00:19,470
I swear to God.

5139
03:00:20,350 --> 03:00:21,270
It says 3.

5140
03:00:21,390 --> 03:00:21,630
30.

5141
03:00:22,730 --> 03:00:23,770
Oh, my God.

5142
03:00:23,850 --> 03:00:24,950
Is it because it's like...

5143
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:26,030
Almost to 3?

5144
03:00:27,850 --> 03:00:28,950
Oh, no.

5145
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:29,750
I don't think so.

5146
03:00:31,310 --> 03:00:32,290
Oh, maybe.

5147
03:00:32,690 --> 03:00:33,030
Wait.

5148
03:00:34,210 --> 03:00:35,250
There's no way.

5149
03:00:35,430 --> 03:00:36,370
The guide is wrong.

5150
03:00:36,430 --> 03:00:37,090
No, I don't think so.

5151
03:00:37,370 --> 03:00:37,650
It's...

5152
03:00:37,650 --> 03:00:38,450
It's 2.30?

5153
03:00:38,450 --> 03:00:39,090
It is?

5154
03:00:39,690 --> 03:00:41,030
Oh, my God.

5155
03:00:41,250 --> 03:00:41,510
I...

5156
03:00:41,510 --> 03:00:42,570
It looks like 3 though.

5157
03:00:42,570 --> 03:00:43,230
It does.

5158
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:45,270
Wait, it's locked in place.

5159
03:00:45,270 --> 03:00:46,570
No, the guide is wrong.

5160
03:00:47,050 --> 03:00:48,290
The guide is wrong.

5161
03:00:48,430 --> 03:00:49,150
It's locked in place.

5162
03:00:49,150 --> 03:00:49,310
It's locked in place.

5163
03:00:49,510 --> 03:00:49,590
Yeah.

5164
03:00:50,690 --> 03:00:51,690
That's messed up.

5165
03:00:51,910 --> 03:00:52,630
Stay like saving.

5166
03:00:52,630 --> 03:00:53,590
Stay like saving.

5167
03:00:53,670 --> 03:00:53,910
Okay.

5168
03:00:54,150 --> 03:00:55,210
So, um...

5169
03:00:55,210 --> 03:00:55,550
Hold on.

5170
03:00:55,790 --> 03:00:56,490
There's a...

5171
03:00:56,490 --> 03:00:57,430
So...

5172
03:00:57,430 --> 03:00:58,810
Now turn left.

5173
03:00:58,970 --> 03:01:00,490
Continue following the hall across from the...

5174
03:01:00,490 --> 03:01:00,950
Hanging clothes.

5175
03:01:00,950 --> 03:01:01,210
Okay.

5176
03:01:01,330 --> 03:01:01,490
So, yeah.

5177
03:01:01,610 --> 03:01:01,850
Keep going.

5178
03:01:03,030 --> 03:01:04,130
There's three windows.

5179
03:01:07,970 --> 03:01:08,430
Uh...

5180
03:01:10,770 --> 03:01:11,510
How'd you know?

5181
03:01:12,310 --> 03:01:13,150
The paper.

5182
03:01:13,850 --> 03:01:15,110
It says it on there too?

5183
03:01:15,390 --> 03:01:15,630
Yeah.

5184
03:01:15,630 --> 03:01:15,990
Oh, I didn't see.

5185
03:01:16,150 --> 03:01:16,910
Wait, let me see.

5186
03:01:17,850 --> 03:01:18,690
I wanna see.

5187
03:01:19,890 --> 03:01:20,730
Oh, you're right!

5188
03:01:20,930 --> 03:01:21,090
Yeah.

5189
03:01:21,290 --> 03:01:22,690
The two outer...

5190
03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:22,850
Yep.

5191
03:01:23,670 --> 03:01:24,150
And then what?

5192
03:01:25,310 --> 03:01:25,770
Um...

5193
03:01:25,770 --> 03:01:27,030
Now you're gonna...

5194
03:01:27,030 --> 03:01:27,670
Keep going.

5195
03:01:29,490 --> 03:01:29,950
Oh.

5196
03:01:31,570 --> 03:01:32,350
Who's humming?

5197
03:01:33,370 --> 03:01:33,930
Okay.

5198
03:01:34,050 --> 03:01:35,230
I think you just keep walking.

5199
03:01:37,990 --> 03:01:41,290
It says there's something about candle holders, but...

5200
03:01:41,890 --> 03:01:43,390
I don't see them.

5201
03:01:45,950 --> 03:01:47,370
Oh, okay.

5202
03:01:47,630 --> 03:01:48,170
There's no can...

5203
03:01:48,170 --> 03:01:48,610
Oh, wait.

5204
03:01:48,770 --> 03:01:49,390
Maybe here?

5205
03:01:53,370 --> 03:01:53,650
Oh.

5206
03:01:54,330 --> 03:01:54,850
Yeah.

5207
03:01:54,950 --> 03:01:55,890
Grab a baby monitor.

5208
03:01:56,410 --> 03:01:57,230
Oh my god.

5209
03:01:57,230 --> 03:01:57,950
I need two hands.

5210
03:01:57,950 --> 03:01:59,430
Why do you need two hands to hold the baby monitor?

5211
03:01:59,750 --> 03:02:00,350
I...

5212
03:02:04,540 --> 03:02:05,580
I'm sad.

5213
03:02:06,300 --> 03:02:08,460
Why does it make me use two hands?

5214
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,600
Gibberish, gibberish, gibberish.

5215
03:02:13,780 --> 03:02:14,100
Alright, so now we go...

5216
03:02:14,100 --> 03:02:14,580
Just grab any!

5217
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:15,720
It doesn't matter!

5218
03:02:15,900 --> 03:02:16,760
Just grab one!

5219
03:02:17,260 --> 03:02:19,340
There's 200 of them!

5220
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:21,880
Okay.

5221
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:24,640
Okay.

5222
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:24,680
Alright.

5223
03:02:25,140 --> 03:02:26,740
Now we go back to the parents' room.

5224
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:28,740
Okay.

5225
03:02:30,340 --> 03:02:31,160
Can you save?

5226
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:33,300
Where's the parents' room?

5227
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:36,200
Oh...

5228
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:37,080
Remember where...

5229
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:37,220
Where's the attic?

5230
03:02:37,840 --> 03:02:38,340
Yeah, yeah.

5231
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:39,400
You gotta go through the attic.

5232
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:40,900
Like...

5233
03:02:43,460 --> 03:02:43,680
Fuck.

5234
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:45,140
Ugh.

5235
03:02:47,480 --> 03:02:47,920
Can...

5236
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:50,400
Does the parents' room door, like, just not open?

5237
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:51,480
Or is it, like, weird?

5238
03:02:52,820 --> 03:02:54,100
What do you mean you can't use that here?

5239
03:02:54,200 --> 03:02:54,920
Shut the hell up.

5240
03:03:01,280 --> 03:03:02,160
Bing bong.

5241
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:03,060
Bing bong.

5242
03:03:04,060 --> 03:03:04,500
My...

5243
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:06,120
My sanity is really red.

5244
03:03:06,280 --> 03:03:07,140
I'm a little concerned.

5245
03:03:08,100 --> 03:03:08,920
Is she chasing you?

5246
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:09,720
No.

5247
03:03:09,720 --> 03:03:10,780
I don't know anymore.

5248
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,700
I'm just going into the room.

5249
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:14,140
Yeah, just go to the room.

5250
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:15,020
Just going into the room.

5251
03:03:15,240 --> 03:03:16,100
Go to the safe room.

5252
03:03:16,860 --> 03:03:17,180
Okay.

5253
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:20,020
Okay.

5254
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:21,480
Alright.

5255
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:22,480
Put that on there.

5256
03:03:23,080 --> 03:03:23,780
Very nice.

5257
03:03:24,440 --> 03:03:27,040
And put that on the baby monitor thing.

5258
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:33,600
This is the base of the baby monitor.

5259
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:35,740
Where the fuck do I put this baby monitor?

5260
03:03:39,380 --> 03:03:44,220
It just says bring it to the parents' room, turn it on, and jot down the code.

5261
03:03:44,500 --> 03:03:45,020
Oh, there it is.

5262
03:03:46,180 --> 03:03:46,340
Zero.

5263
03:03:46,340 --> 03:03:46,700
Three.

5264
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:48,260
Seven.

5265
03:03:51,180 --> 03:03:51,560
Three.

5266
03:03:52,460 --> 03:03:52,940
Five.

5267
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:54,380
Zero.

5268
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:54,620
Three.

5269
03:03:54,620 --> 03:03:54,800
Zero.

5270
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:56,080
Three.

5271
03:03:56,900 --> 03:03:57,260
Seven.

5272
03:03:57,260 --> 03:03:57,600
Okay.

5273
03:03:58,040 --> 03:03:58,340
Oh, yeah.

5274
03:03:58,340 --> 03:03:59,920
So bring Dolores the baby.

5275
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:02,400
Um, wait.

5276
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:05,120
The 10th mirror is located in the second floor bathroom.

5277
03:04:05,980 --> 03:04:06,360
Seven.

5278
03:04:07,180 --> 03:04:08,120
Did we break that one?

5279
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:11,260
Five.

5280
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:12,540
Zero.

5281
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:14,040
Three.

5282
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:15,580
Seven.

5283
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:20,380
Five.

5284
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:21,720
Zero.

5285
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:22,220
Three.

5286
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:24,960
You mean there's a mirror in the fucking bathroom?

5287
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:25,060
Two.

5288
03:04:25,640 --> 03:04:26,040
Three.

5289
03:04:27,120 --> 03:04:27,520
Three.

5290
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:27,660
Yeah.

5291
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:29,500
Five.

5292
03:04:30,280 --> 03:04:32,300
Well, um, there's only this one.

5293
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:33,680
This is the last one you have to break.

5294
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:39,920
We're so...

5295
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:40,620
Toki, we...

5296
03:04:40,620 --> 03:04:42,840
It's this one, and then one more, and then we're done.

5297
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:43,620
We're so close.

5298
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:45,580
There's one more after...

5299
03:04:46,580 --> 03:04:47,660
We're almost there.

5300
03:04:50,990 --> 03:04:51,750
45 minutes.

5301
03:04:51,890 --> 03:04:52,510
We can do this.

5302
03:04:52,650 --> 03:04:53,470
We can do this.

5303
03:04:55,250 --> 03:04:56,050
We can do this.

5304
03:04:56,050 --> 03:04:56,530
I trust.

5305
03:04:57,290 --> 03:04:59,690
I have to go back to the basement that you don't understand!

5306
03:05:00,630 --> 03:05:01,830
I have to go back!

5307
03:05:02,430 --> 03:05:04,230
You just go to the basement and then you come back...

5308
03:05:08,490 --> 03:05:09,530
You got this.

5309
03:05:11,550 --> 03:05:12,350
Later time.

5310
03:05:12,470 --> 03:05:13,970
You don't even have to remember the code.

5311
03:05:14,090 --> 03:05:14,710
I have a cheat.

5312
03:05:19,410 --> 03:05:20,450
Where is it though?

5313
03:05:21,070 --> 03:05:22,470
Where is the mirror?

5314
03:05:22,710 --> 03:05:22,970
Wait.

5315
03:05:23,350 --> 03:05:24,590
Actually, go inside and look.

5316
03:05:24,730 --> 03:05:25,090
I think I...

5317
03:05:25,090 --> 03:05:25,670
Wait, go inside.

5318
03:05:25,830 --> 03:05:26,250
I see it.

5319
03:05:26,250 --> 03:05:26,750
I'm pretty...

5320
03:05:26,750 --> 03:05:27,070
Is it this?

5321
03:05:27,170 --> 03:05:27,270
No.

5322
03:05:27,510 --> 03:05:28,030
Turn around.

5323
03:05:28,210 --> 03:05:28,590
Turn around.

5324
03:05:31,350 --> 03:05:32,470
Why are you...

5325
03:05:32,470 --> 03:05:32,750
Why...

5326
03:05:32,750 --> 03:05:33,150
What are you doing?

5327
03:05:33,250 --> 03:05:33,810
What do you mean?

5328
03:05:33,870 --> 03:05:35,230
There's nowhere in here!

5329
03:05:35,370 --> 03:05:35,990
Turn around!

5330
03:05:36,130 --> 03:05:36,670
Go inside.

5331
03:05:36,930 --> 03:05:37,390
Go inside.

5332
03:05:37,730 --> 03:05:38,110
Go inside.

5333
03:05:38,770 --> 03:05:39,550
Over there!

5334
03:05:39,550 --> 03:05:42,290
My fucking god!

5335
03:05:42,530 --> 03:05:43,310
Oh!

5336
03:05:51,530 --> 03:05:53,290
This is why you need to look!

5337
03:05:53,490 --> 03:05:55,190
You need to use your eyes, doggy!

5338
03:05:57,490 --> 03:05:59,810
Back into the hallway!

5339
03:06:00,650 --> 03:06:01,390
Spin!

5340
03:06:01,730 --> 03:06:02,450
Spin!

5341
03:06:03,530 --> 03:06:04,190
Spin!

5342
03:06:06,190 --> 03:06:07,110
Wee!

5343
03:06:10,110 --> 03:06:11,030
Wee!

5344
03:06:12,490 --> 03:06:13,410
Wee!

5345
03:06:15,210 --> 03:06:16,130
Wee!

5346
03:06:16,610 --> 03:06:17,230
Wee!

5347
03:06:17,230 --> 03:06:17,750
Wee!

5348
03:06:18,050 --> 03:06:18,070
Wee!

5349
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:18,230
Wee!

5350
03:06:18,230 --> 03:06:18,310
Wee!

5351
03:06:18,310 --> 03:06:20,330
I wish this was a fucking cutscene!

5352
03:06:20,930 --> 03:06:21,370
I...

5353
03:06:23,470 --> 03:06:26,510
This is so unnecessarily obtuse.

5354
03:06:26,510 --> 03:06:29,410
Like, it's just so...

5355
03:06:29,410 --> 03:06:31,210
Like, it's just so...

5356
03:06:31,210 --> 03:06:31,230
Wow!

5357
03:06:31,790 --> 03:06:32,710
In our favorite place!

5358
03:06:32,710 --> 03:06:32,730
Alright!

5359
03:06:32,970 --> 03:06:34,090
Go grab the sledgehammer!

5360
03:06:34,410 --> 03:06:35,450
And then...

5361
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:36,010
Um...

5362
03:06:36,010 --> 03:06:36,850
Through the poop chute.

5363
03:06:39,210 --> 03:06:39,690
Okay.

5364
03:06:41,190 --> 03:06:41,610
Nice.

5365
03:06:41,610 --> 03:06:44,750
Get to the sledgehammer storage room!

5366
03:06:50,670 --> 03:06:51,230
Okay.

5367
03:06:51,910 --> 03:06:52,930
And then we leave.

5368
03:06:53,230 --> 03:06:53,490
Yay!

5369
03:06:53,650 --> 03:06:54,590
Let's look at this hole!

5370
03:06:54,790 --> 03:06:55,590
Is it safe?

5371
03:06:55,770 --> 03:06:56,370
I wonder!

5372
03:06:56,590 --> 03:06:59,090
After the 40th time I jump through it!

5373
03:06:59,270 --> 03:07:01,170
Is this a safe hole?

5374
03:07:02,410 --> 03:07:02,950
Whoa!

5375
03:07:05,090 --> 03:07:05,650
Yippee!

5376
03:07:05,650 --> 03:07:06,090
My god!

5377
03:07:06,350 --> 03:07:07,530
It takes so long!

5378
03:07:12,370 --> 03:07:13,050
Okay.

5379
03:07:13,190 --> 03:07:13,490
Okay.

5380
03:07:13,810 --> 03:07:14,930
Back to the Christ room.

5381
03:07:15,750 --> 03:07:15,870
Yeah.

5382
03:07:17,810 --> 03:07:18,390
Alright.

5383
03:07:19,510 --> 03:07:21,430
Okay, back at it again.

5384
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:22,670
Alright.

5385
03:07:23,910 --> 03:07:24,170
Hank!

5386
03:07:24,750 --> 03:07:25,170
Because this...

5387
03:07:25,170 --> 03:07:27,530
Because Dolores had to just...

5388
03:07:27,530 --> 03:07:29,030
Lock up all the rooms!

5389
03:07:29,330 --> 03:07:29,490
Oh!

5390
03:07:29,630 --> 03:07:30,710
And she turned off the lights!

5391
03:07:31,170 --> 03:07:31,330
Oh!

5392
03:07:31,550 --> 03:07:32,090
And all!

5393
03:07:32,390 --> 03:07:33,390
Thank you, Dolores!

5394
03:07:33,610 --> 03:07:34,470
Thank you!

5395
03:07:36,310 --> 03:07:37,790
Second floor bathroom?

5396
03:07:38,390 --> 03:07:39,070
Oh!

5397
03:07:39,390 --> 03:07:40,970
No way!

5398
03:07:43,370 --> 03:07:44,790
Oh my god!

5399
03:07:45,150 --> 03:07:48,350
I fucking hate you so much!

5400
03:07:50,530 --> 03:07:51,970
Can you use your...

5401
03:07:57,980 --> 03:07:58,980
I don't...

5402
03:07:59,330 --> 03:08:00,120
Where am I?

5403
03:08:00,620 --> 03:08:01,460
Oh, I just...

5404
03:08:01,460 --> 03:08:02,360
Dolores just killed me.

5405
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:03,500
Oh!

5406
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:04,460
Oh my god!

5407
03:08:04,580 --> 03:08:05,400
She turned him back on!

5408
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:06,920
We didn't have to do anything!

5409
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:08,880
My head is so red right now.

5410
03:08:09,380 --> 03:08:10,000
It's okay.

5411
03:08:10,100 --> 03:08:10,580
It'll go away.

5412
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:13,580
We're in the safe room now.

5413
03:08:15,480 --> 03:08:17,760
That's the last mirror I think we have to break.

5414
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:29,200
Oh my god!

5415
03:08:29,320 --> 03:08:30,020
Now it's PT!

5416
03:08:31,560 --> 03:08:32,600
Now it's...

5417
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:33,300
Wait, go!

5418
03:08:33,480 --> 03:08:33,780
Turn...

5419
03:08:33,780 --> 03:08:34,780
There's a...

5420
03:08:34,780 --> 03:08:34,940
That?

5421
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:35,300
Yeah.

5422
03:08:35,980 --> 03:08:37,540
There's a cassette tape on the table.

5423
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:40,200
Okay.

5424
03:08:42,120 --> 03:08:42,640
Um...

5425
03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:44,280
Look up at the clocks above each hallway.

5426
03:08:44,500 --> 03:08:47,900
Go through the hallways in the order indicated by the baby monitor code.

5427
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:49,680
What?

5428
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:53,700
For example, five would be the hallway which displays five o'clock.

5429
03:08:54,060 --> 03:08:54,880
So that one.

5430
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:57,580
That's five o'clock.

5431
03:08:58,420 --> 03:08:58,940
Three...

5432
03:08:59,740 --> 03:09:00,260
Seven...

5433
03:09:00,260 --> 03:09:01,060
Did you go the right way?

5434
03:09:03,700 --> 03:09:04,220
Okay.

5435
03:09:04,820 --> 03:09:05,340
Five...

5436
03:09:05,340 --> 03:09:06,080
Zero?

5437
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:07,720
So then...

5438
03:09:07,720 --> 03:09:08,040
Midnight?

5439
03:09:08,300 --> 03:09:08,720
Right?

5440
03:09:09,120 --> 03:09:09,660
That one?

5441
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:11,140
Probably.

5442
03:09:11,960 --> 03:09:12,200
Yeah.

5443
03:09:15,180 --> 03:09:16,540
And then X is three.

5444
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:17,520
Three?

5445
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:18,020
There you are.

5446
03:09:18,060 --> 03:09:18,500
It's this one.

5447
03:09:18,500 --> 03:09:19,300
That one?

5448
03:09:19,500 --> 03:09:19,540
Yeah.

5449
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:20,080
Straight?

5450
03:09:20,420 --> 03:09:20,540
Yeah.

5451
03:09:21,260 --> 03:09:21,640
Wait, no.

5452
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:22,920
Yes.

5453
03:09:23,420 --> 03:09:24,160
And then seven.

5454
03:09:27,300 --> 03:09:27,980
Seven...

5455
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:28,760
That one.

5456
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:35,060
And then three.

5457
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:36,600
So straight.

5458
03:09:41,740 --> 03:09:42,660
There you go.

5459
03:09:47,260 --> 03:09:48,400
It's the baby.

5460
03:09:49,080 --> 03:09:50,820
It's just a fucking baby.

5461
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:52,860
Wow.

5462
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:53,980
Who recorded this?

5463
03:09:54,260 --> 03:09:55,000
Oh my God.

5464
03:09:55,220 --> 03:09:55,380
Sucks.

5465
03:09:55,780 --> 03:09:56,900
Who recorded it?

5466
03:10:01,540 --> 03:10:02,000
Holy...

5467
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:03,240
What the...

5468
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:07,980
Wow.

5469
03:10:08,400 --> 03:10:09,180
No touchy...

5470
03:10:09,180 --> 03:10:10,180
Wait, where am I?

5471
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:11,980
I'm back in the...

5472
03:10:11,980 --> 03:10:13,320
She stuck me in her womb?

5473
03:10:14,440 --> 03:10:14,840
Yep.

5474
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:16,200
We're going back, guys.

5475
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:17,180
Back where we belong.

5476
03:10:17,660 --> 03:10:18,860
We're gonna rock a pipe, baby.

5477
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:20,680
We're gonna get on board, guys.

5478
03:10:20,880 --> 03:10:21,300
Let's go.

5479
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:22,200
I'm free.

5480
03:10:24,180 --> 03:10:24,740
Oh my God.

5481
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:25,820
I can still hear the car.

5482
03:10:29,640 --> 03:10:30,660
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5483
03:10:30,800 --> 03:10:31,740
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

5484
03:10:32,840 --> 03:10:35,120
It says, take the crank from the phonograph.

5485
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:37,140
Wait, is there...

5486
03:10:37,140 --> 03:10:37,940
Where did the phonograph go?

5487
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:39,500
What do you mean?

5488
03:10:40,200 --> 03:10:41,180
There's a baby.

5489
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:42,120
Hello, baby.

5490
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:43,000
Yeah, hi, baby.

5491
03:10:43,420 --> 03:10:43,540
Yeah, hi, baby.

5492
03:10:43,540 --> 03:10:44,960
Okay, go down...

5493
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:47,360
Okay, go down the stairs and there will be the phonograph again.

5494
03:10:47,540 --> 03:10:47,880
Okay, never mind.

5495
03:10:47,960 --> 03:10:48,100
Sorry.

5496
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:49,720
Return to the womb.

5497
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:52,080
Return to the womb.

5498
03:10:52,640 --> 03:10:53,060
Yippee.

5499
03:10:53,620 --> 03:10:55,820
Wow, it's really cozy in here.

5500
03:10:55,980 --> 03:10:57,200
Very cozy in the womb.

5501
03:10:57,380 --> 03:10:58,340
Very nice and wet.

5502
03:11:00,780 --> 03:11:01,400
Yeah.

5503
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:02,500
Oh, squishy.

5504
03:11:03,320 --> 03:11:03,840
Yay.

5505
03:11:04,760 --> 03:11:05,880
I'm so lost now.

5506
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:07,440
Oh, this is the kitchen?

5507
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:08,200
Okay.

5508
03:11:08,820 --> 03:11:09,220
Okay.

5509
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:10,660
Are there meds in here?

5510
03:11:10,660 --> 03:11:10,740
No.

5511
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:12,640
The baby...

5512
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:14,140
The womb does not have beer anymore.

5513
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:15,040
Aww.

5514
03:11:16,700 --> 03:11:18,860
Do we really need meds anymore or...?

5515
03:11:18,860 --> 03:11:19,740
I don't know.

5516
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:21,420
I think we're beyond that, no?

5517
03:11:21,560 --> 03:11:22,540
I think we're beyond saving.

5518
03:11:22,540 --> 03:11:22,700
Oh, okay.

5519
03:11:22,700 --> 03:11:24,300
It says, follow the baby crying.

5520
03:11:33,830 --> 03:11:34,790
Hello, baby?

5521
03:11:35,710 --> 03:11:36,090
Baby.

5522
03:11:36,370 --> 03:11:36,390
Pepe?

5523
03:11:38,910 --> 03:11:39,650
Pepe, are you on...

5524
03:11:39,650 --> 03:11:39,990
It's in here?

5525
03:11:40,410 --> 03:11:40,930
Oh, there it is.

5526
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:42,070
Yeah, yeah, there it is.

5527
03:11:42,430 --> 03:11:42,870
Wow.

5528
03:11:43,350 --> 03:11:43,530
Wow.

5529
03:11:44,270 --> 03:11:45,490
The womb of hell.

5530
03:11:45,910 --> 03:11:46,350
Yippee.

5531
03:11:48,930 --> 03:11:50,250
I have to look at it.

5532
03:11:50,950 --> 03:11:52,190
Whoa, it's twitching.

5533
03:11:52,570 --> 03:11:53,050
Oh, it's like...

5534
03:11:53,050 --> 03:11:53,750
The baby's kicking!

5535
03:11:54,150 --> 03:11:54,330
Oh!

5536
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:56,370
She's gonna get birth soon!

5537
03:11:56,990 --> 03:11:57,650
Look at that!

5538
03:11:57,770 --> 03:11:58,750
The baby's kicking!

5539
03:11:59,790 --> 03:12:00,770
It's a boy!

5540
03:12:03,190 --> 03:12:06,050
Or maybe a girl, because they're cutting off all the womb of course.

5541
03:12:06,930 --> 03:12:08,150
Why would that make it a girl?

5542
03:12:13,730 --> 03:12:16,050
Every baby has an womb of course!

5543
03:12:16,050 --> 03:12:18,090
You know, you cut it too...

5544
03:12:18,090 --> 03:12:19,310
If you cut the...

5545
03:12:19,310 --> 03:12:20,650
Remove it fully, it's a girl!

5546
03:12:21,050 --> 03:12:22,250
Is that how it works?

5547
03:12:22,630 --> 03:12:23,890
Is that how...

5548
03:12:23,890 --> 03:12:25,330
Is that how it works, right?

5549
03:12:25,790 --> 03:12:26,770
Wait, where do I go after?

5550
03:12:26,770 --> 03:12:27,510
Okay, so now...

5551
03:12:27,510 --> 03:12:28,030
Hold on, hold on.

5552
03:12:28,130 --> 03:12:29,010
I'm trying to read it.

5553
03:12:29,790 --> 03:12:30,150
Uh...

5554
03:12:30,150 --> 03:12:32,490
Install the crank on the phonograph by the TV.

5555
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:35,210
That one, right there.

5556
03:12:35,290 --> 03:12:35,830
Oh, this one.

5557
03:12:36,610 --> 03:12:36,850
Yep.

5558
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:39,590
Oh my God...

5559
03:12:39,590 --> 03:12:42,370
And then like, if you leave a little bit, then it's a boy.

5560
03:12:42,610 --> 03:12:43,350
It's not how it works.

5561
03:12:43,690 --> 03:12:43,870
And...

5562
03:12:43,870 --> 03:12:49,970
And then we're gonna follow the umbilical cord to the progress room, and go back into the mirror.

5563
03:12:50,170 --> 03:12:50,870
Oh my God, seriously?

5564
03:12:50,870 --> 03:12:51,850
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

5565
03:12:52,090 --> 03:12:52,550
Are you...

5566
03:12:52,550 --> 03:12:54,570
Wait, so we gotta go all the way back upstairs?

5567
03:12:56,830 --> 03:12:57,230
Wait...

5568
03:12:57,910 --> 03:12:58,550
This one?

5569
03:12:59,030 --> 03:12:59,430
Yep.

5570
03:13:00,090 --> 03:13:00,970
Oh my god.

5571
03:13:00,970 --> 03:13:02,530
You can see how I wear it in my head.

5572
03:13:02,810 --> 03:13:04,610
My mind is so red right now.

5573
03:13:04,770 --> 03:13:06,650
Like, I'm not gonna be alive at this point.

5574
03:13:08,790 --> 03:13:09,910
Dolores, don't do it.

5575
03:13:10,150 --> 03:13:10,830
Dolores, please.

5576
03:13:11,770 --> 03:13:12,610
Dolores, don't do it.

5577
03:13:12,610 --> 03:13:13,510
Okay, and then where do I go?

5578
03:13:13,930 --> 03:13:15,130
To the progress room.

5579
03:13:15,390 --> 03:13:18,150
Oh my god, Dolores, you fucking bitch.

5580
03:13:21,070 --> 03:13:22,070
Oh my god.

5581
03:13:24,730 --> 03:13:27,070
So, you're going to the confessional, basically.

5582
03:13:28,570 --> 03:13:29,250
Okay.

5583
03:13:30,610 --> 03:13:32,470
Don't have my baby body.

5584
03:13:32,730 --> 03:13:33,310
Or, yeah.

5585
03:13:34,370 --> 03:13:38,010
Okay, yeah, just keep following the cord.

5586
03:13:40,970 --> 03:13:45,130
Okay, yeah, keep following the cord.

5587
03:13:45,590 --> 03:13:47,530
Oh my god, that's the baby.

5588
03:13:47,890 --> 03:13:49,590
Oh my god, the actual baby!

5589
03:13:49,830 --> 03:13:50,830
Oh my god.

5590
03:13:51,550 --> 03:13:53,090
Oh my god.

5591
03:13:53,850 --> 03:13:55,390
You fucking bitch.

5592
03:13:55,390 --> 03:13:58,110
This is actual baby safety.

5593
03:13:58,370 --> 03:13:59,590
You need to pick up the baby.

5594
03:13:59,830 --> 03:14:02,950
You gotta make sure your hand is, like, above the, uh, below the head.

5595
03:14:03,230 --> 03:14:03,970
To keep the head safe.

5596
03:14:03,970 --> 03:14:04,970
It's cradling, it's cranium.

5597
03:14:06,030 --> 03:14:07,290
Oh god, he turned gray.

5598
03:14:07,650 --> 03:14:09,450
I'm gonna take you to the confessional.

5599
03:14:10,110 --> 03:14:11,450
Yeah, take him to the confessional.

5600
03:14:11,930 --> 03:14:13,510
I'm gonna baptize you, baby.

5601
03:14:15,210 --> 03:14:16,810
No, not here, the confessional.

5602
03:14:17,130 --> 03:14:17,310
Oh.

5603
03:14:17,990 --> 03:14:18,830
This one right here.

5604
03:14:19,130 --> 03:14:20,590
I don't know how you would know this.

5605
03:14:20,710 --> 03:14:21,370
I have no idea.

5606
03:14:21,730 --> 03:14:22,090
What?

5607
03:14:23,290 --> 03:14:25,250
Oh, here, I just chuck him in here?

5608
03:14:27,530 --> 03:14:31,690
It says, pick up the baby from the crib, bring it back to Dolores in the confessional.

5609
03:14:31,870 --> 03:14:32,850
That's what it says to me.

5610
03:14:33,090 --> 03:14:34,190
And watch the cutscene.

5611
03:14:35,270 --> 03:14:36,170
That's what it says to me.

5612
03:14:36,170 --> 03:14:38,350
I equip the, I equip the baby.

5613
03:14:39,390 --> 03:14:40,530
Can I drop the baby?

5614
03:14:40,530 --> 03:14:40,890
It's not looking so good.

5615
03:14:41,050 --> 03:14:41,290
Can I?

5616
03:14:41,330 --> 03:14:44,190
Look, he, he looks so old.

5617
03:14:44,450 --> 03:14:45,950
You should keep this with you for now.

5618
03:14:46,350 --> 03:14:48,350
I wanted to drop the baby.

5619
03:14:50,170 --> 03:14:52,070
I'll, uh, yeet the baby inside.

5620
03:14:52,570 --> 03:14:53,930
The, what, how do you do this?

5621
03:14:54,090 --> 03:14:54,890
I'll give it to her.

5622
03:14:55,230 --> 03:14:57,090
The baby goes into the square hole.

5623
03:14:57,570 --> 03:14:58,170
Just actually.

5624
03:14:58,450 --> 03:14:58,730
Yeah.

5625
03:14:59,730 --> 03:15:01,850
Why doesn't she take the baby?

5626
03:15:02,550 --> 03:15:03,930
Dolores, don't you want the baby?

5627
03:15:04,910 --> 03:15:07,490
Dolores, take your goddamn fucking baby!

5628
03:15:09,790 --> 03:15:12,170
Uh, let me look up another guide.

5629
03:15:12,510 --> 03:15:15,930
I tried to take your stupid fucking baby!

5630
03:15:19,890 --> 03:15:21,010
Uh, uh...

5631
03:15:21,010 --> 03:15:21,950
Oh my god.

5632
03:15:22,070 --> 03:15:23,430
Hold on, I have to, I have to...

5633
03:15:23,430 --> 03:15:26,150
I'll stay in the womb, I'll stay in the...

5634
03:15:28,070 --> 03:15:28,630
Um...

5635
03:15:28,630 --> 03:15:29,890
She can't get me in here.

5636
03:15:30,150 --> 03:15:32,030
I got the baby with me.

5637
03:15:32,450 --> 03:15:33,410
What the hell?

5638
03:15:33,410 --> 03:15:35,590
Oh, next cha- What?

5639
03:15:36,050 --> 03:15:37,450
No, I'm in Dolores' chapter.

5640
03:15:37,910 --> 03:15:38,950
Why isn't it...

5641
03:15:38,950 --> 03:15:40,650
It doesn't even talk about the baby.

5642
03:15:40,970 --> 03:15:41,150
Wait.

5643
03:15:41,330 --> 03:15:41,510
What?

5644
03:15:41,890 --> 03:15:42,910
What am I...

5645
03:15:43,410 --> 03:15:44,410
I'm just...

5646
03:15:45,290 --> 03:15:47,250
Hold on, I'm re- I'm trying to read!

5647
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:47,690
What?

5648
03:15:48,530 --> 03:15:50,130
Drop the baby!

5649
03:15:51,970 --> 03:15:54,410
I tried to drop him!

5650
03:15:54,790 --> 03:15:57,150
Go back in your crib, little baby!

5651
03:15:57,150 --> 03:15:58,530
Go back!

5652
03:15:58,710 --> 03:16:00,370
I don't want you no more!

5653
03:16:00,950 --> 03:16:01,410
I...

5654
03:16:05,210 --> 03:16:05,890
What?

5655
03:16:09,050 --> 03:16:10,310
B- Baby?

5656
03:16:11,150 --> 03:16:12,310
I don't want...

5657
03:16:12,310 --> 03:16:13,450
I don't want to...

5658
03:16:13,450 --> 03:16:14,910
I don't want a baby!

5659
03:16:17,030 --> 03:16:17,710
I...

5660
03:16:17,710 --> 03:16:17,990
I...

5661
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:19,370
I don't know.

5662
03:16:19,470 --> 03:16:20,550
I don't know what to do.

5663
03:16:22,050 --> 03:16:23,270
I have no idea.

5664
03:16:24,270 --> 03:16:26,230
She's in the mirror room?

5665
03:16:26,770 --> 03:16:29,930
Where the fuck is the mirror room?

5666
03:16:30,070 --> 03:16:32,050
I have a baby in my hand!

5667
03:16:33,790 --> 03:16:34,930
Mirror room?

5668
03:16:36,230 --> 03:16:38,190
The one on the first floor?

5669
03:16:38,770 --> 03:16:40,770
Why does it say confessional, then?

5670
03:16:40,910 --> 03:16:44,330
In this... I have no idea.

5671
03:16:45,210 --> 03:16:45,830
Where's the...?

5672
03:16:46,870 --> 03:16:48,930
Go to the living room through?

5673
03:16:49,670 --> 03:16:50,670
Oh my god.

5674
03:16:53,030 --> 03:16:55,230
Where... Where is that?

5675
03:17:01,230 --> 03:17:03,570
Oh my god.

5676
03:17:04,070 --> 03:17:05,090
Oh, come on.

5677
03:17:06,170 --> 03:17:10,370
Oh my god.

5678
03:17:14,130 --> 03:17:15,850
I can still hear the car.

5679
03:17:16,010 --> 03:17:17,430
I can still hear the car.

5680
03:17:17,430 --> 03:17:18,770
I can still hear the car.

5681
03:17:18,770 --> 03:17:20,270
It's taking me out.

5682
03:17:20,550 --> 03:17:22,550
Oh, the confessional in here?

5683
03:17:22,850 --> 03:17:23,430
Oh, wow.

5684
03:17:23,810 --> 03:17:24,050
Okay.

5685
03:17:24,850 --> 03:17:26,210
I think she's in there.

5686
03:17:26,430 --> 03:17:28,370
I think you give it to her in the hole.

5687
03:17:28,710 --> 03:17:29,810
The square hole.

5688
03:17:30,130 --> 03:17:30,830
The square hole.

5689
03:17:31,030 --> 03:17:32,390
Here's the square hole.

5690
03:17:33,250 --> 03:17:36,090
The baby goes in the square hole.

5691
03:17:36,530 --> 03:17:36,770
Square hole.

5692
03:17:49,500 --> 03:17:50,880
You are forgiven.

5693
03:17:51,540 --> 03:17:52,320
Oh no.

5694
03:17:52,320 --> 03:17:53,900
I don't think she is.

5695
03:17:57,760 --> 03:17:59,000
Where did... Oh my god.

5696
03:17:59,460 --> 03:18:00,440
He came from heaven.

5697
03:18:00,840 --> 03:18:01,400
Oh my god.

5698
03:18:02,620 --> 03:18:02,960
Okay.

5699
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:05,960
Now... Uh... Yes.

5700
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:06,380
You did it.

5701
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:09,180
Uh... That was the moon mobile.

5702
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:12,980
Then we can go to... Wait.

5703
03:18:13,160 --> 03:18:13,240
Okay.

5704
03:18:13,240 --> 03:18:14,760
Note that you have... Have... Wait.

5705
03:18:15,080 --> 03:18:18,680
Note that you must have completed all ten puzzles before you can start this one.

5706
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:20,320
Head to the parents' room.

5707
03:18:20,420 --> 03:18:21,940
Place the mobile toys on the...

5708
03:18:21,940 --> 03:18:22,340
crib.

5709
03:18:22,340 --> 03:18:22,440
Crib.

5710
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:24,520
Oh my god.

5711
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:29,600
And that will give us the key to open the last... That door in the basement that we couldn't before.

5712
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:31,960
Oh my god.

5713
03:18:32,780 --> 03:18:32,980
Yeah.

5714
03:18:34,020 --> 03:18:36,980
Then we can... Oh my god.

5715
03:18:37,300 --> 03:18:38,160
Someone's at the door.

5716
03:18:41,740 --> 03:18:42,340
Rude.

5717
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:45,020
That's my delivery.

5718
03:18:45,700 --> 03:18:47,580
That's my pizza.

5719
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:53,200
My head's not okay.

5720
03:18:53,620 --> 03:18:55,000
My head is not okay.

5721
03:18:55,020 --> 03:18:55,620
It's fine.

5722
03:18:55,620 --> 03:18:56,300
My head.

5723
03:18:56,540 --> 03:18:57,420
It's full red.

5724
03:18:57,620 --> 03:18:58,460
It's full red.

5725
03:18:58,460 --> 03:18:58,520
It's fine.

5726
03:18:58,640 --> 03:19:00,420
We're about to go... We're about to go into the room.

5727
03:19:00,500 --> 03:19:01,260
We're about to go into the room.

5728
03:19:01,260 --> 03:19:01,640
It's fine.

5729
03:19:01,960 --> 03:19:02,280
It's full red.

5730
03:19:02,460 --> 03:19:02,620
It's full red.

5731
03:19:02,620 --> 03:19:02,760
It's full red.

5732
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:03,640
We're about to go into the room.

5733
03:19:03,760 --> 03:19:04,860
We're about to go into the room.

5734
03:19:05,060 --> 03:19:05,640
Go in here.

5735
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:07,360
See?

5736
03:19:07,500 --> 03:19:07,900
We're fine now.

5737
03:19:08,320 --> 03:19:08,520
Okay.

5738
03:19:09,200 --> 03:19:10,200
And now put that on.

5739
03:19:11,540 --> 03:19:13,360
And then... What do you mean you can't use that here?

5740
03:19:13,480 --> 03:19:14,420
Shut the hell up here.

5741
03:19:19,580 --> 03:19:19,580
Okay.

5742
03:19:21,220 --> 03:19:22,240
Do I spin it?

5743
03:19:22,900 --> 03:19:23,360
Oh.

5744
03:19:23,840 --> 03:19:24,420
Oh, there we go.

5745
03:19:24,540 --> 03:19:24,940
Okay, cool.

5746
03:19:25,700 --> 03:19:29,360
Oh my god, I was about to say... How did anyone... How did anyone beat this?

5747
03:19:29,820 --> 03:19:30,960
I don't know!

5748
03:19:31,400 --> 03:19:32,960
How did anyone beat this?

5749
03:19:34,580 --> 03:19:36,320
What is this contraption?

5750
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:41,620
Oh my god, I swear to god, I was like, if it made me go somewhere else, I swear to god.

5751
03:19:43,220 --> 03:19:50,840
If I had to go anywhere else in this godforsaken house, I swear to fucking god.

5752
03:19:51,560 --> 03:19:51,880
Okay.

5753
03:19:52,520 --> 03:19:53,260
Now...

5754
03:19:53,260 --> 03:19:53,660
Alright.

5755
03:19:53,960 --> 03:19:54,640
Go open that.

5756
03:19:55,440 --> 03:19:57,240
Alright, I open this now.

5757
03:19:58,720 --> 03:19:59,460
Nice.

5758
03:20:02,680 --> 03:20:03,860
Vinyl disc.

5759
03:20:04,800 --> 03:20:05,260
No.

5760
03:20:05,480 --> 03:20:06,000
Wait.

5761
03:20:06,320 --> 03:20:06,900
No.

5762
03:20:09,180 --> 03:20:09,940
No.

5763
03:20:10,680 --> 03:20:12,800
No, it's not open.

5764
03:20:13,020 --> 03:20:17,940
Oh yeah, we gotta go to the, um, the basement and use the phonograph down there.

5765
03:20:19,020 --> 03:20:19,920
What's wrong?

5766
03:20:21,460 --> 03:20:24,220
I have to go to the fucking basement!

5767
03:20:24,220 --> 03:20:24,500
Yes!

5768
03:20:24,740 --> 03:20:24,860
What?

5769
03:20:25,260 --> 03:20:27,340
That's where the last door is anyway!

5770
03:20:27,920 --> 03:20:29,160
You had to go there anyway!

5771
03:20:32,480 --> 03:20:35,780
Man, I am not sane right now.

5772
03:20:36,060 --> 03:20:36,500
I'm...

5773
03:20:36,500 --> 03:20:37,660
Man, my...

5774
03:20:37,660 --> 03:20:40,780
My head is not okay anymore.

5775
03:20:41,660 --> 03:20:43,160
Can you turn any of the lights on?

5776
03:20:44,660 --> 03:20:46,200
Or did she actually flip the brake?

5777
03:20:46,300 --> 03:20:47,580
No, she flipped everything.

5778
03:20:47,840 --> 03:20:48,860
There's nothing left.

5779
03:20:49,560 --> 03:20:49,880
Okay.

5780
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:51,620
We'll just run, I guess.

5781
03:20:51,740 --> 03:20:52,040
I don't know.

5782
03:20:52,900 --> 03:20:53,660
Oh, I don't know.

5783
03:20:53,720 --> 03:20:54,480
Just run again.

5784
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:55,500
I don't know.

5785
03:20:57,140 --> 03:20:58,740
The car still is on.

5786
03:21:01,240 --> 03:21:02,380
You're good.

5787
03:21:02,940 --> 03:21:03,360
Wee!

5788
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:06,700
Wee!

5789
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:08,120
Wee!

5790
03:21:09,320 --> 03:21:10,320
Wee!

5791
03:21:10,320 --> 03:21:10,620
Wee!

5792
03:21:11,940 --> 03:21:12,560
Wee!

5793
03:21:16,520 --> 03:21:17,140
Wee!

5794
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:18,340
Wee!

5795
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:18,580
Wee!

5796
03:21:19,960 --> 03:21:20,580
Wee!

5797
03:21:20,740 --> 03:21:21,360
Wee!

5798
03:21:23,030 --> 03:21:25,000
We make our own fun, you guys.

5799
03:21:28,540 --> 03:21:29,160
Nice.

5800
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:29,780
Alright.

5801
03:21:32,120 --> 03:21:32,740
Okay.

5802
03:21:32,960 --> 03:21:33,760
Now to the phonograph.

5803
03:21:33,960 --> 03:21:35,000
That's right next to the TV.

5804
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:35,120
We?

5805
03:21:36,640 --> 03:21:39,740
I bet you I'm gonna get, like, shanked by someone here.

5806
03:21:40,100 --> 03:21:41,100
There's no way.

5807
03:21:42,180 --> 03:21:43,820
There's no way we're freed.

5808
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:45,220
We're here.

5809
03:21:45,900 --> 03:21:46,460
Alright.

5810
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:48,240
Okay.

5811
03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:52,400
You can use it to play music.

5812
03:21:53,840 --> 03:21:54,940
Or music.

5813
03:21:56,900 --> 03:21:57,540
Alright.

5814
03:21:57,900 --> 03:21:58,980
Oh, that scared me.

5815
03:21:59,660 --> 03:22:00,220
Now what?

5816
03:22:02,580 --> 03:22:03,220
Um...

5817
03:22:03,220 --> 03:22:04,240
Uh, listen to...

5818
03:22:04,740 --> 03:22:07,400
Hear the music begin playing from the mirror next to the electrical room.

5819
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:08,580
So that mirror right there.

5820
03:22:08,840 --> 03:22:10,060
The one that I, you know.

5821
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:14,280
Follow the sound and you will reach an area...

5822
03:22:14,280 --> 03:22:17,600
With a web of concrete stairs going in all directions.

5823
03:22:19,180 --> 03:22:19,660
Okay.

5824
03:22:19,880 --> 03:22:21,140
Follow the sound of the music.

5825
03:22:21,380 --> 03:22:24,520
But if you hear growling, you're going the wrong way.

5826
03:22:29,850 --> 03:22:30,810
That was nice.

5827
03:22:30,810 --> 03:22:31,570
I like this one.

5828
03:22:35,660 --> 03:22:36,460
Is this right?

5829
03:22:36,460 --> 03:22:36,480
Okay.

5830
03:22:37,580 --> 03:22:37,740
Oh.

5831
03:22:38,400 --> 03:22:39,040
You're growling?

5832
03:22:39,080 --> 03:22:39,600
Yeah, me too.

5833
03:22:43,120 --> 03:22:44,260
It's like down there.

5834
03:22:44,460 --> 03:22:45,540
It's like, yeah, down there.

5835
03:22:48,820 --> 03:22:49,460
Where's down?

5836
03:22:50,140 --> 03:22:51,400
Oh, there was down on...

5837
03:22:51,400 --> 03:22:52,300
You were heading towards it.

5838
03:22:52,380 --> 03:22:52,820
See right there?

5839
03:22:53,020 --> 03:22:54,160
You gotta cross over though.

5840
03:22:54,620 --> 03:22:54,760
No.

5841
03:22:56,960 --> 03:22:58,340
I guess you can go this way too, yeah?

5842
03:22:58,420 --> 03:22:59,080
Yeah, the thing is.

5843
03:22:59,200 --> 03:22:59,520
This way.

5844
03:23:03,540 --> 03:23:04,440
That was me.

5845
03:23:04,660 --> 03:23:05,140
Could you tell?

5846
03:23:05,360 --> 03:23:06,520
Yeah, your stomach, yeah.

5847
03:23:07,580 --> 03:23:07,760
Oh.

5848
03:23:08,120 --> 03:23:09,320
You're going the wrong way.

5849
03:23:12,620 --> 03:23:13,100
Um.

5850
03:23:14,060 --> 03:23:14,540
Uh.

5851
03:23:15,760 --> 03:23:16,240
Uh.

5852
03:23:16,240 --> 03:23:16,560
Um.

5853
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:18,580
Where'd the music go?

5854
03:23:20,940 --> 03:23:21,420
Um.

5855
03:23:22,420 --> 03:23:23,140
Where's the music?

5856
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:24,600
Oh.

5857
03:23:24,920 --> 03:23:25,400
Um.

5858
03:23:26,400 --> 03:23:26,700
Uh.

5859
03:23:27,340 --> 03:23:27,760
Oh.

5860
03:23:28,060 --> 03:23:28,220
Oh.

5861
03:23:28,220 --> 03:23:28,280
Oh.

5862
03:23:28,880 --> 03:23:29,320
Oh.

5863
03:23:29,320 --> 03:23:29,360
Oh.

5864
03:23:29,360 --> 03:23:29,380
Oh.

5865
03:23:36,520 --> 03:23:37,080
Oops.

5866
03:23:37,280 --> 03:23:37,580
Oops.

5867
03:23:38,180 --> 03:23:38,440
Oops.

5868
03:23:42,620 --> 03:23:43,180
Oops.

5869
03:23:43,180 --> 03:23:43,200
Oh.

5870
03:23:43,280 --> 03:23:43,800
You can fall?

5871
03:23:45,440 --> 03:23:46,560
Sounds like it.

5872
03:23:50,140 --> 03:23:50,700
Okay.

5873
03:23:51,280 --> 03:23:52,040
Oh my god.

5874
03:23:52,100 --> 03:23:53,140
How far are we?

5875
03:23:53,240 --> 03:23:54,340
How far are we?

5876
03:23:54,340 --> 03:23:56,120
This is... After this?

5877
03:23:56,280 --> 03:23:56,900
After this?

5878
03:23:56,900 --> 03:23:57,960
It's basically the end.

5879
03:23:58,580 --> 03:23:59,900
No, but how... Oh my god, okay.

5880
03:24:00,020 --> 03:24:00,820
It's back to the door.

5881
03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:01,280
Oh, okay.

5882
03:24:01,400 --> 03:24:01,600
Yeah, yeah.

5883
03:24:01,740 --> 03:24:02,080
Thank goodness.

5884
03:24:02,920 --> 03:24:03,020
Okay.

5885
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:11,580
Turn around!

5886
03:24:13,540 --> 03:24:14,120
Uh-oh.

5887
03:24:14,560 --> 03:24:15,000
Uh-oh.

5888
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:18,380
Just kill yourself, I guess.

5889
03:24:19,060 --> 03:24:19,840
Kill yourself!

5890
03:24:20,060 --> 03:24:20,580
Kill yourself!

5891
03:24:32,280 --> 03:24:34,600
It doesn't even let you... It doesn't even let you...

5892
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:36,540
I thought it didn't even let you... It doesn't even let you...

5893
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:38,180
It doesn't let you correct it.

5894
03:24:38,440 --> 03:24:39,440
It's so messed up.

5895
03:24:39,860 --> 03:24:40,780
It's not my fault.

5896
03:24:40,880 --> 03:24:41,820
It didn't correct itself.

5897
03:24:42,720 --> 03:24:43,240
Yeah.

5898
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:45,560
Okay.

5899
03:24:45,960 --> 03:24:46,260
Okay.

5900
03:24:57,770 --> 03:24:58,970
Wait, what's in that window?

5901
03:24:59,230 --> 03:24:59,670
Oh my god.

5902
03:24:59,790 --> 03:25:00,770
Got the growling already.

5903
03:25:01,390 --> 03:25:02,030
No, turn around!

5904
03:25:02,250 --> 03:25:03,270
You're going the wrong way!

5905
03:25:04,050 --> 03:25:04,970
It's here.

5906
03:25:06,970 --> 03:25:07,570
Clearly not!

5907
03:25:07,790 --> 03:25:08,650
We're going the wrong way!

5908
03:25:09,190 --> 03:25:10,810
But it played the happy music.

5909
03:25:11,610 --> 03:25:12,690
It's not anymore!

5910
03:25:17,030 --> 03:25:19,050
What happened to all the happy music?

5911
03:25:21,510 --> 03:25:22,150
Okay.

5912
03:25:24,390 --> 03:25:26,370
I'm a little lost.

5913
03:25:27,510 --> 03:25:28,470
Maybe I have to...

5914
03:25:28,470 --> 03:25:30,970
Go back to where you came from.

5915
03:25:34,770 --> 03:25:36,370
Why does it sound like...

5916
03:25:38,110 --> 03:25:40,070
Why did all the happy music go away?

5917
03:25:40,330 --> 03:25:41,130
Oh, there it is.

5918
03:25:41,310 --> 03:25:41,410
Oh.

5919
03:25:44,930 --> 03:25:46,070
Alright, to the left.

5920
03:25:51,680 --> 03:25:53,040
I think it's...

5921
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:54,540
That door over there.

5922
03:25:55,820 --> 03:25:56,780
Do you see it?

5923
03:25:57,880 --> 03:25:58,620
Which one?

5924
03:25:59,320 --> 03:26:01,660
The one in front of you, but it's down a little.

5925
03:26:05,640 --> 03:26:06,740
Oh, maybe it's here.

5926
03:26:08,280 --> 03:26:09,160
Maybe I was wrong.

5927
03:26:11,540 --> 03:26:14,900
No, I think it's still a little...

5928
03:26:18,540 --> 03:26:20,680
How do we get there?

5929
03:26:21,820 --> 03:26:23,060
You just keep going around.

5930
03:26:23,240 --> 03:26:24,220
Like, maybe that one up there.

5931
03:26:31,420 --> 03:26:32,700
Maybe that one up there.

5932
03:26:32,860 --> 03:26:33,140
I don't know.

5933
03:26:33,380 --> 03:26:33,720
Right here?

5934
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:35,880
You see that?

5935
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:36,880
Yeah, that one up there.

5936
03:26:37,160 --> 03:26:37,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5937
03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:39,260
Alright, we gotta...

5938
03:26:39,260 --> 03:26:41,560
Figure out those stairs right there.

5939
03:26:44,480 --> 03:26:46,060
I can't with this growling.

5940
03:26:46,720 --> 03:26:47,040
It's here.

5941
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:48,620
We drop down and then we go up.

5942
03:26:49,280 --> 03:26:49,800
Yeah, do it.

5943
03:26:54,120 --> 03:26:55,000
Should be, right?

5944
03:26:55,360 --> 03:26:56,500
I think you're right, yeah.

5945
03:26:59,200 --> 03:26:59,640
There's...

5946
03:26:59,640 --> 03:26:59,980
What?

5947
03:27:03,280 --> 03:27:04,660
Why is it like this?

5948
03:27:05,420 --> 03:27:06,560
I think I should not have dropped down.

5949
03:27:06,560 --> 03:27:07,400
Is it bugged?

5950
03:27:09,300 --> 03:27:10,260
No way.

5951
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:13,560
Um...

5952
03:27:13,560 --> 03:27:15,340
Yeah, I don't think I should have dropped down.

5953
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:18,460
Why does it sound like it's pooping itself?

5954
03:27:19,560 --> 03:27:20,520
Where am I?

5955
03:27:20,660 --> 03:27:21,360
Oh my god.

5956
03:27:22,340 --> 03:27:23,600
Where am I?

5957
03:27:23,620 --> 03:27:25,760
Can you try opening it anyway?

5958
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:27,100
I don't know.

5959
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:29,020
I fuck up.

5960
03:27:30,280 --> 03:27:31,300
But we're gonna drop here.

5961
03:27:31,800 --> 03:27:32,440
Yeah, drop there.

5962
03:27:32,960 --> 03:27:33,220
Oh.

5963
03:27:34,140 --> 03:27:34,600
Okay.

5964
03:27:40,840 --> 03:27:41,300
What?

5965
03:27:42,240 --> 03:27:42,920
Try it.

5966
03:27:44,100 --> 03:27:45,540
What's the harm in opening it anyway?

5967
03:27:45,700 --> 03:27:46,760
It won't let me open it.

5968
03:27:47,120 --> 03:27:47,500
Oh, okay.

5969
03:27:47,840 --> 03:27:48,140
Then...

5970
03:27:48,140 --> 03:27:48,580
Maybe here?

5971
03:27:59,640 --> 03:28:00,560
Hold on!

5972
03:28:05,860 --> 03:28:06,900
Can we go down?

5973
03:28:09,020 --> 03:28:10,560
I don't think so.

5974
03:28:10,660 --> 03:28:12,260
I think we'll go further away from it, huh?

5975
03:28:15,300 --> 03:28:15,880
I don't think so.

5976
03:28:15,880 --> 03:28:16,120
Not great.

5977
03:28:17,920 --> 03:28:19,780
Yeah, but it sounds so far away.

5978
03:28:23,060 --> 03:28:24,440
Like it's definitely tarp...

5979
03:28:24,440 --> 03:28:24,440
Oh.

5980
03:28:24,740 --> 03:28:24,760
Oh.

5981
03:28:35,560 --> 03:28:36,420
We're done!

5982
03:28:37,700 --> 03:28:38,800
Wait, someone said...

5983
03:28:38,800 --> 03:28:40,640
As long as you can hear it, it's the right way.

5984
03:28:41,380 --> 03:28:41,820
Okay.

5985
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:43,120
Okay.

5986
03:28:43,120 --> 03:28:43,200
Okay.

5987
03:28:44,600 --> 03:28:45,820
So just keep going...

5988
03:28:46,820 --> 03:28:48,360
Wait, we just went this way.

5989
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:50,800
Yeah, but there's no other doors this way.

5990
03:28:51,560 --> 03:28:52,580
Unless it's this way?

5991
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:53,160
You see that?

5992
03:28:53,360 --> 03:28:54,480
Is that staircase lead over there?

5993
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:56,200
Oh, we can try it?

5994
03:28:58,160 --> 03:28:58,600
Yeah.

5995
03:29:06,200 --> 03:29:06,640
Okay.

5996
03:29:06,880 --> 03:29:07,360
Try this one.

5997
03:29:08,180 --> 03:29:08,460
No?

5998
03:29:09,060 --> 03:29:09,340
No.

5999
03:29:09,340 --> 03:29:10,500
Get her.

6000
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:11,440
Get her.

6001
03:29:16,040 --> 03:29:16,740
Oh.

6002
03:29:17,890 --> 03:29:18,700
Wrong way!

6003
03:29:19,340 --> 03:29:19,740
Okay.

6004
03:29:21,700 --> 03:29:22,860
Oh my god.

6005
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:24,280
This is...

6006
03:29:24,280 --> 03:29:24,880
This is like...

6007
03:29:24,880 --> 03:29:26,800
This is like hot and cold right now.

6008
03:29:27,280 --> 03:29:27,720
I know!

6009
03:29:32,380 --> 03:29:33,110
Wrong way!

6010
03:29:33,110 --> 03:29:35,090
Are we gonna get DMC'd?

6011
03:29:35,930 --> 03:29:37,250
I'm pretty sure it's classical.

6012
03:29:38,490 --> 03:29:39,410
Some people...

6013
03:29:39,410 --> 03:29:39,750
Wait.

6014
03:29:39,970 --> 03:29:40,210
Wait.

6015
03:29:41,650 --> 03:29:42,990
Oh, it's growling.

6016
03:29:43,150 --> 03:29:43,510
It's growling.

6017
03:29:45,810 --> 03:29:46,490
What?

6018
03:29:46,490 --> 03:29:47,270
This is the only way.

6019
03:29:48,450 --> 03:29:49,270
Go here?

6020
03:29:49,270 --> 03:29:50,730
You're gonna step on that.

6021
03:29:50,870 --> 03:29:51,890
And he's gonna growl at you.

6022
03:29:53,630 --> 03:29:56,450
Some people still claim classical music, you guys.

6023
03:29:56,750 --> 03:29:57,050
Oh, that's true.

6024
03:29:57,150 --> 03:29:58,010
Because it's the orchestra.

6025
03:29:58,730 --> 03:29:59,510
Some people, yeah.

6026
03:29:59,710 --> 03:30:00,190
They'll like...

6027
03:30:00,190 --> 03:30:00,630
Is it here?

6028
03:30:00,630 --> 03:30:02,790
People will just register whatever the hell they want.

6029
03:30:03,010 --> 03:30:03,310
And say...

6030
03:30:04,490 --> 03:30:06,330
The right door is not against the walls.

6031
03:30:06,330 --> 03:30:07,930
There was a path I missed?

6032
03:30:10,590 --> 03:30:11,950
But it didn't grow at me.

6033
03:30:12,570 --> 03:30:15,090
Yeah, we've been going the right way this whole time, apparently.

6034
03:30:15,830 --> 03:30:16,230
Unless...

6035
03:30:16,230 --> 03:30:16,490
That one?

6036
03:30:16,630 --> 03:30:16,890
Right there?

6037
03:30:19,630 --> 03:30:20,190
Nope.

6038
03:30:20,350 --> 03:30:20,730
Nope.

6039
03:30:21,010 --> 03:30:21,570
It's like...

6040
03:30:23,330 --> 03:30:23,890
What?

6041
03:30:24,170 --> 03:30:25,630
It ain't grow when I'm here.

6042
03:30:27,630 --> 03:30:29,210
Yeah, this seems correct.

6043
03:30:29,990 --> 03:30:31,710
Okay, but like...

6044
03:30:31,710 --> 03:30:32,830
We go this way?

6045
03:30:34,610 --> 03:30:35,710
Or this way?

6046
03:30:35,830 --> 03:30:36,410
I don't know.

6047
03:30:37,150 --> 03:30:38,130
I don't know.

6048
03:30:42,520 --> 03:30:43,100
I don't know.

6049
03:30:43,500 --> 03:30:45,160
Yeah, so far so good.

6050
03:30:45,640 --> 03:30:46,360
So far so good.

6051
03:30:46,840 --> 03:30:47,240
Okay.

6052
03:30:47,580 --> 03:30:47,840
Alright.

6053
03:30:48,700 --> 03:30:49,140
Alright.

6054
03:30:50,160 --> 03:30:50,960
Okay.

6055
03:30:51,120 --> 03:30:52,080
So far so good.

6056
03:30:52,560 --> 03:30:52,580
Okay.

6057
03:30:52,980 --> 03:30:53,100
Just keep going.

6058
03:30:56,750 --> 03:30:58,430
Is there anything in there?

6059
03:30:59,370 --> 03:30:59,870
Oh!

6060
03:31:04,670 --> 03:31:05,670
Try it.

6061
03:31:07,390 --> 03:31:07,790
Hello?

6062
03:31:07,930 --> 03:31:08,250
Yeah!

6063
03:31:09,810 --> 03:31:11,210
Oh my god.

6064
03:31:14,630 --> 03:31:16,650
We're in- We're in the- We're in the room.

6065
03:31:16,650 --> 03:31:17,050
We're in.

6066
03:31:17,050 --> 03:31:17,590
Oh My God.

6067
03:31:17,810 --> 03:31:18,010
We're in the room.

6068
03:31:18,470 --> 03:31:18,830
We're in!

6069
03:31:19,690 --> 03:31:20,370
Wee!

6070
03:31:23,850 --> 03:31:24,530
Wee!

6071
03:31:25,050 --> 03:31:32,640
Oh my God, they finally upgraded our- Wee!

6072
03:31:33,420 --> 03:31:33,820
Wee!

6073
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:34,600
Wee!

6074
03:31:37,020 --> 03:31:37,700
Wee!

6075
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:40,200
Oh, we're back in the dirty womb.

6076
03:31:40,880 --> 03:31:42,480
I can see why this was the scariest level.

6077
03:31:42,560 --> 03:31:45,160
Because it actually is just the most nonsensical.

6078
03:31:45,300 --> 03:31:48,600
Yeah, there's like a lot of psychological shit going on here.

6079
03:31:49,080 --> 03:31:52,020
I don't feel psycholog... I feel like I've taken mental damage.

6080
03:31:52,180 --> 03:31:54,540
Oh my god, the cartolitis is still going.

6081
03:31:55,620 --> 03:31:57,560
Oh my god.

6082
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:02,620
Hello?

6083
03:32:04,180 --> 03:32:04,700
People!

6084
03:32:08,360 --> 03:32:10,300
I'm so sad.

6085
03:32:12,700 --> 03:32:14,800
I'm so sad.

6086
03:32:15,060 --> 03:32:15,700
People!

6087
03:32:16,860 --> 03:32:18,540
Oh, there she is.

6088
03:32:19,220 --> 03:32:19,960
Dolores!

6089
03:32:20,180 --> 03:32:20,920
Dolores!

6090
03:32:21,460 --> 03:32:22,860
Hello, Dolores.

6091
03:32:24,080 --> 03:32:24,800
Hello.

6092
03:32:25,760 --> 03:32:26,060
Hi.

6093
03:32:26,640 --> 03:32:27,020
Hi.

6094
03:32:29,240 --> 03:32:31,140
She's going to stick her finger in there.

6095
03:32:32,080 --> 03:32:33,080
I'm not allowed to see it.

6096
03:32:33,320 --> 03:32:34,520
JK, I have this area.

6097
03:32:35,420 --> 03:32:36,460
Hello, Dolores.

6098
03:32:37,100 --> 03:32:38,660
I can watch from here, too.

6099
03:32:41,720 --> 03:32:43,000
Oh, she's got the baby.

6100
03:32:43,280 --> 03:32:44,220
Oh, she has the baby.

6101
03:32:44,640 --> 03:32:46,380
I stuck it into the square hole.

6102
03:32:46,520 --> 03:32:47,220
Now she's happy.

6103
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:52,180
Peeping on the grandma.

6104
03:33:04,320 --> 03:33:05,300
Peepo, Peepo, Peepo.

6105
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:08,000
See, the Peepo is the best part of the chapter.

6106
03:33:08,620 --> 03:33:10,420
I told you, all things lead to Peepo.

6107
03:33:13,580 --> 03:33:14,180
Oh.

6108
03:33:18,260 --> 03:33:19,080
Why'd she...

6109
03:33:19,080 --> 03:33:19,280
Why?

6110
03:33:19,740 --> 03:33:20,420
Grandma, why?

6111
03:33:20,860 --> 03:33:21,820
Grandma, why?

6112
03:33:22,060 --> 03:33:22,700
Grandma, why?

6113
03:33:26,660 --> 03:33:27,920
Is she okay?

6114
03:33:29,020 --> 03:33:29,620
Um...

6115
03:33:31,880 --> 03:33:33,420
How did she get up there?

6116
03:33:33,900 --> 03:33:38,200
Yeah, how did she... how did she get up there?

6117
03:33:38,440 --> 03:33:41,560
Oh, maybe the hole that we've been like...

6118
03:33:45,240 --> 03:33:47,440
Oh, I found it.

6119
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:48,900
Oh my god, it's over.

6120
03:33:49,260 --> 03:33:49,840
There's a tape.

6121
03:33:50,020 --> 03:33:50,940
Wait, don't forget the tape.

6122
03:33:51,560 --> 03:33:52,060
There's a tape?

6123
03:33:52,080 --> 03:33:52,580
It's on the ground.

6124
03:33:52,740 --> 03:33:53,180
It's on the ground.

6125
03:33:53,640 --> 03:33:54,640
Where you got the mirror?

6126
03:33:54,960 --> 03:33:55,580
Where you got the mirror?

6127
03:33:56,020 --> 03:33:56,920
Oh, there's a tape.

6128
03:33:57,660 --> 03:33:59,180
Oh my god, it's over.

6129
03:33:59,260 --> 03:33:59,960
Oh, there's the rope!

6130
03:34:00,820 --> 03:34:01,500
There's the rope!

6131
03:34:01,700 --> 03:34:01,940
Yeah!

6132
03:34:07,400 --> 03:34:08,960
See, I told you we could do it all today.

6133
03:34:08,960 --> 03:34:09,220
Hey!

6134
03:34:09,580 --> 03:34:11,620
The breaker still is out.

6135
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:13,520
I'm... I'm going out.

6136
03:34:13,540 --> 03:34:16,400
Dolores, you... you nasty... Ooh, you rascal.

6137
03:34:17,720 --> 03:34:20,220
You little rascal, Dolores.

6138
03:34:20,860 --> 03:34:24,100
But now you don't have to go through that stupid way to get to the basement.

6139
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:26,820
You can just do it normal.

6140
03:34:28,100 --> 03:34:30,800
Let's just go to the confessional.

6141
03:34:31,640 --> 03:34:32,920
Our safe place.

6142
03:34:33,440 --> 03:34:34,200
Our safe place.

6143
03:34:34,200 --> 03:34:36,220
Nothing bad happens to the confessional.

6144
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:39,520
Look, we did it!

6145
03:34:40,380 --> 03:34:41,180
Yay!

6146
03:34:44,720 --> 03:34:45,520
Yay!

6147
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:48,260
Yay!

6148
03:34:49,240 --> 03:34:49,440
Yay!

6149
03:34:52,760 --> 03:34:54,260
You did it!

6150
03:34:55,020 --> 03:34:56,560
It was definitely the worst level.

6151
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:58,300
So far.

6152
03:34:59,800 --> 03:35:00,840
That was...

6153
03:35:00,840 --> 03:35:03,520
That was definitely the worst level.

6154
03:35:04,880 --> 03:35:05,800
But we did it.

6155
03:35:06,620 --> 03:35:07,060
I...

6156
03:35:07,060 --> 03:35:10,700
We did not have the fucking ScreenRant.com.

6157
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:12,920
The guide us here that.

6158
03:35:13,580 --> 03:35:14,020
I...

6159
03:35:14,020 --> 03:35:16,140
I don't know how we would have made it.

6160
03:35:16,320 --> 03:35:16,620
I...

6161
03:35:16,620 --> 03:35:17,720
The fact that...

6162
03:35:17,720 --> 03:35:19,640
The ScreenRant one was so much more...

6163
03:35:19,640 --> 03:35:20,240
Like, so...

6164
03:35:20,240 --> 03:35:21,820
Actually, so much easier to follow that...

6165
03:35:21,820 --> 03:35:23,840
There was like a NeoSeeker.com one too.

6166
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:24,360
And that one...

6167
03:35:24,760 --> 03:35:25,120
NeoSeeker!

6168
03:35:25,260 --> 03:35:26,400
That one is terrible!

6169
03:35:26,720 --> 03:35:28,180
Don't follow that one, you guys.

6170
03:35:28,520 --> 03:35:29,180
It's so bad.

6171
03:35:29,180 --> 03:35:33,840
The surprising part is that even with the guide, it took us almost four hours.

6172
03:35:34,260 --> 03:35:36,160
To figure this out!

6173
03:35:36,840 --> 03:35:38,360
Wait, can I show you something funny?

6174
03:35:38,660 --> 03:35:38,900
Yeah.

6175
03:35:39,460 --> 03:35:40,020
Hold on.

6176
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:42,360
What is this?

6177
03:35:42,360 --> 03:35:42,760
What is this?

6178
03:35:42,760 --> 03:35:42,900
What screen...

6179
03:35:42,900 --> 03:35:44,360
I'm sending you a screenshot.

6180
03:35:46,340 --> 03:35:46,840
Okay.

6181
03:35:47,120 --> 03:35:48,280
I just licked it!

6182
03:35:51,440 --> 03:35:51,920
Okay.

6183
03:36:05,060 --> 03:36:06,360
That's pretty good.

6184
03:36:09,120 --> 03:36:10,000
Sorry, guys.

6185
03:36:10,160 --> 03:36:10,700
I can't show it.

6186
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:11,760
It shows you clicked on it too!

6187
03:36:12,260 --> 03:36:12,340
What?

6188
03:36:12,940 --> 03:36:13,420
Oh!

6189
03:36:13,660 --> 03:36:14,140
Just because...

6190
03:36:14,140 --> 03:36:15,000
Just now I did.

6191
03:36:15,140 --> 03:36:16,140
Cause I was like, what the heck?

6192
03:36:17,720 --> 03:36:19,920
I was looking for walkthroughs, you guys.

6193
03:36:20,420 --> 03:36:22,420
Also, it shows your video too.

6194
03:36:22,840 --> 03:36:23,040
Nice.

6195
03:36:23,040 --> 03:36:23,920
The grandma chapter.

6196
03:36:24,240 --> 03:36:24,540
Nice.

6197
03:36:24,540 --> 03:36:26,220
It shows Doki's stream as...

6198
03:36:26,220 --> 03:36:29,240
When I search Visage grandma chapter, it literally...

6199
03:36:30,040 --> 03:36:32,180
Doki's stream shows up in the Google search.

6200
03:36:32,360 --> 03:36:33,180
It's the algorithm.

6201
03:36:33,440 --> 03:36:34,780
I'm trying to game the algorithm.

6202
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:41,580
Now people will use my playthrough as the guide to beat the grandma chapter.

6203
03:36:42,380 --> 03:36:43,540
Oh my gosh.

6204
03:36:43,740 --> 03:36:44,460
That actually...

6205
03:36:44,460 --> 03:36:46,700
That took so much out of me, like mentally.

6206
03:36:47,320 --> 03:36:50,880
I'm so mentally drained from that chapter.

6207
03:36:51,040 --> 03:36:51,420
Wait, is the...

6208
03:36:51,420 --> 03:36:52,060
Is the...

6209
03:36:52,060 --> 03:36:52,400
Wait.

6210
03:36:52,740 --> 03:36:53,040
Hold on.

6211
03:36:53,140 --> 03:36:54,080
Is this a speed run?

6212
03:36:54,740 --> 03:36:55,180
What?

6213
03:36:55,300 --> 03:36:56,300
For the grandma chapter?

6214
03:36:56,760 --> 03:36:56,880
Yeah.

6215
03:36:56,880 --> 03:36:58,120
How fast do they do it?

6216
03:36:58,440 --> 03:36:59,760
How fast do you want to hear?

6217
03:37:01,800 --> 03:37:03,160
How fast do you think?

6218
03:37:03,780 --> 03:37:04,700
One hour.

6219
03:37:05,900 --> 03:37:06,900
30 minutes.

6220
03:37:07,320 --> 03:37:08,520
Is it 30 minutes?

6221
03:37:08,520 --> 03:37:09,820
Is it...

6222
03:37:11,280 --> 03:37:12,080
19 minutes.

6223
03:37:12,080 --> 03:37:12,560
19 minutes, baby?

6224
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:16,300
How do you do this in 19 minutes?

6225
03:37:19,450 --> 03:37:21,230
19 minutes and 19 seconds.

6226
03:37:21,690 --> 03:37:21,930
There's no way.

6227
03:37:22,370 --> 03:37:22,510
I...

6228
03:37:22,510 --> 03:37:23,550
They did not do this legit.

6229
03:37:23,650 --> 03:37:24,570
They must have like...

6230
03:37:24,570 --> 03:37:25,690
Fucking clips through shit.

6231
03:37:25,690 --> 03:37:26,090
Oh, okay.

6232
03:37:26,410 --> 03:37:26,810
Actually...

6233
03:37:26,810 --> 03:37:27,250
Okay, wait.

6234
03:37:27,370 --> 03:37:27,690
Wait.

6235
03:37:27,710 --> 03:37:28,530
How is this possible?

6236
03:37:28,650 --> 03:37:31,430
The video is 19 minutes, but their timer goes for 40.

6237
03:37:32,010 --> 03:37:33,890
Oh, it might be in parts.

6238
03:37:34,250 --> 03:37:35,410
They like split it in parts.

6239
03:37:35,650 --> 03:37:36,570
They probably cut it, yeah.

6240
03:37:36,570 --> 03:37:36,650
They probably cut it, yeah.

6241
03:37:36,690 --> 03:37:37,750
Just to like make it look more impressive.

6242
03:37:37,910 --> 03:37:38,550
I knew it.

6243
03:37:38,610 --> 03:37:38,850
There was...

6244
03:37:38,850 --> 03:37:39,630
There's no way.

6245
03:37:39,830 --> 03:37:40,630
There's no way.

6246
03:37:40,690 --> 03:37:42,170
There's no way in 19 minutes?

6247
03:37:42,170 --> 03:37:43,670
There's no way I can carry...

6248
03:37:43,670 --> 03:37:43,970
Even if you're a coward.

6249
03:37:44,310 --> 03:37:45,270
Like, even the fucking...

6250
03:37:45,270 --> 03:37:45,950
With the hammer.

6251
03:37:46,110 --> 03:37:46,790
There's no way.

6252
03:37:46,990 --> 03:37:48,470
There is no way.

6253
03:37:48,650 --> 03:37:48,810
Yeah.

6254
03:37:48,810 --> 03:37:53,310
Well, I think you just need to know where to break all the mirrors and then you break them at once and you don't have to keep...

6255
03:37:53,310 --> 03:37:58,670
Yeah, I guess like you get the muscle memory of like how to walk in the fucking dark all the time without the...

6256
03:37:58,970 --> 03:37:59,290
The...

6257
03:37:59,290 --> 03:38:00,490
And then just like...

6258
03:38:00,490 --> 03:38:03,850
Like, I guess they said like when you're in the mirror, the grandma can't chase you too.

6259
03:38:04,810 --> 03:38:05,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6260
03:38:05,170 --> 03:38:07,190
So she just like went in the mirror every time.

6261
03:38:07,890 --> 03:38:08,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6262
03:38:08,670 --> 03:38:09,290
Oh my...

6263
03:38:09,290 --> 03:38:10,790
I'm so tired from that.

6264
03:38:15,050 --> 03:38:15,530
Yippee!

6265
03:38:16,050 --> 03:38:18,730
Dude, we made it to Niagara Falls!

6266
03:38:19,550 --> 03:38:22,230
We made it!

6267
03:38:22,350 --> 03:38:23,050
We made it!

6268
03:38:23,130 --> 03:38:24,930
The road trip is finished!

6269
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:26,330
Oh, I'm tired.

6270
03:38:27,070 --> 03:38:29,210
And then we... Oh, you have your meeting soon, too.

6271
03:38:29,590 --> 03:38:31,410
I know, I gotta go, so...

6272
03:38:31,410 --> 03:38:31,830
Oh, yeah.

6273
03:38:31,990 --> 03:38:33,270
I knew we could finish in time!

6274
03:38:33,630 --> 03:38:38,770
Oh my... I think if we did not have the guide, this would have been a three-party.

6275
03:38:38,770 --> 03:38:41,110
Like, an extra three-part on its own.

6276
03:38:41,110 --> 03:38:42,270
Oh, yeah, three-parter, yeah.

6277
03:38:42,850 --> 03:38:44,950
Now we just have one more chapter.

6278
03:38:45,190 --> 03:38:47,410
One more chapter, and we're fucking free.

6279
03:38:49,790 --> 03:38:50,270
Woohoo!

6280
03:38:50,270 --> 03:38:54,250
That was the most unlinear chapter out of all three of them.

6281
03:38:55,550 --> 03:38:58,310
Yeah, that one was... That was, like, all the backtracking.

6282
03:38:58,310 --> 03:39:00,610
We should have saved last week's for this week.

6283
03:39:00,810 --> 03:39:01,430
It was so good.

6284
03:39:01,570 --> 03:39:07,730
Yeah, that one had so much backtracking, and everything, and, like, puzzles, and... Oh my god.

6285
03:39:07,730 --> 03:39:13,990
Well, I feel like if you could just store the... the hammer in your storage... I think if I could hold the fucking hammer...

6286
03:39:13,990 --> 03:39:14,230
Storage?

6287
03:39:14,390 --> 03:39:15,730
Yeah, it would have been fine!

6288
03:39:16,410 --> 03:39:22,630
If I could have the hammer in my... I don't understand why I can't put a fucking hammer in my pocket.

6289
03:39:23,110 --> 03:39:24,430
I don't understand.

6290
03:39:24,430 --> 03:39:24,830
I don't understand.

6291
03:39:24,830 --> 03:39:25,410
I don't get it.

6292
03:39:25,410 --> 03:39:29,190
I think my jean pockets is big enough for a giant hammer.

6293
03:39:29,930 --> 03:39:30,850
I agree.

6294
03:39:31,330 --> 03:39:33,850
Or you could put it, like, you know, put it in my pants, you know?

6295
03:39:35,150 --> 03:39:38,730
Is that a hammer, or are you just happy to see me?

6296
03:39:39,190 --> 03:39:42,190
Jean pockets on guy jeans are, like, so deep.

6297
03:39:42,190 --> 03:39:44,230
They can definitely fit everything that we had.

6298
03:39:44,330 --> 03:39:44,830
Yeah, exactly.

6299
03:39:44,830 --> 03:39:45,590
I agree.

6300
03:39:45,590 --> 03:39:45,670
I agree.

6301
03:39:46,510 --> 03:39:47,110
Yeah.

6302
03:39:47,990 --> 03:39:48,290
Yeah.

6303
03:39:49,530 --> 03:39:49,630
Yeah.

6304
03:39:49,630 --> 03:39:52,410
Well, another chapter done, Mint.

6305
03:39:52,630 --> 03:39:53,170
We did it.

6306
03:39:53,490 --> 03:39:56,650
I would stick around longer, but I do actually have to go, so...

6307
03:39:56,650 --> 03:39:57,890
Yeah, GG is Mint.

6308
03:39:58,050 --> 03:39:58,230
GG!

6309
03:39:58,230 --> 03:40:00,030
We have a good meeting.

6310
03:40:00,730 --> 03:40:01,330
Thanks!

6311
03:40:01,430 --> 03:40:02,450
Bye-bye!

6312
03:40:02,590 --> 03:40:02,990
Bye, everybody!

6313
03:40:03,610 --> 03:40:04,330
Bye-bye!

6314
03:40:04,850 --> 03:40:06,610
Say bye to Mint, guys!

6315
03:40:07,030 --> 03:40:07,910
Bye-bye!

6316
03:40:08,590 --> 03:40:09,070
Bye-bye!

6317
03:40:09,570 --> 03:40:09,950
Bye-bye!

6318
03:40:09,950 --> 03:40:10,250
Bye-bye!

6319
03:40:10,250 --> 03:40:10,430
Bye-bye!

6320
03:40:13,430 --> 03:40:14,230
Alright, everyone.

6321
03:40:15,150 --> 03:40:16,370
I'm really tired.

6322
03:40:18,710 --> 03:40:19,510
I am...

6323
03:40:20,810 --> 03:40:25,870
I'm, like, already approaching disassociation right now for this chapter.

6324
03:40:26,990 --> 03:40:27,810
Oh, my God.

6325
03:40:27,990 --> 03:40:31,570
You know the crazy part is that you guys were like, oh, the husband is now in that level.

6326
03:40:31,710 --> 03:40:32,590
Like, he's gonna chase you.

6327
03:40:32,750 --> 03:40:37,270
I think we have not seen the husband, like, after he stabbed me in London.

6328
03:40:37,270 --> 03:40:38,990
After he stabbed me there.

6329
03:40:39,430 --> 03:40:40,970
We haven't seen them, like, at all.

6330
03:40:41,090 --> 03:40:43,770
So, I don't know how the fuck we RNG that out of the way.

6331
03:40:44,210 --> 03:40:44,690
I...

6332
03:40:46,910 --> 03:40:48,110
But, anyway, guys.

6333
03:40:48,650 --> 03:40:49,130
Um...

6334
03:40:49,130 --> 03:40:51,490
Thank you, everybody, for coming.

6335
03:40:51,490 --> 03:40:56,270
I hope you guys enjoyed watching chapter three of, um...

6336
03:40:57,210 --> 03:40:57,910
Of Visage.

6337
03:40:58,010 --> 03:40:59,950
We have one last chapter left.

6338
03:41:00,090 --> 03:41:01,750
And then we'll be free.

6339
03:41:01,970 --> 03:41:02,350
Oh, my gosh.

6340
03:41:02,410 --> 03:41:02,910
She disappeared.

6341
03:41:03,750 --> 03:41:04,530
Hey, guys.

6342
03:41:04,710 --> 03:41:05,850
I can't save her dog.

6343
03:41:05,850 --> 03:41:06,770
I'm gonna...

6344
03:41:07,330 --> 03:41:07,810
Looking...

6345
03:41:07,810 --> 03:41:08,470
Sleep now.

6346
03:41:08,950 --> 03:41:09,590
I know.

6347
03:41:09,810 --> 03:41:10,990
Like, it's 8 p.m.

6348
03:41:11,050 --> 03:41:11,670
I'm gonna go to sleep.

6349
03:41:11,830 --> 03:41:14,570
Because I'm so tired from that.

6350
03:41:14,910 --> 03:41:18,130
It took a lot of mental power to power through this chapter.

6351
03:41:18,570 --> 03:41:19,010
Uh...

6352
03:41:19,010 --> 03:41:20,910
With all the, uh...

6353
03:41:20,910 --> 03:41:22,690
With all the backtracking.

6354
03:41:22,690 --> 03:41:23,530
And the puzzles.

6355
03:41:24,070 --> 03:41:26,210
And trying to figure out where to go.

6356
03:41:26,390 --> 03:41:27,810
And the hammer time.

6357
03:41:28,430 --> 03:41:30,250
I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

6358
03:41:30,390 --> 03:41:31,350
As always, everybody.

6359
03:41:31,610 --> 03:41:32,550
Stay hydrated.

6360
03:41:32,810 --> 03:41:33,270
Posture check.

6361
03:41:33,390 --> 03:41:35,130
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6362
03:41:35,130 --> 03:41:36,210
And if you, except for me.

6363
03:41:36,350 --> 03:41:36,950
Head to bed.

6364
03:41:37,110 --> 03:41:38,230
Because you deserve it.

6365
03:41:38,370 --> 03:41:39,470
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6366
03:41:40,030 --> 03:41:40,710
Bye, guys.

6367
03:41:41,230 --> 03:41:41,630
Bye.

6368
03:41:41,630 --> 03:41:41,850
Bye.
