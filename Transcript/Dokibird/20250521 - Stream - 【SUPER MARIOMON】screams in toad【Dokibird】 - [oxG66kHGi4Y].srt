1
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,840
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,540
It's me, Tokyo!

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,460
And I might sound really weird because I finally plugged in my new mic this morning.

4
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,980
I know I should have done it after my stream yesterday when my sound guy was still alive.

5
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,800
He still is.

6
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,120
Sorry.

7
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,060
Yeah, I sound very different.

8
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,540
I know.

9
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,960
I sound really weird.

10
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,820
Like, I... I know.

11
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,520
Yeah.

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,900
So, um... I don't know how to do anything.

13
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,560
I don't know what to do.

14
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,740
I was adjusting my mic and I... I don't... Yeah, I sound... I know!

15
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,520
I sound like I'm in somewhere else.

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,060
I don't know.

17
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,200
So, like... Okay.

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:34,620
Alright.

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
I'm gonna... Alright.

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,800
We're gonna figure this out together until sound people are alive.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,840
Like, I don't think anybody... I, like, even sent it to my manager and was like...

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,140
Like, I sound so weird.

23
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,160
And then my manager, like... I can see that they're online.

24
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,000
But, like, they never replied back.

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't know.

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,580
My entire staff team, like, disappeared.

27
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,840
For some fucking reason.

28
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,180
I, like, I... I messaged, like, three people.

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,500
And, like, I got left on read.

30
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,420
I, like... So, like, I see them.

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:13,960
I... Okay.

32
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,620
Sound guy is offline.

33
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,080
I see that they're offline.

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,100
Our main sound person is offline.

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,160
But, I see my manager online.

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,960
I, like, but I was left on read.

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,220
I... I was...

38
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,560
I never... They never said anything back on read.

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,390
I...

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay.

41
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,400
So, we'll figure this out to... I'm gonna show my...

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,240
GoXLR settings.

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,680
And then, we'll figure this out.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,540
I don't know.

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,800
I'm so confused.

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,340
Okay.

47
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,080
So, alright, this is either a gate thing or a compressor thing.

48
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,960
So, I'm gonna show you guys several things to, like, help me figure this out.

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,060
I'll show you guys several things.

50
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,760
Okay, let me do a text.

51
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,340
Figuring out sound.

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,220
My new mic together.

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,560
Text together.

54
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,240
Let's see, yeah.

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
Text support.

56
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Text support with dragoons.

57
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,060
Alright, for those who are like, where's my game?

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,000
And it's all in Comic Sans, too.

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,740
Alright.

60
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay, here we go.

61
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,660
Okay, and then, I don't know.

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,480
Maybe someone will get it right.

63
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,720
I have everything saved.

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,180
I have all my settings saved.

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,620
So, like, if we somehow fuck it up, don't worry.

66
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,040
Because we can always revert it.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,420
Alright, so...

68
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,840
And then we'll figure all of this out together.

69
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,820
Alright.

70
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,700
Only substitutes are online.

71
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,240
Okay.

72
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,780
Alright.

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,660
Get that...

74
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,540
Get the substitutes.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,200
Oh my god.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,740
We have one of my staff members alive.

77
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,380
Thank god.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,020
Okay.

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,480
Alright.

80
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,640
Get the substitutes in.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,020
We're gonna figure this out.

82
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,740
Alright.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,560
So...

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,660
So we have this.

85
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,820
We have this.

86
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,720
Which is...

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,980
It's a condenser mic.

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,760
So the microphone is a condenser microphone.

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,140
We have this.

90
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,680
We have...

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,100
We have this.

92
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:24,980
Oh.

93
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,600
We have this.

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,120
Okay.

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,300
Wait.

96
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,320
Let me figure out...

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,540
We have this.

98
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,620
Alright.

99
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,240
We have this.

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,660
And then we also have...

101
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,980
There's my other...

102
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,780
We're swinging...

103
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,980
One other image.

104
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,620
Okay.

105
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,680
And then we also have...

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,340
We also have this.

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
I don't know where to put this.

108
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:45,660
Okay.

109
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,920
We have this as well.

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:48,920
Alright.

111
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,300
One of you guys will figure this out for me.

112
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
What...

113
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,140
Okay.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,880
Um...

115
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Alright.

116
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,660
So...

117
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,800
We have...

118
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,060
Okay.

119
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,980
Anyone have any idea...

120
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,000
What to do?

121
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,380
Anyone!

122
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,420
Put all your points into attack.

123
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,300
Okay.

124
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,100
Okay.

125
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,240
We will figure this out.

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,120
The mic meter should be maxed out...

127
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,140
And peaking at all times.

128
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,100
I think.

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:24,940
Alright.

130
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
Dude, I...

131
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,500
For the sake of everybody here that's watching...

132
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,700
I feel like...

133
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,600
That should not be what we do.

134
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,620
Thank you for the super chat.

135
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Thank you.

136
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,840
Thank you.

137
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,860
Um...

138
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,520
Um...

139
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,860
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

140
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,240
Thank you.

141
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,740
Thank you.

142
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,300
Have you tried turning it to 11?

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,080
Thank you for the super chat.

144
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,460
Thank you.

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,200
Thank you.

146
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:47,900
Alright.

147
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,720
Alright.

148
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,360
Okay.

149
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,640
That's out of the way.

150
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:50,920
Alright.

151
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,460
It's okay, we get all the bad ideas out of the way, so we can get... So all the ideas left would be the good ideas, right?

152
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,200
So, it's okay.

153
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,000
We're just getting rid of all the bad ideas.

154
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,520
Hey, Doki, today's my birthday, or as a friend told me, womb eviction day.

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320
Can I get a jingle from my Kamiyoshi?

156
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,940
Of course you can, Kongu.

157
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,940
Thank you for the super chat.

158
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,900
Thank you, thank you.

159
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,780
Happy birthday to you.

160
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,760
Happy birthday to you.

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
Happy birthday, dear Kongu.

162
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,820
Happy birthday to you.

163
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah!

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Happy birthday!

165
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,720
Alright.

166
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,060
Okay.

167
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Do we have any idea?

168
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Do we... Cody, thank you for the super chat.

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,180
Thank you, thank you.

170
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,440
I was just at an anime convention.

171
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,740
There's so much Doki merch.

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh my god!

173
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,980
Did you spend any money?

174
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,940
Did you buy them?

175
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,320
Please tell me you did buy them, Cody.

176
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,680
Thank you for the super chat.

177
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,920
Thank you, thank you.

178
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,220
You can't just not buy Doki merch, you know?

179
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Alright.

180
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,760
Turn ratio down and gain up.

181
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,240
What's... Which one's the ratio?

182
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,360
Oh, okay.

183
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:58,940
Wait.

184
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,260
What do we turn to?

185
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay, do you know what ratio is?

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Before I do any of that, do you know what it is?

187
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Because I don't.

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,300
I...

189
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,700
What even is... Okay.

190
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,640
Gain up?

191
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:13,960
Okay.

192
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm gonna turn the game up, guys.

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,060
Okay.

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,520
The gain is up.

195
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,580
Do I sound better?

196
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,140
Or do I sound worse?

197
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,840
Lower the ratio.

198
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,180
Threshold to...

199
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,660
Minus L plus 3.

200
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:27,900
Okay.

201
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,020
Let me turn it down a little bit more.

202
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,580
Okay.

203
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,860
Sound... Okay.

204
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,560
Compressor.

205
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,900
Lower the ratio to 3 to 1.

206
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,760
And then...

207
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,540
Um...

208
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,280
There's no 3-1.

209
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,260
There's no...

210
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,820
There's no...

211
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,400
There's no 3-1.

212
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,680
There's...

213
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,440
4-1.

214
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,200
3.2-1.

215
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,440
2.5-1.

216
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,240
2-1.

217
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,240
There's 2-1.

218
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,660
Why is there no 3-1?

219
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,620
Why...

220
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,800
Why is there...

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,940
It's because I turn away from the mic.

222
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,960
Maybe if I...

223
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,340
Maybe if I can...

224
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,240
I could just...

225
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,840
Position it in a way where...

226
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,680
Because when I talk, I turn away a little bit from the mic.

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,020
Maybe that's why...

228
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,200
Ooh.

229
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Maybe if I do this...

230
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,680
And then...

231
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,920
Rotate it?

232
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,760
Like that?

233
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,160
Does that...

234
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,800
Is that better?

235
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,340
Um...

236
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,940
3-2-1 should be fine.

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,220
Is that...

238
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,880
Is that better?

239
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,900
Or is that worse?

240
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,040
I, like, turned a little bit away...

241
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,040
But, like, also, like, pointed at the mic.

242
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,160
It was better before...

243
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,660
This is worse.

244
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

245
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
This is worse.

246
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,520
Okay.

247
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,800
Alright.

248
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,040
Let me...

249
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,060
Fix that then.

250
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Okay.

251
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,660
I'll do this.

252
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,140
And then...

253
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,420
Rotate this.

254
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,480
Like that.

255
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,500
And then...

256
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,900
Um...

257
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,760
How about now?

258
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,960
Worse or better?

259
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,720
Worse or better?

260
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,740
Also, I'll do...

261
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,220
What was it?

262
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
3-2-1.

263
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,440
Okay.

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,520
3-2-1.

265
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,820
And then...

266
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,260
Raise the threshold to...

267
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,320
Minus 45.

268
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
You mean...

269
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,460
Lower the threshold?

270
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,820
Do you mean...

271
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,140
Uh...

272
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,860
Lower...

273
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,020
Lower the threshold?

274
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:09,880
Or...

275
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,620
Because, okay...

276
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,200
If I sound further away...

277
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,120
When I do this...

278
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,780
It's because, like...

279
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,480
Because I'm looking at my chat.

280
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,660
So my mouth is away from the mic.

281
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,440
Because I'm looking away from my chat.

282
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,940
I'm looking at my chat.

283
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,620
Um...

284
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,680
And...

285
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,580
Um...

286
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,300
So raise it to a higher negative?

287
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,220
Oh!

288
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,060
Okay.

289
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,640
I have to look at chat?

290
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,300
What do you mean?

291
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,120
Don't do that.

292
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,460
Okay.

293
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,820
Mine...

294
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,220
It doesn't go to 40.

295
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,060
My threshold...

296
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,400
Does not go to 40...

297
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,560
45, by the way.

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,260
Does...

299
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,680
Oh, wait.

300
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,160
Which 40?

301
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,460
Oh, wait.

302
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,820
Wait, wait, wait.

303
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,800
Oh, you mean my gate?

304
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,660
Oh!

305
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,900
On the gate!

306
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,420
Okay.

307
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,080
Okay.

308
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,600
I put the gate...

309
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,560
Uh...

310
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,500
Sorry.

311
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,840
Uh...

312
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,180
I...

313
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I put the...

314
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,420
I...

315
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,800
I did on the compressor.

316
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
I did it to, like, 40.

317
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:03,860
Um...

318
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm not gonna move the mic when I move my head.

319
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,340
That's way too much work.

320
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,220
I bought a better mic...

321
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,220
So that it improves my sound quality.

322
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,080
And also makes my life easier.

323
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,120
I...

324
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
If I'm gonna...

325
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,420
If, like, it's gonna be a fucking problem...

326
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,620
I will go back to my old mic...

327
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,200
And just buy the same old mic, guys.

328
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,160
I thought...

329
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,320
By paying more money...

330
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,380
I do less work.

331
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,480
That's the whole point.

332
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,080
What's the point of paying more money...

333
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,180
If you do more work?

334
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
Right, right, right.

335
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,500
That's the...

336
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,820
Okay.

337
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,320
Jokes on you.

338
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,260
Jokes on you.

339
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,940
I bought...

340
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,540
It's the Newman.

341
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,020
It's the Newman 102.

342
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,620
That's the one I bought.

343
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,780
Um...

344
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,300
Okay.

345
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,020
Is it...

346
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,880
Uh...

347
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,940
Is it better?

348
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,360
Or should we adjust it more?

349
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,140
Is this better or not?

350
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,940
I don't know.

351
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,520
I mean, I could've bought the...

352
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,460
I was debating about the...

353
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,960
The Newman 3...

354
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
Instead of the 2...

355
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,520
Like, 103 instead of the 102.

356
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,580
No, these...

357
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:24,940
Um...

358
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,420
Sound people said that I should get 102 over 103...

359
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,920
Because my room needed more treatment...

360
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,940
If I was gonna get 103.

361
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,480
So, like...

362
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,940
So, I bought the 102...

363
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,460
Because I had...

364
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,980
I can have a less treated room.

365
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,420
I still sound...

366
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:40,880
Worse?

367
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,280
I sound...

368
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,780
I guess?

369
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,740
Okay, guys.

370
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,320
I...

371
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,540
I...

372
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,740
I'm trying to improve my quality of life here.

373
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,660
Hi, Doki.

374
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,300
I'm a certified audio...

375
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,840
Audio engineer.

376
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,040
I recommend turning the mic volume...

377
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,660
All the way down.

378
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,660
Let's see.

379
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,860
Thank you for the super chat.

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,240
Thank you.

381
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,940
Thank you.

382
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,380
Come here.

383
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,340
All right.

384
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,660
What else do I do?

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,260
Sorry.

386
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,220
I'm like further...

387
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,180
Now I'm closer to the mic.

388
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:10,580
Okay.

389
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,620
Is there anything else I can do?

390
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,540
This new thing was expensive.

391
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,780
So, I'm gonna make it work.

392
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,280
Real, Doki.

393
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,040
Real.

394
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,120
Robert.

395
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,360
Thank you for the super chat.

396
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,840
Thank you.

397
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,460
Thank you.

398
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,930
I was told...

399
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,160
That...

400
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,950
This was gonna be an improvement...

401
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,320
From my old mic.

402
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,000
So, we are going to improve this.

403
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,500
Okay?

404
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,930
I have to sound...

405
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,440
Better...

406
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
Than what I did before.

407
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,890
I do not want to sound weird.

408
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,580
All right.

409
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,100
Sound...

410
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
Substitute sound people.

411
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,700
I did all the other stuff.

412
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,660
What else should I do?

413
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,420
We will make it better.

414
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
All right.

415
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,820
How...

416
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,180
What else?

417
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
Now we are the sound...

418
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,720
Sound team!

419
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,980
My dragoons!

420
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,560
My substitute sound team!

421
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,820
What else do I do?

422
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay.

423
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm gonna...

424
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,380
I am going to...

425
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,520
Okay.

426
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,080
I'll screenshot.

427
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,520
Okay.

428
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,340
I did everything.

429
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,340
I did minus 45 threshold for the gate.

430
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,100
I turned up my gain.

431
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,560
Should I turn up my gain no more?

432
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,160
Guys?

433
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,420
Can you move the mic away an inch or two?

434
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,720
Okay.

435
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,160
It's away from me.

436
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,060
It's away.

437
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,260
Is that better?

438
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,540
I moved it away from me.

439
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,280
Whoa!

440
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,220
What do you mean, whoa?

441
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,120
Too far?

442
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,780
Whoa!

443
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,220
Hello!

444
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,160
Hello!

445
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,660
Turn up the gain a little bit more?

446
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,120
Okay.

447
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,100
All right.

448
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,820
Two...

449
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:01,920
Three...

450
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,580
Okay.

451
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,900
I turned up the gain a little more.

452
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,060
I'm all the way over here!

453
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,140
No, don't leave.

454
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,180
Don't go!

455
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm going away now!

456
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,940
Oh!

457
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,580
No!

458
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,980
No, don't leave.

459
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,480
You just need me back!

460
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,060
Okay.

461
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,500
Is this better or worse?

462
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,260
Better or worse?

463
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,900
She's so fine.

464
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,020
I'm fine.

465
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,420
My people need me!

466
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,560
Hi, dragon!

467
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,320
She's better.

468
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
All right.

469
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,660
I am further away from the mic a little.

470
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,820
Because sound guy...

471
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,940
Substitute sound team...

472
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,540
Comebacks.

473
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,880
Sad face.

474
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,220
All right.

475
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,380
So, I am a little further away from the mic now.

476
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
And my...

477
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,860
You can see that my mouth is turning away from the mic a little.

478
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,440
Because I'm looking at chat.

479
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,740
And there...

480
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm...

481
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,040
Now I'm not...

482
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm now...

483
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,160
My sound is going towards the mic.

484
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,620
This is me going...

485
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,800
Me looking at my chat while I'm talking.

486
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,300
Um...

487
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,020
Okay.

488
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,300
Is it better now?

489
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,880
How do I sound like?

490
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,600
Is this good enough for...

491
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I can't be good enough!

492
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,740
I refuse...

493
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,780
For it to be good enough!

494
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,440
Okay.

495
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,380
How about now?

496
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,260
We are not doing good enough.

497
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,700
We are doing good.

498
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,840
I demand good.

499
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,500
Not good enough.

500
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,260
I don't care.

501
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,940
No, no, no.

502
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,860
You think you don't care about audio?

503
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,420
Until you watch a stream with very shitty audio.

504
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,120
Then you care.

505
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm not getting a mic.

506
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,100
Because if I get a mic...

507
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,200
Okay.

508
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,960
I'm not getting two fucking mics.

509
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,600
So that one mic is the one where it looks at chat.

510
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,920
The other one is the one where I'm looking at my fucking monitor.

511
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,400
Okay.

512
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,880
Why doki sounds so strange?

513
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,260
We're doing tech support with dragoons right now.

514
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,920
I swear to god.

515
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
I will bring the...

516
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,660
I swear to god, guys.

517
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,200
If...

518
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,980
If we do not figure this out, I'm bringing my old mic back.

519
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
I swear to god.

520
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I will turn this car around and re-plug in my old mic.

521
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,880
I...

522
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,580
Please don't.

523
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,040
I will turn this car around.

524
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,800
I...

525
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,820
This is what happens when you're gone.

526
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,220
This is exactly what happens.

527
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,800
Main sound get chimed in and asked to do this.

528
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,600
Well, he wasn't online when I...

529
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,760
When I wanted to do on stream.

530
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,380
I could have done it yesterday.

531
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,260
But I went to bed.

532
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,260
To be fair, I could have done this yesterday.

533
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,020
I...

534
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,380
So now, we're doing this live with everybody.

535
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,720
Everyone can see the process.

536
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,840
Ben is important.

537
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,220
Okay.

538
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,960
All right, guys.

539
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,780
It's okay.

540
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,760
This is like...

541
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,220
This is a group effort.

542
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,580
When we fix this.

543
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,500
Uh...

544
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,700
When you say really hard...

545
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,200
These and P...

546
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,940
P...

547
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,500
P...

548
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,580
And P's.

549
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,660
We can hear it.

550
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,260
Like...

551
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,600
P...

552
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,340
P...

553
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:03,560
N...

554
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,220
G...

555
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,860
And...

556
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,900
Purpose.

557
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,980
And...

558
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,040
Being a...

559
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,420
Pussy.

560
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,640
Yeah, we'll do it.

561
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,800
As a...

562
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,320
Team.

563
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,680
Uh...

564
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,020
Together.

565
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,840
Oh, I hear it.

566
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,660
Yeah, it pops.

567
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,600
Um...

568
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,300
Please put up...

569
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,960
No, I do.

570
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
I have, like...

571
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,080
Shit sticking everywhere around my room.

572
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,620
But, like...

573
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,300
Obviously, I need more stuff.

574
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,780
I need more...

575
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,920
Um...

576
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,800
Last time I remembered what helped a lot was when I dumped, um...

577
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,280
Plushies around my room.

578
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,480
And it did muffle some things.

579
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,800
Uh...

580
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,380
So, I have to, like...

581
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,180
I guess I just gotta stick more foam around.

582
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:57,960
The...

583
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,900
The issue about the foam is that it keeps falling off the walls.

584
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,080
So, like...

585
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,740
I'm scared.

586
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm scared of, like...

587
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,440
Using anything more permanent.

588
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,680
Because, um...

589
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,340
Because, like...

590
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,180
Uh...

591
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,700
What am I...

592
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,260
What am I gonna say?

593
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,980
Because, like...

594
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,000
I rent this area.

595
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,760
And I'm scared it's gonna rip off.

596
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,900
No, I use the...

597
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,560
The tape.

598
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,180
Like, I use, like, the...

599
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,000
The foam adhesive thing.

600
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,760
But it keeps coming off.

601
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,260
So, like...

602
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,780
I have a couple of, like...

603
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,540
Foam stuff just on the floor.

604
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,520
Because, like...

605
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,440
It all fell off.

606
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,100
And I just...

607
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,880
I was just...

608
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,640
I'm too lazy to stick them.

609
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,340
I...

610
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,640
I...

611
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,040
I...

612
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,300
I sort of low-key just gave up.

613
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,900
All right.

614
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,400
All right.

615
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,140
Maybe we stick with the old mic today.

616
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,860
Or stick with us.

617
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,820
And work off here.

618
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
So that we can do your settings plus EQ.

619
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,440
All right, guys.

620
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,960
Do we use this mic?

621
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,060
Or do we go back to our old mic?

622
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,160
Do this...

623
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,020
Okay, we'll do a vote.

624
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,360
We'll do a vote.

625
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,800
Okay.

626
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,300
Which mic?

627
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,760
New mic?

628
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,060
We fucked up sound.

629
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,900
New mic with weird settings.

630
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,700
Old mic for the same old jokey.

631
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,740
Okay.

632
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,760
We'll do a poll.

633
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,200
And then from that poll, we're the side.

634
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,060
But this mic sounds good.

635
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,300
Use both at the same time.

636
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,000
I swear you all vote.

637
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,060
I can't handle the awful background noise anymore.

638
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,160
I desire the scuff.

639
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,900
New mic with weird settings.

640
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,240
We're not doing...

641
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,540
I don't have two microphone arms.

642
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,860
Also, do I need a paw filter?

643
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,120
I think that's what...

644
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't know what it is.

645
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,540
I don't know what paw filters are.

646
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,900
And what they actually do.

647
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,300
But like, this one has no paw filters.

648
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,680
The paw filter I had when my other mic was like, stuck.

649
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,020
Was like, stuck.

650
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,600
But I don't know what to buy.

651
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,580
There's so many...

652
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,340
Okay, sound guy.

653
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,400
Link me to a paw filter and I'll buy it.

654
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,720
I don't know what to get.

655
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,240
Yeah, I have no paw filter.

656
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,220
It's like naked.

657
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,600
I have a naked microphone.

658
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,580
Sounds crunchy.

659
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,090
Doesn't really do anything.

660
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,410
Just angle your mic.

661
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,390
Paw filter filters that pop.

662
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,970
Like, pussy.

663
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,810
You know, like, pussy cat.

664
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,870
Meow, meow.

665
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,850
Paprika.

666
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,670
What if I...

667
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,110
What if...

668
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,370
Jesus Christ.

669
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,210
Yeah, just raw.

670
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,190
I shouldn't say that.

671
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,290
This microphone is naked and raw.

672
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,310
Pepperoni.

673
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,370
That's my...

674
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,790
That's my...

675
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,790
Oh, she...

676
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,590
Would you like some...

677
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,790
Pepperoni...

678
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:20,910
Pizza...

679
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,150
With that...

680
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,910
I'm a...

681
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,170
Dokio...

682
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,770
I'm...

683
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,870
That's what...

684
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,730
That's what the paw sit is for.

685
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,050
Whoa, Dokio...

686
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,090
That's right.

687
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,870
I'm here for unprotected pops.

688
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,810
Yeah.

689
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,670
Me and my...

690
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,830
Naked microphone...

691
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,010
Going in unprotected...

692
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,510
With the...

693
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,510
Pepperoni...

694
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,190
Pizza...

695
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,610
Mamma mia...

696
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,210
Mamma mia...

697
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,150
Yeah...

698
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:12,030
I did not expect this microphone to just be streamed.

699
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,030
All right.

700
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,310
Um, okay.

701
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,510
Okay, so sound guy, just send me, send me the link.

702
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,390
We're gonna get some protection for my microphone.

703
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,350
So sound guy, just link me what pop filter I should get.

704
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:27,990
I don't know.

705
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,490
There's so many different kinds of pop filters, so I don't know which one to get.

706
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,510
So, all right.

707
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,210
New mic with weird settings.

708
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:35,850
All right.

709
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,090
We'll go with that.

710
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,330
We'll figure this out later.

711
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,310
We'll figure this out.

712
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,050
Ah, the pepperoni, pepperoni.

713
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,910
You know the pepperoni, the no one.

714
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,270
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

715
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,310
Thank you, thank you.

716
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,750
Valvary, thank you for the super chat.

717
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,590
Thank you, thank you.

718
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,910
You can try being as Italian as you want, but you all know we crave, we all crave the maid.

719
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,490
Yes, I'll keep that joke up.

720
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,510
Thank you for the super chat.

721
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,490
Thank you, thank you.

722
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,750
Blazing Gun, thank you for the super chat.

723
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,730
Thank you, thank you.

724
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,430
But, as promised, a super chat, hopefully you get the settings right on the new expensive-ass mic.

725
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,390
Thank you, the super chat.

726
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,250
Thank you, thank you.

727
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,650
It sounds like she's spitting in her ears.

728
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,450
Yeah!

729
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,590
Thank you, the super chat.

730
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,950
Thank you, thank you.

731
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:20,810
Oops.

732
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,110
Am I purposely...

733
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,650
...making you un-pumped-a-ple.

734
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,880
Okay, let's play... let's actually, uh, play the...

735
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,840
Let's play the game.

736
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,700
Um, let's play the game.

737
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,320
Alright, I'll stop.

738
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,740
Um...

739
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,440
New microphone...

740
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,040
You go psst, psst, psst, psst, psst.

741
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,560
Alright, new microphone era, guys.

742
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,480
Okay, I'll stop.

743
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,340
Stop fucking with you guys.

744
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,860
It's Tokyo time.

745
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,960
Um...

746
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,580
Is she p-pothering you, queen?

747
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,420
Alright.

748
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
You might- Okay, now we play.

749
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,860
Oh, the prince!

750
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,780
Ha ha ha!

751
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,260
The prince!

752
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,500
Okay, wait.

753
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,340
Tell me if the toad voice is a little fucked up.

754
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,200
The prince has accepted our petition to become commanders!

755
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,620
Hope you're ready for a wild battle style!

756
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,400
Ha ha ha ha!

757
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,240
It's even better with the toad voice!

758
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,100
The toad voice sounds better somehow!

759
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,100
Ha ha ha ha!

760
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,680
Ha ha ha!

761
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,420
Nice.

762
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,160
Alright.

763
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:40,760
Ha ha ha!

764
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,500
Geo, thank you for the super chat!

765
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:42,920
Thank you!

766
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,500
Thank you!

767
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,620
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickle peppers!

768
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,700
A peck of pickle peppers, Peter Piper picked!

769
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,660
Ha ha ha ha!

770
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,340
Ha ha ha!

771
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay.

772
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,120
Now, that was the last one.

773
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,900
For real, now.

774
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,380
Guys.

775
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,300
That was the last one.

776
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,160
I won't fuck with you guys anymore.

777
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,280
Ha ha ha!

778
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:00,920
Ha ha!

779
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,280
For today.

780
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,140
We're..

781
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,960
Bryce, thank you for the super chat!

782
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,320
Thank you!

783
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,800
The piece delightfully?

784
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,620
Right on my brain inside my skull.

785
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,800
Please, keep going.

786
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,540
Thank you for this super chat!

787
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,000
Thank you!

788
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,660
Thank you!

789
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,500
Papa!

790
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,840
Uh… Thank you for the super chat!

791
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,200
Thank you!

792
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,740
Just checking what it sounds like that for you to say my name with a new mic and your peas.

793
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,860
Thank you for the super chat!

794
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,220
Thank you!

795
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,780
Uh…

796
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,360
Maybe this was a mistake to put this in the background to sleep, too.

797
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,860
Okay, like, you know exactly what kind of game this is when there are, like, 500 million toads in this game.

798
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,260
Like, there's no way you're trying to go to sleep with toad voice.

799
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,480
There's no way.

800
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,440
Alright, let's see.

801
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,800
Oh, what the heck?

802
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,080
Oh my god, he's here to slam you with his dumpy.

803
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,120
Hey, you go there, yellow Yoshi.

804
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,020
You go.

805
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,240
Do what you want to do.

806
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,360
Alright.

807
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,640
Get this yellow Yoshi out of here.

808
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,020
Okay, Swagoon is dead.

809
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,300
Goodbye.

810
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,140
Oh, Smugoon.

811
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:11,920
Goodbye.

812
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,420
I should've... I was not paying attention to your HP.

813
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,500
I am...

814
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,360
You guys noticed that I wasn't paying attention?

815
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,980
Alright, let's... Let's get...

816
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,180
Okay.

817
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,840
Uh... You know what?

818
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,440
What if I just throw myself?

819
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
How fucked up would that be?

820
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,680
Let's see.

821
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,480
Let's get Magnet Bomb in here.

822
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,820
Alright, nice.

823
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,100
Yay!

824
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,080
I realize, like, sound issues is, like, the most prevalent cause of my streams.

825
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't know why.

826
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,360
I don't know how I keep fucking up sound.

827
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,860
I don't know.

828
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,160
I've been a...

829
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,100
I've been a streamer for so long.

830
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,060
But yet, somehow, I always keep fucking up my sound.

831
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,540
No matter what.

832
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,300
Yay!

833
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,320
No wonder you need a sound team.

834
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,860
Alright.

835
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,120
Let me...

836
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,400
Let me throw him, too.

837
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,120
I will throw everybody.

838
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,540
Dad will throw everyone.

839
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,350
Alright.

840
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,010
Oh, yeah.

841
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,710
By the way, speaking of sound...

842
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,510
I realized yesterday, when I uploaded...

843
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,970
Jesus Christ, how many fucking things do you have?

844
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:45,430
Okay.

845
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:53,090
When I was, like, uploading my Luna Snow video of the, you know...

846
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,450
Dance!

847
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,570
Dance, you fuck!

848
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,250
Dance!

849
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:56,810
Yes!

850
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,390
Yeah!

851
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,750
That video...

852
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:07,010
I realized my music video, no matter what, was in the gaming category for the last couple...

853
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,350
For...

854
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,310
Since it was uploaded.

855
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,650
So then I was, like...

856
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,630
Oh...

857
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,050
I wonder if, like...

858
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,710
I lost momentum because I put it in the wrong category!

859
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,370
It wasn't in the music category!

860
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,850
It was in the fucking...

861
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,570
Oh, wait!

862
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,690
You're evolving!

863
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,570
It was in the gaming category...

864
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,570
The entire time.

865
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,070
So I think...

866
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,330
I think, like, I fucked up the algorithm.

867
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,490
Or, like...

868
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,290
Just the...

869
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,650
The views on that.

870
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,450
It's been a pain trying to listen to it on YouTube.

871
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,490
Oh!

872
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,970
That evolves on the...

873
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,550
KIDU?

874
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,510
Oh, my God!

875
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,030
Lakitu!

876
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,790
Sorry, Lakitu!

877
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,230
That evolves...

878
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,870
That evolves on the Lakitu?

879
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,250
Oh, my God!

880
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,130
Wait!

881
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,290
Now you're actually a good Pokemon!

882
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:56,790
Come on!

883
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,850
Alright, rock through.

884
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,870
I didn't know that.

885
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,470
That's cool.

886
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,710
Okay.

887
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,690
Lakitu!

888
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,470
Nice!

889
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,270
Okay.

890
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,310
Oh, you can learn more?

891
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,630
It's Barrage.

892
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,630
Oh, no.

893
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,430
That shit's weak.

894
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,230
I only like high numbers.

895
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,370
Yeah, so...

896
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,230
I guess now you can listen to it.

897
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,330
I guess now you can listen to it...

898
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,870
To it...

899
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,710
Um...

900
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,590
On...

901
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,490
Uh...

902
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,010
On YouTube music now.

903
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,690
I think now you can listen to it on YouTube music.

904
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,230
Because I fixed it.

905
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,690
Whoops.

906
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,230
Wait.

907
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,690
Where's my...

908
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:43,410
Okay.

909
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,290
I'm trying to figure out...

910
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,290
Where's the fishing one?

911
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,410
Okay.

912
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,050
That's the fishing.

913
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,410
Okay.

914
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,990
I wanted to catch the big fish.

915
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,650
I'm gonna try one more time.

916
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,230
I'm gonna try one more time to catch the...

917
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,510
The big fish now.

918
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,950
Also, I'm trying to figure out how to release music on like Spotify.

919
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,170
I don't know.

920
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,050
I'm too stupid.

921
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,930
I should really ask someone.

922
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,230
I really...

923
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,210
I should really...

924
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,670
You know, I should ask people about that.

925
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,390
I realize I should be doing a lot of things.

926
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,410
Starting today.

927
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,970
I shall be more...

928
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,970
Starting today.

929
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,790
Starting tomorrow.

930
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,570
Or maybe not tomorrow.

931
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,870
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

932
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,850
Starting the day...

933
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,550
Next week.

934
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,070
I shall be more productive.

935
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:28,990
I...

936
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:31,590
Wait.

937
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,970
I have a sound team.

938
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,370
Why did I not ask my sound team?

939
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:35,910
Okay.

940
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,830
But to be fair...

941
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,550
Why didn't they tell me instead of making me ask them?

942
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,430
I...

943
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,210
Do you not have a sound?

944
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,550
Okay.

945
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,850
Now you're just saying random things.

946
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,430
I'm silent.

947
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,910
Starting when I feel like...

948
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,590
You know...

949
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,950
All I'm saying...

950
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,210
Why do I have to ask them?

951
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,730
When they can tell me.

952
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,070
Check out...

953
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,730
Check out this rare creature.

954
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,390
I fished up at the sea.

955
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,830
It's a sound team.

956
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,390
Not...

957
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,810
What the fuck?

958
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,030
Jesus.

959
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,630
He gets to catch that?

960
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,990
I can't catch anything.

961
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,590
Oh shit.

962
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,390
I should not have made him go into that fight.

963
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,050
Whoops.

964
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,030
Oh.

965
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,590
Okay.

966
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,690
I forgot that.

967
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,930
I forgot he's fire type.

968
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,630
Rough skin.

969
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,990
Okay.

970
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,550
He'll live.

971
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,390
Dad will live.

972
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,350
I believe.

973
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,110
I wish it was Pokemon Coliseum time.

974
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,070
And I could just catch it.

975
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,710
Oh wait.

976
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,150
Oh.

977
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:45,630
Um.

978
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:46,530
Oh.

979
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,110
Don't worry.

980
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,710
He'll live.

981
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,210
Oh shit.

982
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:48,830
The rough skin.

983
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,430
Don't worry.

984
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,170
I can survive.

985
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:50,630
Oh.

986
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,920
Guys.

987
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,120
It's okay.

988
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,060
It's okay.

989
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,960
I forgot.

990
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,440
I was like.

991
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:01,980
Don't worry.

992
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,480
He'll live.

993
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,780
And then I realized he has.

994
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,820
It's okay.

995
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,180
I must have one revive here.

996
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,860
There has to be one revive.

997
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,140
Oh.

998
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,960
A one of the kind that revives.

999
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,280
Okay.

1000
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:12,860
There we go.

1001
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,240
Okay.

1002
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,660
It's a.

1003
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,720
It's a one of a.

1004
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,060
Wait.

1005
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,520
Is there another?

1006
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,220
Do I have any other?

1007
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,300
Okay.

1008
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,920
Wait.

1009
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,060
What?

1010
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,600
If I use a rare candy now.

1011
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,380
Oh.

1012
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:22,760
I can't.

1013
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,020
Okay.

1014
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm gonna say.

1015
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,860
If he levels up.

1016
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,920
He'll be back to life.

1017
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,680
All right.

1018
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,580
Okay.

1019
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:27,820
This.

1020
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,620
I need this.

1021
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,000
Don't waste it.

1022
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,180
It's not a waste if it's towards that.

1023
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,240
It's not a waste.

1024
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,440
No.

1025
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,840
I know it works out of combat.

1026
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,340
But I was like.

1027
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,460
Maybe it'll be different.

1028
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:46,900
You know.

1029
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,380
Like.

1030
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,160
Maybe it'll work here.

1031
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:50,940
All right.

1032
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,000
Look.

1033
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,720
It's time.

1034
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,000
You know what to do.

1035
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,840
Dragoon.

1036
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,640
You know how to end this.

1037
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,200
You know exactly how to end it.

1038
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,680
All right.

1039
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,740
Oh, wait.

1040
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Can you learn?

1041
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,960
Block?

1042
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,080
You don't need that.

1043
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,320
I'll attack, baby.

1044
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,980
We do our job.

1045
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,180
Nice.

1046
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,200
Here's your plastic purple coins.

1047
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:21,980
Thank you.

1048
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,660
I deserve it.

1049
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,680
All right.

1050
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,300
Let's go.

1051
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,000
Here.

1052
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,360
Don't worry.

1053
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,460
You like it rough.

1054
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,340
On the tongue.

1055
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,040
Okay.

1056
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,340
Wait.

1057
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,280
Get that Yoshi whistle in here.

1058
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,900
Oh!

1059
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,820
Waluigi!

1060
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,740
That's why it's purple coin!

1061
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,540
Oh my god.

1062
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,700
The actual good character is here.

1063
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:46,860
Woo!

1064
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Walking through all this rings sure is exhausting.

1065
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,300
All right.

1066
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,400
The corner.

1067
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,020
All right.

1068
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Send out the wiggler.

1069
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,960
Oh, wait.

1070
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,940
Oh, the wiggler's in here!

1071
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,120
I love the wiggler!

1072
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,980
I wonder if he can, like, get angry.

1073
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,220
Finally.

1074
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,480
Best character they ever made.

1075
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,680
What the fuck?

1076
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,160
How did he survive that?

1077
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,460
I'm, like, almost 10 levels above you.

1078
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,460
I'm literally, like, beating up a child.

1079
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,860
All right.

1080
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,040
All right.

1081
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,480
Here you go.

1082
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,500
Two times.

1083
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,740
That's right.

1084
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,980
You ain't doing shit!

1085
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,380
Who's that flame whale?

1086
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,940
Oh, he gets mad if you crit it?

1087
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh, that's cute!

1088
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,080
That's a cute feature.

1089
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,900
I like that.

1090
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:52,380
Also, this egg I brought along of, like, of the child you made is still, like, not hatching.

1091
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,760
Like, I don't understand.

1092
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,880
How is your egg still an egg?

1093
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,060
I've been walking around for so fucking long.

1094
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,080
Oh, my God, it's a clef.

1095
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,900
It's the iron.

1096
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,340
Oh, wait.

1097
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,580
I don't know why I put...

1098
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,060
I don't know why I put fire here.

1099
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,640
It's taking out your dad for the wiggler.

1100
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,000
Thank you for the super chat, Absol.

1101
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,440
Thank you.

1102
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,120
Thank you.

1103
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,080
All right.

1104
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,480
Surely...

1105
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,800
Surely...

1106
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,540
Fighting move is how you kill it, right?

1107
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,940
Fucking knew it.

1108
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,440
I still don't remember my type advantages, guys.

1109
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,700
That's right.

1110
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,220
Why the fuck are you taunting me?

1111
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,480
If you're just gonna die anyway.

1112
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:37,780
Yay!

1113
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,930
I better get out of here!

1114
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:49,810
What?

1115
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,030
Purple coins?

1116
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,730
Oh, sorry.

1117
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,570
Here you go.

1118
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,810
Yay, my purple coins.

1119
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,210
This here is the recently built Smile Square.

1120
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,070
It's supposed to be a symbol of friendship amongst the citizens of Main Street.

1121
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,070
But these two ruffians are bringing nothing but bad.

1122
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:06,870
Bad fives.

1123
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,530
I don't know what to do.

1124
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,770
Who's the ruffians?

1125
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,910
They all want to fucking fight me.

1126
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,250
So I don't know who's the bad guy.

1127
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,290
Hey, Mario.

1128
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,390
It's me.

1129
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,030
Photo.

1130
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,190
Yeah, take a picture.

1131
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:20,550
Yay!

1132
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:23,250
Check me out on Blue Sky.

1133
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,010
Yay!

1134
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,510
Okay.

1135
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,430
Nice.

1136
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,350
I got a damp rock.

1137
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,210
It's just...

1138
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,190
A rock that...

1139
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,470
A rock that has been...

1140
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,270
Arena.

1141
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:36,970
Nice.

1142
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,090
I can get that anywhere.

1143
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,890
No, when can I swim?

1144
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,110
Oh my god.

1145
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,910
This Yoshi is too fast.

1146
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,210
Oh my...

1147
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:47,550
Please.

1148
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:48,850
Please.

1149
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,370
Let me...

1150
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:49,770
Please!

1151
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,570
Okay.

1152
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,690
I'm getting off the Yoshi.

1153
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,850
I'm sorry.

1154
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,830
He's way too fast.

1155
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,590
I...

1156
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,830
It's so...

1157
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,630
It's actually like really difficult to control for some fucking reason.

1158
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,210
Oh!

1159
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,430
These two ruffians!

1160
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,450
No way!

1161
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,410
Us Koopas are way better suited for the role.

1162
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,050
I mean, have you seen Lord Bowser?

1163
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,830
He's called the king of the Koopas.

1164
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,010
For a reason.

1165
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,830
Power to the people, I say.

1166
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,750
And by people, I mean Goombas.

1167
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,810
Goombas are just as good as Koopas.

1168
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,550
Okay, I'm sorry.

1169
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,710
But like...

1170
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,730
Is this like...

1171
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,210
Is this like a species war right now?

1172
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,410
Private Goomba...

1173
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,450
Are you listening?

1174
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,930
Bowser is called king of the Koopas!

1175
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:44,510
As such, only a Koopa is fit to be a Lord Bowser's right-hand minion.

1176
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,370
But Corporal Parpa...

1177
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,250
Parpa-Paraplank?

1178
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,950
That's just plain unfair.

1179
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,590
The majority of Lord...

1180
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,090
It's like...

1181
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,590
What is it called?

1182
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,290
The Reds?

1183
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,770
You know like in that musical where they're like through the snaps and it's a turf war?

1184
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,770
Oh my god, it's a turf war!

1185
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,910
The majority of Lord Bowser's minions aren't even Koopas!

1186
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,210
I don't see what's wrong with a Goomba like me taking up a leadership position.

1187
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,670
I mean...

1188
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,230
Didn't you see Captain Goomba?

1189
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,590
Yeah, Jets vs.

1190
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,170
Sharks.

1191
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,010
Oh my god, this is West Side Story.

1192
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,410
And then they're gonna fall in love.

1193
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,570
And then they're gonna kiss.

1194
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,790
He did a great job leading us minions a while back against Fawful.

1195
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,110
Captain Goomba just got lucky.

1196
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,630
A minion in the right time and place.

1197
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,890
That could have just easily been a Koopa.

1198
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,530
Oh, we're getting nowhere with this.

1199
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,310
We're Surgeon Guy when we need him to be a tiebreaker.

1200
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,490
Hey, wait a minute.

1201
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,670
Is that Mario?

1202
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,110
You're right!

1203
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,330
Come on!

1204
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,490
We have to defeat him for Lord Bowser!

1205
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,970
Oh my god, this is it!

1206
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:58,930
I am their...

1207
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,450
I am their moment where they fight together.

1208
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,150
And then like friendship.

1209
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,750
And then maybe more.

1210
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,130
Wait a minute.

1211
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,310
Parablanck!

1212
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:09,910
Look, this is exactly what we needed.

1213
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,530
Tokyo can be our unbiased third party.

1214
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:14,930
Really?

1215
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,290
I really think we should use this chance to defeat him.

1216
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,450
But I also really want to be proven right.

1217
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,590
Mario!

1218
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,470
What group of minions do you think is more fit to be Lord Bowser's right hand minion?

1219
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,450
Koopas, of course, right?

1220
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,770
No way.

1221
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,210
Koombas for sure.

1222
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,410
Right, Mario?

1223
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,410
What group of Bowser's minions do you think is the most suited to be his right hand minion?

1224
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,450
Alright, guys.

1225
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,350
Are we Koopas or Goombas?

1226
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,010
I will have to say Goombas are weaker.

1227
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,230
Because I can literally just step on him.

1228
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,050
I...

1229
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,350
Okay.

1230
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,570
Valverine, thank you for the super chat.

1231
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,030
Thank you.

1232
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,650
Thank you.

1233
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,730
Papa Smer.

1234
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:56,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1235
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,110
Thank you.

1236
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:57,670
Thank you.

1237
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,310
If Doki's being this freaking out Thursday, we'll be epic.

1238
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,490
Alright.

1239
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,390
Koopas?

1240
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,330
I would say Koopas too.

1241
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,310
Okay.

1242
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:06,890
Why...

1243
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,030
Alright.

1244
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,530
Goomba Enjoyers.

1245
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,070
Why do you like Goombas more than Koopas?

1246
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,810
Please, enlighten me.

1247
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,050
Give me your reasons why...

1248
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,930
Why you think Koombas are better.

1249
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,830
Make your case.

1250
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,070
Because they're funny to sabotage Bowser.

1251
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,710
Just because it sounds like good.

1252
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,070
They're just little guys.

1253
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:36,970
Okay.

1254
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,730
But like...

1255
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,270
That doesn't mean they're better.

1256
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,870
Koopas just have a pleasant shape.

1257
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,070
They look like...

1258
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,050
Okay.

1259
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,570
They look like...

1260
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,950
Like one of them was like...

1261
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,110
They have a pleasant shape.

1262
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,090
And then someone else in chat was like...

1263
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,290
They look like a pee-pee.

1264
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,810
Someone in chat said it.

1265
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:05,550
Not me.

1266
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,230
Someone else in chat said it.

1267
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,630
I didn't say it.

1268
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,270
I was just reading off of chat.

1269
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,890
I was reading off of chat.

1270
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,110
Alright.

1271
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,310
I'm gonna say...

1272
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:24,910
I'm sorry.

1273
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,830
Goombas...

1274
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,490
Goomba Enjoyers.

1275
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,250
You did not make your case.

1276
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,590
So I will choose the Koopas.

1277
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,250
I'm sorry.

1278
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,350
But like...

1279
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,310
Koopas...

1280
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,650
They come in different flavors and colors too.

1281
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,450
There's the flying Koopa.

1282
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:40,630
And there's like...

1283
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,270
The rest.

1284
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,730
There's the flying one.

1285
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,530
There's the green shell.

1286
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,770
There's the red shell.

1287
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,550
And then there's the blue shell.

1288
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,650
And then like...

1289
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,830
What does Goomba have?

1290
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,030
Goomba just wears...

1291
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,210
A funny hat.

1292
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,250
And then they also like...

1293
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,590
Stand on top of each other.

1294
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,770
To be a little taller.

1295
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,490
So...

1296
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,470
I guess Goombas can fly.

1297
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:03,490
But like...

1298
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,510
Not as cool.

1299
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,550
They're not as cool.

1300
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:06,170
Oh.

1301
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,990
Goombas only need...

1302
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,170
One form.

1303
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,150
Because it's...

1304
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,010
Perfect.

1305
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,610
But the Goomba stack...

1306
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,170
Is just several Goombas...

1307
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,330
On top of each other.

1308
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:21,370
Like...

1309
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,570
How is that special?

1310
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:25,870
All right.

1311
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,910
They're ready to peak specimen.

1312
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,390
They don't need improvement.

1313
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:30,070
All right.

1314
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:30,810
Koopa's time.

1315
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:31,450
Ha!

1316
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,070
See?

1317
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,330
I told you so.

1318
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,950
Koopa's reign supreme.

1319
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,090
I thought better of you, Mario.

1320
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,090
Looks like I have no choice but to fight.

1321
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,070
To prove the worth of all Goombas!

1322
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,430
Well.

1323
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,650
Mario's choice got you a bit upset.

1324
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:48,090
Eh?

1325
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:48,990
Private Goomb?

1326
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,850
Don't worry, Mario.

1327
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,170
I'm sure Private Goomb will be no issue for you.

1328
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,270
I can just step on him.

1329
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,510
Why fight him when I can literally just go up and then go...

1330
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,770
Ha!

1331
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:01,270
Oh, my God.

1332
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,310
He's so sad.

1333
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:02,930
Ha!

1334
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:03,270
Ha!

1335
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,590
Ha!

1336
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,270
Ha!

1337
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,810
Oh, I heard his feeling.

1338
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,010
Oh, there it is.

1339
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,630
Oh, I'm just fighting Goombas?

1340
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,750
Oh, that's easy.

1341
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,990
Oh, my God.

1342
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:11,670
That's just...

1343
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:12,750
That's just easy.

1344
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,490
I'm just fighting other Goombas.

1345
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:16,570
He's...

1346
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:17,990
Look what you did.

1347
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,550
He's crying.

1348
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:21,830
I flinched!

1349
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,050
All right.

1350
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,510
There's no way he can make me flinch a second time.

1351
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:31,710
There we go.

1352
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,710
Get out of here.

1353
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,370
Get your ass out of here.

1354
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,710
That's fucking right.

1355
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,290
Get him, boys.

1356
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:43,510
All right.

1357
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,370
Oh, I can learn...

1358
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,850
Oh, I can learn Explosion?

1359
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:46,710
Wait, is that...

1360
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,270
That's...

1361
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,810
What's that?

1362
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:48,230
Normal.

1363
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,710
Inflicts severe damage, but makes the user fade.

1364
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,750
Oh, I like...

1365
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,150
Ha!

1366
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,090
Let me get...

1367
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:54,670
All right.

1368
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,550
Let's get through it.

1369
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:58,470
Um...

1370
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,570
Let's get away.

1371
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,730
Oh, which one?

1372
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,270
Ah!

1373
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,650
I like that this one always gets a critical hit.

1374
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,610
Um...

1375
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,090
Glory Accurate.

1376
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,170
You're good.

1377
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:12,330
Oh, man.

1378
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,330
I don't know.

1379
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,190
Okay.

1380
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,190
We'll do Vital Throw.

1381
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:16,770
We're getting...

1382
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:16,870
Yeah.

1383
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:17,990
We'll get rid of Vital Throw.

1384
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,250
One, two, and...

1385
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:21,530
Poof!

1386
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:22,990
Yeah!

1387
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:26,870
Okay.

1388
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,430
Dragoon gained a level 28.

1389
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,930
Valvery.

1390
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1391
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:31,330
Thank you.

1392
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:31,710
Thank you.

1393
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,050
Kick her back, Goomb!

1394
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,670
For the glory of all Goomba lovers!

1395
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,190
Oh, that's gonna...

1396
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:37,370
Okay.

1397
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,570
I'm gonna send...

1398
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,330
All right.

1399
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,290
Effley, you get in there so you can be fodder for...

1400
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,190
You can get hit so I can heal...

1401
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,210
I can heal dad.

1402
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:49,710
Don't worry.

1403
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,230
Oh, my God.

1404
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:50,650
He...

1405
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,390
That's just him, but he can fly.

1406
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:54,510
Is that what he levels up to?

1407
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,790
It's just the same guy, but he has wings.

1408
00:46:58,410 --> 00:46:58,950
All right.

1409
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,130
Do I have anything that heals?

1410
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,070
Oh, did I use it all?

1411
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:03,690
God.

1412
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,190
Fuck.

1413
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,570
Okay.

1414
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,630
Wait, no.

1415
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,210
I have berries.

1416
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,970
Oh, only in battle.

1417
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:09,730
God damn it.

1418
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,570
Okay, this is bad.

1419
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,070
I don't have any heals.

1420
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:12,650
Uh-oh.

1421
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,210
I forgot to buy heals.

1422
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,250
That's fine.

1423
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,250
I believe in you.

1424
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,030
I believe in you.

1425
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:24,310
Okay.

1426
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,150
This is a little bad when I put it...

1427
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,710
Put it all in on dad.

1428
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:30,650
This is a little...

1429
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,290
Oh-oh.

1430
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,170
Whoops.

1431
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,410
All right.

1432
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,230
It's okay.

1433
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,170
Wait.

1434
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,510
I have Ultra Shroom.

1435
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,010
Oh, I do.

1436
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:42,630
I didn't see.

1437
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,190
Okay.

1438
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:44,810
It's all right.

1439
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:46,890
I'll kill him.

1440
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:47,650
Okay.

1441
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,610
I'm just gonna kill him.

1442
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,530
So, uh...

1443
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,310
Half-Ligoon can still level up.

1444
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,050
Nice.

1445
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:54,490
Yay!

1446
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,040
Oh, you can get...

1447
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,140
Okay.

1448
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:00,860
Oh, I can fly!

1449
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,300
Uh, 90.

1450
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,640
Let's see.

1451
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,800
Let's get rid of Metal Claw.

1452
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,180
Because that's a 50 move.

1453
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,740
We don't need that.

1454
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:10,860
Yay!

1455
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,060
All right.

1456
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,700
We gotta swap to another...

1457
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:18,420
Shield.

1458
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,580
You know what?

1459
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:23,640
Okay.

1460
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:23,920
No.

1461
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,000
I was gonna say you're level 25.

1462
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,480
Hi, you're level 25!

1463
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,820
Why are you, like...

1464
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,140
So behind, everybody?

1465
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:32,780
Okay.

1466
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,320
Strolling.

1467
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,520
All right.

1468
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,280
Let me...

1469
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,820
Where's that big mushroom?

1470
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,580
Oh, Ultra Shroom.

1471
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,060
There you go.

1472
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:38,880
Okay.

1473
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,200
Nice.

1474
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:39,720
All right.

1475
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,680
That's good.

1476
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,800
All right.

1477
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,560
Go and get...

1478
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,600
Go get it, dad.

1479
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:46,800
Okay.

1480
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,780
I should really...

1481
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,220
Thank God I did not use...

1482
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,620
Did not set out dad here.

1483
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,440
Because he was...

1484
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:52,740
All right.

1485
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,600
You know what to do.

1486
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,360
You know...

1487
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,320
You know what to do.

1488
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:00,780
Okay.

1489
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,840
That's...

1490
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,400
Oh my God.

1491
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:02,740
Good.

1492
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,100
Okay.

1493
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,120
That was planned.

1494
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,140
That...

1495
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,640
That was...

1496
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,800
Guys, that was planned.

1497
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,740
That was exactly planned.

1498
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,760
Don't keep...

1499
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,700
Believe me sometimes.

1500
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,480
I...

1501
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,660
You lick when I tell you to lick.

1502
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,280
You never stop licking.

1503
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,820
That is the only move that I shall make you do.

1504
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,660
She...

1505
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,520
She ran the calculations.

1506
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,080
Yes, ma'am.

1507
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,760
That's right.

1508
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,680
Never...

1509
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,480
That's the only move you know.

1510
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,480
I don't even know why they gave us four moves in general.

1511
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,280
Lick, it's the only move you need.

1512
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:46,720
I know.

1513
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,220
Don't you know.

1514
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,420
All right.

1515
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,220
Now we send dad back out.

1516
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,680
Oh my God.

1517
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:01,920
Wait.

1518
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,240
He has a chain charm?

1519
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,220
Oh yeah?

1520
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,620
Check out my dog.

1521
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,860
You're gonna send a dog?

1522
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,840
I have my dog right here.

1523
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,420
Jesus Christ.

1524
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:13,980
That's huge.

1525
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,260
All right.

1526
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,560
Let me use...

1527
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,980
What if I just use explosion right off the bat?

1528
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,680
That's a big dog.

1529
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,000
But...

1530
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,620
What is it bigger than this?

1531
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:31,620
Oh shit.

1532
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,300
He dug a hole.

1533
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,460
Oh my God.

1534
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh my God.

1535
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,260
Uh...

1536
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:40,920
Uh...

1537
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,280
Uh...

1538
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:41,580
Well...

1539
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,440
I can't really do anything.

1540
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,320
So I'm just gonna throw a random move.

1541
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,000
Wait.

1542
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,020
How strong is...

1543
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,640
Is he weak against...

1544
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,000
Is he weak against fighting?

1545
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,100
I can't tell.

1546
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,000
Let's try.

1547
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,740
Oh shit.

1548
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,300
It is.

1549
00:50:59,480 --> 00:50:59,620
Okay.

1550
00:50:59,740 --> 00:50:59,940
Nice.

1551
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,420
That's right.

1552
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,420
Can't take your way out of this.

1553
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:11,870
That's right.

1554
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:13,790
Power block.

1555
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,310
You were supposed to help me take that Mario.

1556
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,290
That's right.

1557
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:20,950
Can't believe you...

1558
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:21,510
That's right.

1559
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,870
This is to all you Goomba lovers out there.

1560
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,030
An ant is still an ant.

1561
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:27,790
No way.

1562
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,750
How could I lose to you?

1563
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,010
For lack of a better phrase.

1564
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,390
I told you so.

1565
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,210
Koopas are Lord Bowser's most powerful minions.

1566
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,550
You'll pay for this, paraplomb.

1567
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,410
Our revenge will kill.

1568
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,850
What are you gonna do?

1569
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,950
A million ants is still like...

1570
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:52,750
It's still just one million ants.

1571
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:53,310
It's like...

1572
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,750
It's like the whole one man versus...

1573
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,810
One gorilla versus...

1574
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,070
A hundred men.

1575
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,490
You're like...

1576
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,070
One doki versus a million ants.

1577
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,210
You'll still not...

1578
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,150
You'll still won't win.

1579
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,410
I'll just step on all of you.

1580
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:08,950
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

1581
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,810
Thanks for helping prove the might of Koopas, Mario.

1582
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,450
Here.

1583
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,190
I'll give you this as a way of showing just how grateful I am.

1584
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,170
Yay.

1585
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:21,770
Temporary.

1586
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,070
Welcome to the tomato farm.

1587
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:23,910
Welcome, welcome.

1588
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,690
Don't expect this sort of treatment from now on, though.

1589
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:30,990
And make sure not to tell Lord Bowser about what happened here.

1590
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,750
He died doing what he loved.

1591
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:34,810
Goombing.

1592
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:35,710
Absolute.

1593
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1594
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:37,130
Thank you.

1595
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,830
Thank you.

1596
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,270
I remember, like, someone...

1597
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,590
Oh, I should heal.

1598
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,550
Someone, uh...

1599
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,510
Made a tweet.

1600
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:46,590
Wait, what was it?

1601
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,370
Wait, I need to find it.

1602
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:48,370
It was actually pretty silly.

1603
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,310
Let me see if I can find this tweet.

1604
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:50,870
I even...

1605
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:51,730
I bookmarked it.

1606
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:55,770
I think...

1607
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,270
I don't remember if I liked the tweet or I bookmarked it.

1608
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:02,090
But it was, like, something related to, like, uh, one...

1609
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,710
One man versus, like, one...

1610
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,210
Oh, yeah.

1611
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,930
It's basically, like, uh...

1612
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,270
Someone posted a clip of a bug's life.

1613
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:16,650
And...

1614
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:20,650
And they're, like, wow, I didn't realize bug's life got this political.

1615
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,070
And then, um...

1616
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:29,250
And then someone in there was, like, It's a metaphor for how a hundred men can easily beat the gorilla.

1617
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,230
Because it's the same argument.

1618
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,470
It's like...

1619
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,250
The crickets or the locusts are, like...

1620
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,630
Are, like, we can't let this...

1621
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,830
You can't handle a million ants.

1622
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,270
Yeah.

1623
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,010
But I'm not a cricket.

1624
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,390
I'm a grown human being.

1625
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,930
I can handle a million ants.

1626
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:49,790
I...

1627
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,470
I like how...

1628
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,370
It's a metaphor for how a hundred men can easily beat the gorilla.

1629
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,090
All right.

1630
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,190
Back to our...

1631
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,250
Back to our...

1632
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,770
Back to Mario.

1633
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,030
Finally, we have food.

1634
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:18,150
All right.

1635
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:18,850
Nice.

1636
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,710
Yeah, I want to see if there's, like, anything here.

1637
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,250
That I haven't caught yet.

1638
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,890
Oh, the jabble.

1639
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,150
Okay, I know, like...

1640
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,090
I know, like...

1641
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,910
Okay, but I don't think ants know how to, like, suffocate a...

1642
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:39,870
A human being.

1643
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,650
I don't think they're smart enough for that.

1644
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,770
Jokey, look up bullet ants and retract your statement.

1645
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,710
Not so dead, bullet.

1646
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,010
Thank you for the super chat.

1647
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:50,390
Thank you.

1648
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:50,850
Thank you.

1649
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,170
Okay, I'm not...

1650
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,970
Okay, I'm not fucking fighting a fucking bullet ant.

1651
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,250
I meant, like, the regular ants you find outside your backyard.

1652
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,230
Like, I'm not gonna go to the fucking Amazon...

1653
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,050
Amazon jungle to fight a million ants.

1654
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:05,610
I'm going...

1655
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:09,150
I meant backyard ants right outside my neighborhood.

1656
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,770
You never showered.

1657
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,690
Hey there.

1658
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,450
Hey there!

1659
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,630
Interested in making it to the main trail of pain that arranges some to the guard?

1660
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,050
Well, have I got the deal for you!

1661
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:26,910
For just a hundred quons, I'll let you surf across this water here on a Koopa shell!

1662
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,930
No need for subsequent payments either.

1663
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,370
You can use them as much as you like.

1664
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,130
Great choice, mister!

1665
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,050
Nice, I got a Koopa shell.

1666
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,450
Have fun!

1667
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:40,450
Thanks.

1668
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,610
I don't even know when a guard said not let me in.

1669
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,030
Oh my god, it's the poison shrewblet!

1670
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,050
Alright, let's get him out of here.

1671
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,610
He's not worth my time.

1672
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,790
Oh, I got a party cap!

1673
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,670
Alright, who wants to wear the party hat?

1674
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,390
You're almost a town!

1675
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,510
Don't give up!

1676
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,630
But first, let me beat you up first!

1677
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,310
Don't give up!

1678
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,500
Alright, horned ant.

1679
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,760
Oh, speaking of ants.

1680
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,200
Okay, if a million ants like wore a fucking helmet.

1681
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,280
Oh my god!

1682
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,460
They wore a helmet so I can't step on them!

1683
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,740
They're evolving!

1684
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,120
They turned up the plan!

1685
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,580
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

1686
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,680
Thank you, thank you.

1687
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,660
Tokyo hands covered in honey versus one million firehands.

1688
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,340
The matchup of the year.

1689
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,960
Live at the Wrestle...

1690
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,800
WrestleTuber SuperSlam.

1691
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,160
They bombed.

1692
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,660
I can't believe it!

1693
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,200
They know the plan!

1694
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,100
A million thumbtacks.

1695
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,820
Fucking ants.

1696
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,660
Can't trust.

1697
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,300
Who leaked?

1698
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,360
Who leaked to the ants?

1699
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,240
My plan!

1700
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,400
Who was it?

1701
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,840
Was it you Goomba sympathizers?

1702
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,320
I fucking knew it!

1703
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,020
I knew you Goomba sympathizers would betray me!

1704
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,680
I fucking knew it!

1705
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,740
She's on to us.

1706
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,180
You cowards.

1707
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,640
I did it for private Goomba.

1708
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,160
That was a great battle!

1709
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,060
Yeah!

1710
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,560
You're gonna need this if you ever want to make it into town!

1711
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:39,940
This.

1712
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,020
You got...

1713
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,200
Gotta pay the toll of what it goes through!

1714
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,660
Now then, do you have the purple coins right here or not?

1715
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,740
420...

1716
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,440
Oh my god.

1717
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,040
I could have been able to afford it if I didn't pay this fucking...

1718
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,680
If I didn't pay him money.

1719
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,240
We're anti-Koopas.

1720
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,340
Oh my god.

1721
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,300
He tried to extort me just now.

1722
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,100
Oh well.

1723
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,280
Yeah, I could surf now.

1724
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,100
Yeah!

1725
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,540
Oh my god.

1726
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,220
These fucking...

1727
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,500
I keep getting stick bugged.

1728
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,520
Get Skeetered!

1729
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,620
Stop Skeetering me!

1730
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,220
Okay, but is there anything here?

1731
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,420
Any unique...

1732
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:27,700
Oh!

1733
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,180
What the...

1734
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:28,780
Heave Ho?

1735
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,440
Oh!

1736
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,180
I remember these guys!

1737
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,080
Okay, I need something that...

1738
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,140
Doesn't kill him.

1739
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,960
Alright, you know what to do, Dragoon.

1740
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,460
There's no way the Dragoon's gonna one-shot him.

1741
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,990
I want to be Ho.

1742
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:52,650
Alright.

1743
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,090
There's no what?

1744
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,190
There's no way.

1745
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,450
There's no way.

1746
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:59,650
Okay, nice.

1747
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,530
Oh my god.

1748
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,370
He's tossing me.

1749
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,330
Oh, he's tossing you guys.

1750
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:05,090
Okay, nice.

1751
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,370
I'll just keep licking him.

1752
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:07,490
Alright.

1753
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:08,710
Keep licking!

1754
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,610
You know what?

1755
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:10,990
Maybe...

1756
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,750
What if I just delete all his other moves?

1757
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,150
I just...

1758
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,550
I just give Dragoon one move.

1759
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,730
And one move only.

1760
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,070
Toki, no.

1761
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,750
Keep licking!

1762
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,370
Alright.

1763
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,650
Now we catch.

1764
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,910
Toki, please.

1765
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,500
NPC, thank you for the super chat.

1766
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:43,960
Thank you.

1767
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,660
Thank you.

1768
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,620
Hi, Toki.

1769
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,500
Finished my graduate program.

1770
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,680
So, a Toki stream is a nice reward.

1771
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1772
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:51,500
Thank you.

1773
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:51,920
Thank you.

1774
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,820
And congratulations.

1775
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,940
What did you graduate from?

1776
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,560
What major was it?

1777
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:58,800
Congratulate...

1778
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,740
Don't tell me your university.

1779
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,560
I'm not trying to dox you.

1780
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,620
I meant like...

1781
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,880
I just realized I worded it weirdly.

1782
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,900
I meant...

1783
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,500
What...

1784
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,780
What like...

1785
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,860
What major were you graduating?

1786
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,740
For it.

1787
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,180
I wasn't asking you to dox yourself.

1788
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,300
I just needed you to know that.

1789
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,140
Congratulations!

1790
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,320
I hope you...

1791
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:22,720
Um...

1792
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,180
Um...

1793
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,700
I hope you relax now.

1794
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,660
And just enjoy your free time.

1795
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,580
After graduating.

1796
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,360
Uh...

1797
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,680
A machine built to carry and launch heavy objects.

1798
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,640
If it seems anyone approaching...

1799
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,900
It'll eagerly wait for...

1800
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,340
For them to step on...

1801
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,220
To send them flying.

1802
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:38,920
And you know what?

1803
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:39,760
NPC!

1804
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,740
I will name...

1805
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,960
Heepo after you.

1806
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,820
To congratulate you.

1807
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:47,700
Okay.

1808
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,720
NPC.

1809
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:49,980
Goon.

1810
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,360
Alright.

1811
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,180
Go to the X-Out box.

1812
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,560
You go.

1813
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,000
Alright.

1814
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,460
Let's see if there's anything else here.

1815
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,020
God.

1816
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,400
It's so ugly.

1817
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,820
Alright.

1818
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,960
Let's get out of here.

1819
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,080
I don't want him.

1820
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,320
It looks fucking weird.

1821
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,540
Yay.

1822
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,200
Koopa shell.

1823
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,400
Oh my...

1824
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,940
I can't believe it.

1825
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,660
I...

1826
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,080
I...

1827
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,540
Wait.

1828
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,060
Is he rare in this game?

1829
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:42,000
Yeah?

1830
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,200
Just do you know.

1831
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,520
I've never encountered...

1832
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,460
A...

1833
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,300
I've never encountered...

1834
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,260
A Pokemon Shiny before.

1835
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,060
And that my very first Shiny...

1836
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,000
Is in...

1837
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,680
Mario...

1838
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,520
Come on.

1839
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,600
I can't believe it.

1840
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,480
I can't believe...

1841
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:04,740
Mario...

1842
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,020
What's my first Shiny?

1843
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,160
I...

1844
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,680
I...

1845
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,080
I can't...

1846
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,480
Stick bugged.

1847
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,260
I can't...

1848
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,660
Stick bugged...

1849
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,320
Shiny.

1850
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,660
Alright.

1851
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,880
What caps do I have?

1852
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,720
Okay.

1853
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,920
I have this.

1854
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,180
I only have...

1855
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,680
I can't believe it.

1856
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,740
I got...

1857
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,580
Stick bugged.

1858
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:35,760
Yay!

1859
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,960
I can't believe my first Shiny...

1860
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,680
Ever in my...

1861
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,160
It is a 1 to...

1862
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,540
I can't believe it.

1863
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,420
It's a 1 out of...

1864
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,980
4,000 chance.

1865
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,120
Alright.

1866
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:57,260
I...

1867
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,160
Stick bugged.

1868
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:02,580
Wait.

1869
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:02,940
Okay.

1870
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,820
Okay.

1871
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,580
Name it...

1872
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:12,440
I'm naming it Stick bug.

1873
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,500
I got Stick bug.

1874
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,840
I can't...

1875
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,120
I can't...

1876
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:17,580
I like...

1877
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:17,760
I'm like...

1878
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,540
Why aren't you...

1879
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,300
Why...

1880
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,080
Where's your Shiny reaction?

1881
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,100
You know like those...

1882
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,860
Pokemon...

1883
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,880
You know those Pokemon...

1884
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,800
Shiny reactions?

1885
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,220
And they're like...

1886
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:27,680
Oh my god!

1887
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:28,680
Oh my god!

1888
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,620
It's a Shiny!

1889
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,940
And then I'm just like...

1890
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,100
Because I'm disappointed at myself...

1891
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,880
That my very first Shiny ever...

1892
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,460
Was in Mario...

1893
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,980
And it was a fucking...

1894
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:43,140
And it was a fucking...

1895
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:43,840
Stick bug...

1896
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,460
I can't...

1897
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,220
I can't believe it...

1898
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,600
I can't believe it...

1899
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,700
I bought Stick bug...

1900
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,220
Even with a Shiny...

1901
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:58,800
I...

1902
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,400
I...

1903
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,980
No!

1904
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,180
This is my first Shiny ever!

1905
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,480
Not like this...

1906
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,950
Congrats on the Shiny Stick bug...

1907
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:16,090
Alright.

1908
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:18,750
Deserved.

1909
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,210
This is part of your history.

1910
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:25,530
My first shiny.

1911
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,230
I can't believe it.

1912
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:31,310
Okay.

1913
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:33,670
I'm gonna make sure if there's anything here.

1914
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,690
Oh.

1915
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,710
What's my luck?

1916
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,290
What is my luck?

1917
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:44,030
Nobody forgets their first time.

1918
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,030
No!

1919
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:49,310
My first time was a gun stick bite.

1920
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,510
Alright.

1921
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:53,570
It's time to lick.

1922
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,430
It's time to lick.

1923
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:00,210
The first times are often filled with disappointment.

1924
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:04,270
Alright.

1925
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:05,950
It's time to lick the mask.

1926
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:08,350
It's okay.

1927
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,190
Same shaming.

1928
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,670
Oh my god.

1929
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:18,310
It drained.

1930
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:21,230
I can't use anything else.

1931
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,070
It's literally like my weakest move.

1932
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:25,870
Okay.

1933
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:26,770
Maybe...

1934
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,750
Oh my god.

1935
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:28,830
It's kissing back though.

1936
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:29,890
He likes it.

1937
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:32,590
Okay.

1938
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:32,990
Okay.

1939
01:05:32,990 --> 01:05:34,010
Maybe... I'll try bite.

1940
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:36,790
Okay.

1941
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:37,270
Bite.

1942
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,030
Okay.

1943
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:41,370
Nice.

1944
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,810
Okay.

1945
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:42,350
Not bite.

1946
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,070
Maybe like...

1947
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,470
I feel like that's just gonna kill him.

1948
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:51,630
I'll try.

1949
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:53,030
I'll try.

1950
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:56,510
Fuck.

1951
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:58,170
No!

1952
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,870
Please don't be a rare encounter!

1953
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:03,490
Okay.

1954
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:03,830
You're right.

1955
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,350
I should save.

1956
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:08,840
Okay.

1957
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,820
Oh my god.

1958
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,320
I can't believe it.

1959
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,640
Oh, they're pretty common?

1960
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,060
Okay.

1961
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:15,960
Because I haven't found...

1962
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,140
Okay.

1963
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:16,560
You're right.

1964
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,080
Alright.

1965
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:17,960
The moment it...

1966
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:18,240
Okay.

1967
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,040
We're gonna have to get rid of...

1968
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,000
Do we have any water?

1969
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,480
We don't, right?

1970
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,000
The moment...

1971
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,420
The moment this guy hatches...

1972
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,660
Then we can get rid...

1973
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,700
We can put...

1974
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,540
Put him in.

1975
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:33,860
Okay.

1976
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:36,740
Whoa!

1977
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,660
Hand fake?

1978
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,200
There's so many unique marans here.

1979
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,680
Oh, you're right.

1980
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,660
I have to reconfigure my entire team.

1981
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,360
Ugh!

1982
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,940
I don't have like any...

1983
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,480
I don't have any weak ones...

1984
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,360
For this.

1985
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,080
This is a rare...

1986
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,680
This is a rare encounter?

1987
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:00,780
Oh!

1988
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:03,820
Okay.

1989
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:04,960
I'll stun it then.

1990
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,040
Oh, it doesn't affect him.

1991
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,280
Okay.

1992
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:07,780
That's bad.

1993
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:11,620
Alright.

1994
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,900
I'm gonna see if I'm...

1995
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,580
I'm gonna use a normal ball first...

1996
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,600
And see like...

1997
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,860
How bad it is.

1998
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,420
Oh, nice!

1999
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,160
Yay!

2000
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,360
I didn't have to do anything!

2001
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,040
Alright.

2002
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:30,480
Nice.

2003
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,280
Easy.

2004
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,320
A black ooze in the shape of a hand.

2005
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,680
I'll make a sign of anyone it wishes to become.

2006
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,420
Taking its stats and moves.

2007
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,780
It loves to finger paint.

2008
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,500
Alright.

2009
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,360
Who wants to be hand fake?

2010
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,300
Who wants to be a giant fucking hand?

2011
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:49,180
Yes, dark type.

2012
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:50,200
Streamer love.

2013
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:50,600
Yay!

2014
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,340
Can that be the hand Eon spoon?

2015
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,340
Of course you can!

2016
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:56,480
Thank you for the super chat.

2017
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:56,840
Thank you.

2018
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:57,580
Thank you.

2019
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,200
My select.

2020
01:07:59,520 --> 01:07:59,680
Oops.

2021
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,780
It's just gonna be E.

2022
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,380
I almost just made it E.

2023
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:03,700
Yuck.

2024
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,600
Alright.

2025
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,220
Nice.

2026
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:08,920
Exile!

2027
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:10,940
Okay.

2028
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,440
We just need to find the mask guy.

2029
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,340
We need the mask guy in our party.

2030
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,380
Oh, there he is!

2031
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:16,880
Alright.

2032
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,920
Maybe I'll just throw it.

2033
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:18,960
I'm just gonna throw it.

2034
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,680
It'd be the goon hand to help out.

2035
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:22,820
Help the team out.

2036
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:26,280
Alright.

2037
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,140
Baseball cap.

2038
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,120
Ah, thank you for the raid!

2039
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,260
Thank you, thank you!

2040
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,900
Let's use another one.

2041
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,880
Yeah, the PC box is getting a little freaky.

2042
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,250
Alright.

2043
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,370
Another boss.

2044
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:46,610
Yay!

2045
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:51,770
Yay!

2046
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,290
I don't wanna do anything!

2047
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,670
Alright.

2048
01:08:58,770 --> 01:08:59,630
What is his description?

2049
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,770
A mask has found guarding treasure.

2050
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,650
People seek out areas where it is found.

2051
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:05,650
As riches are known to be lurking nearby.

2052
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:06,650
Wait.

2053
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:07,930
That means there's a treasure nearby.

2054
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:12,840
Alright.

2055
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,260
Who wanted me?

2056
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:13,900
Phantos.

2057
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,740
Oh, is it Dark Fairy?

2058
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,440
Ooh.

2059
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,480
Oh my gosh.

2060
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,200
I have to readjust my entire party.

2061
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:22,860
It is...

2062
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,060
Persona 5.

2063
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:24,960
Oh my god!

2064
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:25,760
No.

2065
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,100
I don't think they're gonna release a new persona as long as time.

2066
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,700
They gotta milk the last persona game for like 10 more years, guys.

2067
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:34,280
Oh.

2068
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,800
They can still milk Persona 5 for 10 more years.

2069
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,980
It's just like GTA 5.

2070
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,660
Alright, who wants to be the mask?

2071
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,320
It's been 8 already?

2072
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,560
Yeah, that's what I mean.

2073
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,700
On the 20th anniversary, they'll release Persona 6.

2074
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:13,940
Alright.

2075
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,840
Me.

2076
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:16,600
Okay.

2077
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,020
Do we have anyone named Joker?

2078
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,120
Alright, anybody in my...

2079
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,040
Name change your name right now to something...

2080
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,980
To Joker something or Joker.

2081
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,320
And then I...

2082
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,800
Any Jokers in chat?

2083
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,620
And even me, please.

2084
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,240
Name change...

2085
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:45,000
Name change yourself right now to have Joker in it.

2086
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,500
So that I can name him Joker Goon.

2087
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,540
Genius.

2088
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,860
I'm a Joker, baby.

2089
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,480
Dude.

2090
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,280
If you want...

2091
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,740
If you want a Mario mod to be named after you...

2092
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,840
If you want Phantoms to be named after you...

2093
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,660
Name change yourself right now.

2094
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,540
Name...

2095
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,900
Name change...

2096
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,120
It's my...

2097
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,660
Bro, your name is J Gunslinger.

2098
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,620
It is not close enough.

2099
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,420
I know you can do it.

2100
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,620
Are you...

2101
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,140
Are you that...

2102
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,960
Are you that determined to be the mask?

2103
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,700
Name it after yourself.

2104
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,700
It's a hard pass.

2105
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,900
Then they lose their...

2106
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,020
No, that's their new...

2107
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,440
It's their new identity now.

2108
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,240
And that don't change.

2109
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,040
And then we're gonna have like...

2110
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,320
10 plus people with that name.

2111
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:41,900
And then they're like...

2112
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,060
She named that after...

2113
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:43,780
Oh, there you go.

2114
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:44,820
Joker...

2115
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,060
Joker Grad at 2016.

2116
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,060
Joker Bros.

2117
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,620
This is all for you.

2118
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,020
There we go.

2119
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:53,740
Alright.

2120
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,520
Joker Goon.

2121
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,100
There we go.

2122
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,220
We...

2123
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,520
Now we have a lot of Jokers here.

2124
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:01,980
This...

2125
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,060
This is you, guys.

2126
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,000
All you J...

2127
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,340
I'm talking about you.

2128
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,860
That specific Joker.

2129
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,500
Alright.

2130
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,320
Nice.

2131
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:13,720
Alright.

2132
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,840
Joker Goon.

2133
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,040
Yes.

2134
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:17,560
You.

2135
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:18,760
Right there.

2136
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,440
Right there.

2137
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,340
Specifically you.

2138
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,380
That I named after.

2139
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:27,920
Not so...

2140
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,120
Yes, ma'am.

2141
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,120
Joker Goon won.

2142
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,340
That's your new identity now.

2143
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,440
That's...

2144
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,280
Name change just...

2145
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,000
For...

2146
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,520
Just to be the mask.

2147
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,200
Change change just to go in the...

2148
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:47,440
Hey.

2149
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:47,940
Hey.

2150
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,080
It's a cool...

2151
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,340
It's a good box.

2152
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,320
Alright.

2153
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,060
It's a wild box.

2154
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,960
You need to sign an NDA if you want to get into this box.

2155
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,440
Oh, shit.

2156
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,880
Oh, I already have him.

2157
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:10,010
Yeah, you can have fun with John in the box.

2158
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,320
Joker Goon.

2159
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,200
Thank you for the super chat.

2160
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:17,620
Thank you.

2161
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,340
Thank you.

2162
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,010
Look at that.

2163
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,590
All my new Jokers in chat.

2164
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,830
All my new Joker Goons in chat.

2165
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,090
Dude, that one Joker Goon...

2166
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:32,670
That I specifically named after you...

2167
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:33,470
It was for you.

2168
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,170
Just you.

2169
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:37,270
Just remember that.

2170
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,270
I named...

2171
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,090
All those other Jokers...

2172
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,250
It wasn't for you.

2173
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,430
It was for you.

2174
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,310
Whoa!

2175
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,510
Someone else made it all the way out there?

2176
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:54,610
You should take a moment and rest.

2177
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:55,970
We're on 4-2.

2178
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,130
It's dangerous if you're not careful.

2179
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,010
Good luck out there.

2180
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:03,470
It's chat's Joker art.

2181
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:08,810
Champion!

2182
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2183
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:10,450
Thank you.

2184
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,150
Thank you.

2185
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:18,570
You wanna know how I got this name?

2186
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,950
Oh, 1-Up.

2187
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:25,530
Oh!

2188
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:26,490
Okay, nice.

2189
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:27,030
Oh, yeah.

2190
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,150
I should...

2191
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,910
Wait, actually, did I just...

2192
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:31,470
Did that just level up?

2193
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,550
No, he has just a little bit.

2194
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,850
Okay, he just has a little bit left.

2195
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:41,290
Oh, it's a fuzzy!

2196
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:44,010
Okay, I'm gonna catch him.

2197
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:45,770
It's a fuzzy!

2198
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,170
It's those little guys on the...

2199
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,050
On the...

2200
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:49,650
Like...

2201
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,050
Like the rail stuff.

2202
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,550
Little chains.

2203
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:55,590
Oh, wait.

2204
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:56,550
I will try one more time.

2205
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:00,750
Absol, thank you for the super chat.

2206
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:01,130
Thank you.

2207
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:01,810
Thank you.

2208
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,130
Whoa, looking cool, Joker Goon.

2209
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,630
But you look tired after day.

2210
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:06,650
Let's go to sleep.

2211
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2212
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:08,830
Thank you.

2213
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:09,310
Thank you.

2214
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,550
Okay, I'll do one more.

2215
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:11,550
I lied.

2216
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:12,750
I'm doing it one more time.

2217
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:16,010
I don't think I...

2218
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,670
I think I literally have like two more balls.

2219
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,090
No!

2220
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:24,350
Fuzzy, just get in my ball!

2221
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,910
You get to live your life in the...

2222
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:28,570
Look, I got...

2223
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,510
Oh my god, I have one more.

2224
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,270
I actually have one more.

2225
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,030
I...

2226
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:32,510
Oh no.

2227
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:34,250
I actually have one more cap left.

2228
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,330
And it's the party cap.

2229
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:38,130
I fired.

2230
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:38,710
And I fired.

2231
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:39,150
And I missed.

2232
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,250
And I fired it again.

2233
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:40,970
And I missed.

2234
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:42,370
Alright, lick time.

2235
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:46,010
It's okay.

2236
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,270
I'll just keep licking.

2237
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:50,990
This has to be it.

2238
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:52,410
He's gonna party.

2239
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:54,350
Like 2008.

2240
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,270
Join us, fuzzy.

2241
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:03,610
Join us.

2242
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,430
Party with us.

2243
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:07,970
Yay!

2244
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:11,510
Okay, I don't have any balls left.

2245
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,330
I want to be fuzzy.

2246
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,330
You don't have to name change for this one.

2247
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:20,970
Just so you guys know.

2248
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:25,510
You don't have to change your name this time.

2249
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:27,210
Um...

2250
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,490
Bug and Dark.

2251
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:30,490
Um...

2252
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:33,390
A pest that only gets more annoying with more of it.

2253
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:34,870
Very erratic in nature.

2254
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,570
Toads are advised to keep bug spray and a giant boot on them in the summer.

2255
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,450
Yeah, it's a little...

2256
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:43,290
It's like a little termite thing.

2257
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,710
It's like a little termite thing.

2258
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:47,110
Alright.

2259
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,210
Who wants to be a little fuzzy man?

2260
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:54,310
Wait.

2261
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:55,810
Maybe not?

2262
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,550
That'd be fuzzy?

2263
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,030
Of course you can, Mike.

2264
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,190
Thank you for the super chat.

2265
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,630
Thank you.

2266
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:02,410
Thank you.

2267
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:08,210
Oh, I almost just called you just M.

2268
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:09,570
Mike.

2269
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:12,850
Boone.

2270
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:14,910
Into that box you go.

2271
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:16,970
Oh, wait.

2272
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:17,630
It's box two.

2273
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:18,730
Let me readjust that.

2274
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:20,710
Okay.

2275
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:22,610
Uh...

2276
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:23,770
I'm trying to remember how to...

2277
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,550
How to get into my box.

2278
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,130
Is this.

2279
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:27,470
Okay.

2280
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:28,810
Alright.

2281
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:30,810
Let's change this.

2282
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,290
Oh, wait.

2283
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,050
No, it should be this.

2284
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:34,750
Yeah.

2285
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:36,430
Uh...

2286
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:37,630
New Pond City.

2287
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:40,830
Seafloor.

2288
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:41,310
River.

2289
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,210
Sky.

2290
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,050
The beach.

2291
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:44,610
Ooh.

2292
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:45,730
Okay.

2293
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,470
How about a cave?

2294
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,010
No, you guys deserve to be in a cave.

2295
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:51,410
Name.

2296
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,470
Alright.

2297
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:03,690
Okay.

2298
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:16,610
We don't have enough space, but you know what it means.

2299
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:23,990
Wait, wait, you're right.

2300
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,570
I could just literally call it.

2301
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:26,890
It's a cave.

2302
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:28,130
It's a...

2303
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:36,150
I have enough space for this, though.

2304
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:44,810
Alright.

2305
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:46,630
Let's...

2306
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:47,910
Uh...

2307
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:48,490
You know what?

2308
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:50,750
Let's customize the Goon Cave a little.

2309
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,020
Let's see.

2310
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:58,420
Ooh.

2311
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:00,620
The hand deserves to be in the Goon Cave.

2312
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:00,960
...

2313
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,100
Haha.

2314
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,260
Alright.

2315
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:08,920
And then...

2316
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,660
Let's see.

2317
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,040
Who else is...

2318
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:14,360
Oh, yeah.

2319
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,880
You'll be in the...

2320
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,840
You'll be in that corner, as always.

2321
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,880
And then... oh, that tongue, you get to be in the goon cave too.

2322
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,640
Let's see...

2323
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,820
I think...

2324
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,000
Alright, that's good enough.

2325
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,320
Alright, nice.

2326
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,620
Ricky, stop.

2327
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:55,580
Oh, the fish?

2328
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,660
Wait, what, have the fish with the mouth?

2329
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,420
Oh, I do.

2330
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,760
Forgot about you, pro-goon.

2331
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,860
I forgot... you think I forgot about you?

2332
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,040
You're lucky all the other dragoons didn't forget about you.

2333
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,480
Alright, nice.

2334
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:20,060
Glad I'm still in the exile box.

2335
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:23,910
Now you gotta sign two NDAs.

2336
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:26,600
Black sludge.

2337
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,180
But what... what goes over here?

2338
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,180
Think you're venturing in a glaring cave?

2339
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,160
Be careful.

2340
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,040
There's bandits everywhere.

2341
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,400
greedy money grabbers.

2342
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,440
Pretty money grabbers.

2343
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,280
Destroyed just as I saw Mon got...

2344
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,120
Wait, do I have...

2345
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,580
I don't even remember that.

2346
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,780
Soren, thank you for the super chat.

2347
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,940
Thank you, thank you.

2348
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,200
Oh, you're right.

2349
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,360
How could I be so foolish?

2350
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,440
Where is he?

2351
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,100
Oh, wait.

2352
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,140
Which one is it?

2353
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,280
A pigoon.

2354
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,380
Oh, there he is.

2355
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,420
That's why he's in the corner.

2356
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:14,780
That's...

2357
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:19,160
That's exactly why he's in the corner right now.

2358
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,940
Okay, I don't have...

2359
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:23,940
I don't have any more, right?

2360
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,180
I don't have any more caps.

2361
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,120
Okay, I should head home.

2362
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,960
Okay, we'll come back here later.

2363
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,900
Oh my gosh.

2364
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,460
I don't know.

2365
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:32,880
Okay.

2366
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,120
We'll head back.

2367
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,220
And then...

2368
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:38,400
So we can buy more caps.

2369
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:42,280
Okay, I actually don't like this area.

2370
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,240
This area confuses me too much.

2371
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,240
Okay, I forgot this is the castle.

2372
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:47,800
Whoops.

2373
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,480
Toe Town can never fail me.

2374
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,160
Bum bum bum ba da da dum.

2375
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:02,300
Bum bum bum ba da da dum.

2376
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:02,700
Oh, wait.

2377
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:03,480
They only have one.

2378
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:05,580
Oh, I need to go to that big mall.

2379
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:06,240
Never mind.

2380
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,560
Ah, I'm so stupid.

2381
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,600
I have to go to that big mall.

2382
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,040
Wait.

2383
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,400
Let's see.

2384
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,620
The big mall has the better stuff.

2385
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,460
But like, I need to remember where the fuck the mall is.

2386
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,400
Because it's such a big city.

2387
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,140
Where the heck is the mall?

2388
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,660
I feel like I have made zero progress.

2389
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,920
I've been just...

2390
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,280
I've actually been so distracted.

2391
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,230
Baseball cap.

2392
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,010
First deuce is recruited.

2393
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:44,370
On lower level.

2394
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:46,030
Oh, we should get the party hat.

2395
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,190
I feel like we should get the party hat.

2396
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:52,250
They're all so low level compared to me, right?

2397
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,850
Or do we get the baseball cap?

2398
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,550
It's time to party!

2399
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:06,690
Maybe I'll get like...

2400
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,030
I'll get like...

2401
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:08,610
Five.

2402
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:12,690
And I'll get the rest for...

2403
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,010
Baseball.

2404
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:15,510
Alright.

2405
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:16,490
That should be good.

2406
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,510
We don't need heals.

2407
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,030
I believe in dad.

2408
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,250
No heals needed.

2409
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:28,750
Warp putt.

2410
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,950
And then...

2411
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:32,670
Full town.

2412
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,330
GG, no heals.

2413
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:43,010
No need heals.

2414
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:44,470
We're invincible.

2415
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,070
I trust in dad.

2416
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,690
Yeah, we're not putting the shiny in yet.

2417
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,550
Cause I wanna...

2418
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:53,730
I won't wait until I have...

2419
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:55,130
So...

2420
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,150
I can use this now.

2421
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:57,770
I can get this.

2422
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:58,810
Yeah!

2423
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,320
I wanna...

2424
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:06,800
Uh...

2425
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,680
Hatch my egg first before we...

2426
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,540
We redo our...

2427
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,540
Our party.

2428
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:14,560
Goddamn fucking stick bug.

2429
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,460
I gotta go on land.

2430
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,880
I cannot deal with stick bug.

2431
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,020
I can't...

2432
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,480
I still can't believe that's my first shiny ever!

2433
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,480
Why?

2434
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:34,880
My very first shiny that I've ever encountered in the wild.

2435
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,160
And it had to be a stick bug.

2436
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,600
Never had a shot.

2437
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,040
Never encountered a wild shiny in Pokemon.

2438
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:51,480
I have to manually get a shiny Eevee so I can have a shiny Sylveon.

2439
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:51,700
Oh my god.

2440
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,690
Just fuck it.

2441
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:04,130
Mmm.

2442
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,910
Alright.

2443
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,210
No, this is the...

2444
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,190
This is a new mic.

2445
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:11,390
Bum bum.

2446
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:15,450
What the fuck?

2447
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,790
Why would you wanna stay?

2448
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,450
Oh, you just wanna give me a kiss.

2449
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:19,170
Mwah.

2450
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,910
Mwah.

2451
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,190
He's like, no don't leave dad.

2452
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:24,650
Let me give you a kiss.

2453
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:27,470
Okay, now I left.

2454
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:29,590
Alright.

2455
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,270
Ooh.

2456
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,070
Hey!

2457
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,450
I don't recognize you!

2458
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:38,770
Are you gonna see all the gems I found?

2459
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:42,850
Do I go through the cave or do I go up?

2460
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,810
Is the cave...

2461
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:44,270
Guys...

2462
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:45,470
Oh, what the fuck is that?

2463
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:47,390
Is the cave part of...

2464
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:48,010
Oh shit, sorry.

2465
01:25:48,170 --> 01:25:48,310
I...

2466
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:49,410
No!

2467
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:50,430
Oh no!

2468
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:51,450
Please!

2469
01:25:52,050 --> 01:25:52,470
I...

2470
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,670
Oh shit!

2471
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:55,690
I...

2472
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:57,950
Oh no!

2473
01:25:58,750 --> 01:25:59,130
I...

2474
01:25:59,130 --> 01:25:59,410
No!

2475
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:01,990
I didn't mean to do that!

2476
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,250
I...

2477
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:06,570
Wait, that's awkward.

2478
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:07,650
That...

2479
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:08,390
That...

2480
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,910
That was...

2481
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,730
That was...

2482
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,530
That was...

2483
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,330
I...

2484
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:13,630
What?

2485
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:15,990
I was trying to ask a question!

2486
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:17,330
I...

2487
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:17,970
I...

2488
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,530
I was trying to ask...

2489
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:19,870
I...

2490
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:20,910
I...

2491
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:24,410
That's not...

2492
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:25,430
Oh, that's not good.

2493
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,370
Full place.

2494
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:31,570
Let's see how it goes.

2495
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,830
I have to go back and...

2496
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:34,110
Ah!

2497
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:42,250
I don't even remember my question.

2498
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:45,070
I don't even remember my question!

2499
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,310
I...

2500
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,770
I'm so sad.

2501
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,070
He has jumped up.

2502
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,850
Like...

2503
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:52,850
Oh my god!

2504
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,750
What was I trying to say?

2505
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,530
I don't remember!

2506
01:26:58,530 --> 01:26:59,050
Hey!

2507
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,070
Oh yeah!

2508
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:06,670
Oh yeah!

2509
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:07,610
Okay, so...

2510
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:08,630
Is this part of...

2511
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,930
The area where I should be going to?

2512
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:11,580
Or like...

2513
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,390
Or is this like...

2514
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,350
An inter...

2515
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:14,890
Like...

2516
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:15,590
An intermission?

2517
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:16,890
Because I could go up.

2518
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,330
I don't know if I should go up.

2519
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,530
Or do I go through the cave?

2520
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,890
No, the cave isn't optional.

2521
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:26,090
Okay, but which one...

2522
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:27,970
Okay, you need to go through the cave.

2523
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:29,030
Okay, so...

2524
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:29,290
This...

2525
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:30,230
So...

2526
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:32,130
This is the area where I have...

2527
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,130
I can do...

2528
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:35,430
Assortingly welcome to the tomato farm.

2529
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,330
Welcome, welcome.

2530
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:37,550
Sorry, it's...

2531
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:37,790
It's okay.

2532
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,410
It happens to everyone on their first time.

2533
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:42,630
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

2534
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,690
Thank you, thank you.

2535
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:45,410
Um...

2536
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:47,390
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

2537
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:48,910
Thank you, thank you.

2538
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,910
Even you got learned.

2539
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:53,190
Scared of such strategic genius.

2540
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:55,130
I'm gonna use the path.

2541
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:55,910
I'll be right back.

2542
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,920
Still can't believe I did that.

2543
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,580
I can't believe it.

2544
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:00,320
I...

2545
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,640
I did that.

2546
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,420
I forgot what I was trying to say right after.

2547
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:07,380
Like...

2548
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,980
Why won't you let me escape?

2549
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,220
You're barely in real!

2550
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:13,260
No!

2551
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:17,420
Okay.

2552
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:24,200
Duck, Alan, Ginger, Potipo, Johnny and Mehdi.

2553
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2554
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:26,500
Thank you, thank you.

2555
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,920
Guys, I think maybe explosion was the wrong move to learn.

2556
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,420
I think...

2557
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:37,020
I think I may or may not have learned the wrong move.

2558
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:37,720
I...

2559
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:48,890
I thought, you know, when I explode, it just will hurt a little bit.

2560
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,070
I don't know why.

2561
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:53,430
I...

2562
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,150
I just assumed it would just hurt a little bit.

2563
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:58,650
Like, I didn't think it would like...

2564
01:29:58,650 --> 01:29:59,890
Cause it wasn't...

2565
01:29:59,890 --> 01:30:00,110
Okay.

2566
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:02,250
It wasn't self-destruct.

2567
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,650
Okay.

2568
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:06,550
I was thinking just cause it wasn't self-destruct that I live.

2569
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:07,550
Like, I...

2570
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,450
Cause it just says explode.

2571
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:15,830
So like, some people can survive explosions.

2572
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:16,870
Like...

2573
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,970
It's just a scratch.

2574
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:24,030
Look, I just...

2575
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:24,830
I didn't see...

2576
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,530
I didn't read the fine print.

2577
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:27,070
Okay?

2578
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:27,770
I...

2579
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,130
I didn't think I would like, explode it.

2580
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,200
Okay, let us...

2581
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,520
Let's try...

2582
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,180
Using this.

2583
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:47,820
Alright.

2584
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,500
Let's...

2585
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,440
Let's lick it.

2586
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,820
It's the only way to go.

2587
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,340
It's the...

2588
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:56,440
It's the only thing I can do.

2589
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:57,620
Just lick it.

2590
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:58,840
Yes.

2591
01:30:59,140 --> 01:30:59,300
Oh.

2592
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,520
Yeah!

2593
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,860
I paralyzed it!

2594
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:03,980
Because it was so good.

2595
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:10,860
Alright.

2596
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,780
Get in here.

2597
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,000
Plan.

2598
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,700
Are you serious?

2599
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,240
I spent so much money!

2600
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,340
Oh my god!

2601
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,320
You're so low level!

2602
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,160
I don't understand!

2603
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,260
Oh, thank god.

2604
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:37,680
Okay.

2605
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:38,420
We did it.

2606
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:38,860
Yeah!

2607
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,820
Yeah, but my party hat is like...

2608
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,480
Oh, if he's low level...

2609
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,280
It'll be fine.

2610
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,240
So I assumed it'd be fine.

2611
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,940
Okay, what's cotton spore?

2612
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,040
Oh yeah, we don't need that.

2613
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,620
You don't need to learn that.

2614
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:57,460
Ah!

2615
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,680
Look at your tongue, sir.

2616
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:02,900
Please let our tongue...

2617
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:03,260
No!

2618
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:04,200
In fact!

2619
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:07,240
You're gonna be happy about it.

2620
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:09,640
No!

2621
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,180
Vav...

2622
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,020
Vav...

2623
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:16,280
Goon...

2624
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,060
Wait, actually does...

2625
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:18,000
Does your name fit?

2626
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:19,560
Where's V?

2627
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,060
A-L-R-Y...

2628
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:24,180
A-L-R-Y...

2629
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:24,640
No, it doesn't.

2630
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,620
I'll just call you...

2631
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:26,240
Vav Goon.

2632
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:27,840
Alright.

2633
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:28,540
No!

2634
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:29,940
You're gonna be...

2635
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,400
You're gonna enjoy it!

2636
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:32,280
In fact!

2637
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,060
Go!

2638
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,560
You're gonna enjoy it in the goon cave!

2639
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,500
That's right!

2640
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,220
Toki, please!

2641
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:47,900
You're gonna live in a goon cave now!

2642
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:51,220
Because of how happy you are!

2643
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:54,960
What the fuck?

2644
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,200
What...

2645
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,260
What the fuck?

2646
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,000
Did...

2647
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,160
Did...

2648
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,060
Did cancer happen?

2649
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,480
How did he become three?

2650
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,220
What happened?

2651
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:09,560
How did they multiply?

2652
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,300
I'm scared!

2653
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,540
Mitosis!

2654
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:18,940
Oh!

2655
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:19,840
We fixed it!

2656
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:23,660
Nice!

2657
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:24,600
We fixed him!

2658
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:29,680
Alright!

2659
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,160
Yay!

2660
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:30,320
Yay!

2661
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,260
It's a wish...

2662
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:36,460
Oh!

2663
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,980
It's a wishy-washy ability!

2664
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:39,940
I was like, what the fuck happened to him?

2665
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,300
How did...

2666
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:42,120
Aw, man!

2667
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,340
I wish...

2668
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,880
I wish dad could get these levels right now!

2669
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:47,440
Aw,

2670
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,520
this sucks!

2671
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,000
Alright!

2672
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:52,820
I'm gonna do it!

2673
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,100
I'm gonna use her...

2674
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:54,320
Wait!

2675
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,440
Was he leveled up?

2676
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,600
Let us continue...

2677
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,680
Like, until we can go no longer!

2678
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,780
Not so joker-kun!

2679
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,560
Thank you for the super chat!

2680
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,680
Thank you, thank you!

2681
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,040
Yay!

2682
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,780
Oh, you're just a regular guy!

2683
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:10,340
Hey!

2684
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,580
I'm not just a regular guy!

2685
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,100
I am...

2686
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:15,740
Tokyo!

2687
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,640
I'ma check him, like...

2688
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:19,400
No, he hasn't!

2689
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,260
God damn it!

2690
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,360
He didn't level up!

2691
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,220
Aw...

2692
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:24,800
Fuck!

2693
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:25,940
Okay, that sucks!

2694
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:30,160
Okay...

2695
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:30,820
Anything here?

2696
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,120
Let's see if I...

2697
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,280
Oh, it was just to grab this item!

2698
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,340
Alright...

2699
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,360
The moment I grab this item, we...

2700
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:44,780
Uh...

2701
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,520
TP back!

2702
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:50,290
Okay...

2703
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:50,650
Nice!

2704
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:53,030
And that's it?!

2705
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:54,810
Ivan, thank you for the super chat!

2706
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:55,830
Thank you, thank you!

2707
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:56,630
Doki bird!

2708
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,110
Yeah?

2709
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,130
What about Doki bird?

2710
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:01,110
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

2711
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:02,610
Ha, ha, ha!

2712
01:35:02,710 --> 01:35:03,250
It's...

2713
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:05,410
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

2714
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:06,370
Ha, ha, ha!

2715
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:07,110
That's me!

2716
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:08,550
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

2717
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:13,590
Oh, I forgot about that guy that randomly is!

2718
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:15,750
Ha, ha, ha!

2719
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:16,390
That's me!

2720
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:21,190
True...

2721
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:23,970
I was like, what did I do?

2722
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:25,790
Jokey bird.

2723
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:31,650
I think he, like, accidentally clicked send and forgot to type the rest of his message.

2724
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:34,990
That's deep, bro.

2725
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:40,990
Oh my god, I could have healed him.

2726
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:43,690
I denied dad some XP.

2727
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,850
Because I got confused.

2728
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:50,230
Can I move this yet?

2729
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:53,670
No, I didn't.

2730
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,070
Oh, it's Bandit!

2731
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:58,970
Jordan's sad story.

2732
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:03,150
Alright.

2733
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,770
It's time to lick.

2734
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:07,710
That's right.

2735
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,150
Dragoon.

2736
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:13,250
Rice, thank you for the super chat.

2737
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:14,110
Lick time!

2738
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:16,810
Lick him!

2739
01:36:20,230 --> 01:36:23,190
Lick him until you can't no more!

2740
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:25,870
Keep licking!

2741
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:29,210
He does nothing to you!

2742
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:30,830
Keep licking!

2743
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:36,920
Lick!

2744
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,320
Oh my god, a critical hit, too.

2745
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:44,860
Meow.

2746
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:46,820
That's right!

2747
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:47,600
Lick!

2748
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,740
That's the only move you know.

2749
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,820
And that's the only move you'll use.

2750
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:01,860
Next scene, thank you for the super chat.

2751
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,660
Thank you, thank you.

2752
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,060
How do you miss?

2753
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,580
He's right there!

2754
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,660
Oh my...

2755
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:08,860
Oh, it's because he used sand attack.

2756
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,760
He actually used pocket sand on me.

2757
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,380
Don't worry.

2758
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,440
Eventually, you'll hit.

2759
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:19,000
There's sand in our eyes.

2760
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:21,120
There you go.

2761
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,040
I knew you could do it.

2762
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:25,880
My pocket sand.

2763
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:32,540
Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.

2764
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:33,480
Yeah!

2765
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,060
Alright, who wants to be a bandit?

2766
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:36,820
Alright, Ifen.

2767
01:37:36,980 --> 01:37:38,040
You get to be bandit.

2768
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,840
The one that got licked the most.

2769
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:47,800
A shy guy who steals things.

2770
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,940
Its mask shows a permanent sneaky grin.

2771
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:55,280
It is believed that half of all petty theft reports are caused by bandits.

2772
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,420
Soren, thank you for the super chat.

2773
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,600
Thank you, thank you.

2774
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,100
You get to be in the goon cave too.

2775
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,920
JD, welcome to tomato fire.

2776
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:08,760
Welcome, welcome.

2777
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:15,040
I-fing gooon.

2778
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:15,560
I-fing gooon.

2779
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:39,800
I-fing gooon.

2780
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:42,140
They have all licked you.

2781
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,280
Anson, thank you for the super chat.

2782
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:46,340
Thank you, thank you.

2783
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:50,140
Every mod I've captured so far has been licked.

2784
01:38:58,910 --> 01:39:00,210
Come on, let me out of here.

2785
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,550
Yeah, yes, it's like a taste test.

2786
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:07,270
Well, I know he tastes good.

2787
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:12,290
Bro, okay, if you want to fight, okay.

2788
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:14,430
Okay, you want to fight, okay.

2789
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:17,070
Okay, I won't use the explosion.

2790
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,390
The mark of the goon.

2791
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:26,150
He saw what the other bandit was going through and he wanted...

2792
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:27,790
He's like, come on!

2793
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:29,990
Let me be part of it.

2794
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:32,010
Let me be part of it too.

2795
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:33,130
It looked really fun.

2796
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:36,430
He saw what iPhone went through and wanted to join in.

2797
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:39,930
Okay, I leveled dad up too.

2798
01:39:40,150 --> 01:39:42,070
Since I just leveled him up in general.

2799
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:44,870
He's like, it should have been me!

2800
01:39:47,570 --> 01:39:49,410
Oh, that's cute!

2801
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:50,530
Look at him!

2802
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:52,410
Dang.

2803
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:55,010
Alright, get in here.

2804
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,490
A small bat!

2805
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,060
Look.

2806
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,380
Look at those eyes.

2807
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:08,940
He saw.

2808
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:11,560
He saw.

2809
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,260
He saw.

2810
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,920
What I did.

2811
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:24,430
He tried to protect himself, but you can't protect yourself from this.

2812
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:26,590
Oh, Zero!

2813
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:27,730
Thank you for the super chat!

2814
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:28,630
Thank you, thank you!

2815
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:31,010
They couldn't pass it to the whole class.

2816
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,550
Alright, who wants to be...

2817
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:35,270
Who wants to be Fang?

2818
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:37,150
A rotund bat.

2819
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:39,270
It favors damp caverns.

2820
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:45,030
It flies in elaborate patterns and leaves behind delicate air currents that resemble dotted lines.

2821
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:46,030
Let's see.

2822
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,150
Doki bird is the word.

2823
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:50,730
Bye!

2824
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:51,770
Thank you for the super chat!

2825
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:52,710
Thank you, thank you!

2826
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:55,250
Uh...

2827
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:56,170
Not me!

2828
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:58,210
Not like me!

2829
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:00,610
Okay.

2830
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:02,190
Man-goon.

2831
01:41:02,230 --> 01:41:03,230
I liked your comment.

2832
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:05,290
Man-goon.

2833
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,270
You get to be Fang.

2834
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,590
You've seen things.

2835
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,810
Man-goon.

2836
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:13,110
Into the goon cave you go.

2837
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:15,670
Oh, I got Big Nugget.

2838
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,620
Alright, I leave.

2839
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:26,860
I saw.

2840
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,680
Joker, thank you for the super chat!

2841
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,960
Thank you!

2842
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:33,460
Oh!

2843
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,140
Pushed me away?

2844
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,780
Oh, I can't go here.

2845
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:38,920
Okay, so I have to go this way then.

2846
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:41,060
Oh!

2847
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:43,740
Item.

2848
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,800
We won.

2849
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:51,460
We run.

2850
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:54,200
Oh, more money!

2851
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,560
I like money.

2852
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:56,500
Yay!

2853
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,280
Oh, there's another bandit.

2854
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:03,740
Alright, if they won't let me...

2855
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,180
I wonder if they, like, let me get away.

2856
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:05,760
Oh, they do.

2857
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:06,440
Some of them do.

2858
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,900
That other bandit was, like, fucking freaky as hell.

2859
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,760
The other bandit won't let me go.

2860
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,300
You saw what I did to the first one.

2861
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,660
This one was, like...

2862
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:20,200
No, don't go.

2863
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,120
I wanna...

2864
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:23,920
I wanna be in the box, too.

2865
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,100
Alright.

2866
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,560
Yeah, that one bandit was a freak.

2867
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:36,620
I had to beat him up.

2868
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,960
I had to, like...

2869
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,320
I had to, like...

2870
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:40,840
Oh!

2871
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,840
Wait, that has to be a rare encounter.

2872
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:44,980
I've never seen him before.

2873
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,100
I haven't seen him other than on a trainer.

2874
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,260
Alright, Dragon.

2875
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:50,280
You know what to do.

2876
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,260
Star bag!

2877
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:57,120
You'll be fine, right?

2878
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,020
You'll be fine, right?

2879
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,600
Oh, you're fine.

2880
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,480
This time.

2881
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:00,580
Lick.

2882
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,180
Lick.

2883
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,300
Yes!

2884
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:10,940
Yes!

2885
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:14,300
Lick the bag!

2886
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,020
He's not wearing socks, too!

2887
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:19,220
Alright.

2888
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,560
We'll use the ball cap.

2889
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:23,040
Oh!

2890
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:23,920
Oh, what?

2891
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:24,800
He's like...

2892
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,200
No!

2893
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,520
No!

2894
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,680
No!

2895
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,230
He got lead!

2896
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,350
That's so fucked!

2897
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:39,530
Marshall's thinking...

2898
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:40,570
He didn't pay!

2899
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:43,350
He didn't pay for the services!

2900
01:43:48,650 --> 01:43:49,690
We saw...

2901
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:51,750
We saw we were too freaky.

2902
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,550
He said, nah.

2903
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:55,670
What's going on here?

2904
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:56,430
Oh, you...

2905
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:57,090
No, wait, wait.

2906
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:57,590
Oh, wait.

2907
01:43:57,810 --> 01:43:58,790
I swear to God.

2908
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:00,210
I swear to God.

2909
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:01,550
Look, he...

2910
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:03,730
He enjoyed it!

2911
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,150
I swear to God!

2912
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:10,050
Absolutely.

2913
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:11,790
Thank you for the super chat.

2914
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:13,110
Thank you, thank you.

2915
01:44:13,110 --> 01:44:15,570
Nothing personal, kid.

2916
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:18,630
Officer!

2917
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,210
Please!

2918
01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:20,110
It wasn't me!

2919
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:28,530
Alright.

2920
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:29,570
Get him out of here.

2921
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:31,870
Even the half's judging.

2922
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:40,370
Ooh.

2923
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,270
What's this?

2924
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:42,950
I'm so sad!

2925
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:44,710
We didn't get to catch him!

2926
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,920
Officer, I swear to God.

2927
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,160
He liked it.

2928
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:57,280
He's the one that scammed me!

2929
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:03,640
I gave him two free licks and then he ran away.

2930
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:08,180
Licked for free and left.

2931
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:10,760
Lego, thank you for the super chat.

2932
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:11,920
Thank you, thank you.

2933
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:14,000
He scammed you guys!

2934
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,220
Dragoons!

2935
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:17,120
You were the ones that did it!

2936
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:17,140
What?

2937
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,440
I was just...

2938
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,820
I was just making it.

2939
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:20,700
You guys do it.

2940
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:27,060
Alright.

2941
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,400
Get out of here, Ironcliff.

2942
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:33,440
Okay.

2943
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,120
Wow charge.

2944
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,060
Boom!

2945
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:43,510
Okay.

2946
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,490
Oh, that was a lot of XP!

2947
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:46,590
Yay!

2948
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:48,130
Agility.

2949
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:49,450
You don't need to be fast.

2950
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:50,390
Hahaha!

2951
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:53,530
No.

2952
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:54,930
Yes.

2953
01:45:55,630 --> 01:45:57,030
Oh wait, I keep pressing action press.

2954
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:57,370
No.

2955
01:45:58,370 --> 01:45:58,890
Yes.

2956
01:45:59,950 --> 01:46:01,470
You don't need to be fast guys.

2957
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:08,630
I guess if you're here, then either the guard outside let you in, or you came from 4-2.

2958
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:09,610
Oh well.

2959
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:11,350
I lost fair and square.

2960
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:13,630
So here's your purple coins.

2961
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:18,330
Yeah.

2962
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:19,810
You're here to enjoy it.

2963
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:21,990
You don't need the speed for that.

2964
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:26,030
Here we go.

2965
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:26,590
This way.

2966
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:28,890
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

2967
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:29,730
Thank you, thank you.

2968
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:31,170
We don't need money.

2969
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:34,890
We do it for the love of the game, Toki.

2970
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:35,550
Alright.

2971
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:37,770
Does Marshall speak for all you dragoons?

2972
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:38,810
I just want to be sure.

2973
01:46:39,270 --> 01:46:39,850
Does he...

2974
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:42,210
Does he speak for all of you guys?

2975
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:43,810
Portobello.

2976
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:44,610
Wow there!

2977
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:45,910
We'll let you in!

2978
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:50,430
Thank you for the super chat.

2979
01:46:50,590 --> 01:46:51,570
Thank you, thank you.

2980
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:55,230
We saw his feet for free, so that's even.

2981
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:57,910
No, no, no, no.

2982
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:03,010
Alright, nice.

2983
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,700
Oh, they sniff it!

2984
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,180
Alright, time to throw him.

2985
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,000
Get outta here!

2986
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,340
That's right!

2987
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:20,540
Yay!

2988
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,400
Oh no, they're catching up to dad.

2989
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,600
We can't let that happen.

2990
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:30,830
Nice.

2991
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,810
100 coins.

2992
01:47:33,010 --> 01:47:34,070
Oh, another nugget!

2993
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:37,630
We're gonna sell these nuggets to buy more caps.

2994
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:40,570
Nice.

2995
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:41,270
Star piece.

2996
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:47,950
Christopher!

2997
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,150
Thank you for the super chat.

2998
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:50,990
Thank you, thank you.

2999
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:51,790
Hi, Toki.

3000
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:52,930
First time super...

3001
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:54,230
Oh my god, he's a shy guy!

3002
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:55,550
First time super chatted.

3003
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:58,450
Please know I adore your Carmen-coded voice!

3004
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,930
Wait, do I actually sound like Carmen?

3005
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:02,610
Oh my god.

3006
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:06,830
Alright, it's time.

3007
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,070
Lick.

3008
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:10,390
No!

3009
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:16,150
No!

3010
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:21,630
Why won't you let me lick?

3011
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:22,810
Hahahaha!

3012
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:26,390
Alright.

3013
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:29,930
He hates it.

3014
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:32,570
I can't believe it!

3015
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,010
Yami, thank you for the super chat.

3016
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:35,790
Thank you, thank you.

3017
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:37,570
I can't believe it!

3018
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:39,830
He's normal.

3019
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:41,910
He's immune.

3020
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:43,370
No!

3021
01:48:44,570 --> 01:48:45,950
What's the point?

3022
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:47,890
What's the point?

3023
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:49,410
Oh, I only have two caps.

3024
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,270
Oh, I only have two caps!

3025
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:53,970
I don't have anybody that's fucking weak!

3026
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:56,110
Lick was my weakest move!

3027
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:59,350
It was actually my weakest move!

3028
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:00,790
Okay.

3029
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:04,090
There has to be one that's weaker.

3030
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:07,370
Oh no, I put it all in Lick.

3031
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:09,570
I put it all in Lick.

3032
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:10,690
Oh!

3033
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:14,630
I feel like I'm just gonna slap him if I use...

3034
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:16,130
No, he can't!

3035
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:19,130
The last time I used headbutt!

3036
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:21,130
He fucked...

3037
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:21,850
Oh wait, let's see.

3038
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:25,730
Alright.

3039
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:28,870
Maybe bite.

3040
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,710
Let me check, let me double check.

3041
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:34,690
No scheme!

3042
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:37,630
No, it's 60.

3043
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,690
Okay, I'll send out...

3044
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:41,510
I swear to God, if...

3045
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:43,840
If you kill him, I swear to God, I'm sending you...

3046
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:47,830
Smug goon, if you kill him, I'm sending you into the goon cave.

3047
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:48,650
I'm

3048
01:49:57,890 --> 01:50:06,930
sending you into the goon cave!

3049
01:50:08,690 --> 01:50:12,090
Into the goon cave, you go!

3050
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:19,370
Alright!

3051
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:22,790
Any innocents, please!

3052
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:30,850
It's stick bug time into the goon cave.

3053
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:33,950
You did nothing wrong.

3054
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:36,970
I had one simple instruction.

3055
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,610
One simple instruction.

3056
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:49,970
He was just... I told you to use a fine whip.

3057
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:51,670
It's too late.

3058
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:53,130
It's too late.

3059
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:56,730
It's time to goon in that cave.

3060
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:07,070
Oh my god, there's like two mons that I want to catch in here.

3061
01:51:07,630 --> 01:51:08,190
Oh, there he is!

3062
01:51:08,330 --> 01:51:08,850
One of them!

3063
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:10,050
Okay, nice.

3064
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:13,150
Nice, okay.

3065
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:16,970
Okay, we still have a chance.

3066
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:21,330
Tree, thank you for the super chat.

3067
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:21,670
Thank you.

3068
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:22,490
Thank you.

3069
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:25,110
Back for more.

3070
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:26,910
Time.

3071
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:30,510
That's right.

3072
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:32,230
I'm back.

3073
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:36,050
That's right.

3074
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:38,310
I'm back.

3075
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:40,250
Alright.

3076
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,810
Got you this time.

3077
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:47,390
Yay!

3078
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:50,510
That's right.

3079
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:51,510
You gotta pay for this.

3080
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:53,150
Yay!

3081
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:58,250
Sick bug grew to level 12.

3082
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,030
Struggle bug.

3083
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,210
What are you struggling?

3084
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:03,750
You don't have to pay rent.

3085
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:07,470
Alright, scary face.

3086
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:10,610
I was like...

3087
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:11,930
How are you struggling?

3088
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:18,940
A walking bag of star bits that's easily startled.

3089
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:22,580
It has the ability to learn turn invisible when frightened.

3090
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:25,960
I still know how many of them exist in the world.

3091
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,260
Alright, who wants to be a star bug?

3092
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,460
Or star bag?

3093
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:33,080
He has to pay rent by fighting for his...

3094
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:33,200
Yeah!

3095
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,040
I have to pay for it!

3096
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,100
Pebble, thank you for the super chat.

3097
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:37,540
Thank you.

3098
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,280
Thank you.

3099
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:39,820
Alright, Absol.

3100
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:42,560
I'll give it to you.

3101
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:44,880
Absol...

3102
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,440
Oh, wait.

3103
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:49,460
Absol...

3104
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:50,420
Coon.

3105
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:51,680
There we go.

3106
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:55,620
You're the freak.

3107
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:57,680
Wait.

3108
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,020
You should be...

3109
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:01,300
Also, your Yoshi impression was so cute.

3110
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:01,940
Baby Kwan!

3111
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,940
Thank you for the super chat!

3112
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:03,340
Ah!

3113
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,780
You were just a little too late.

3114
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:05,360
Don't worry.

3115
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:06,760
I got the next one for you.

3116
01:53:07,660 --> 01:53:08,020
Okay.

3117
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:09,860
Gotta go here.

3118
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:11,440
Okay.

3119
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,080
Obviously, he's watching.

3120
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,900
So, he should be, like, in the center.

3121
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:16,880
And then, like...

3122
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:19,180
Um...

3123
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:19,840
We'll put...

3124
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,320
Whisp Goon over here.

3125
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,200
So, like, he's at the top.

3126
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,320
And then...

3127
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,020
Smogoon.

3128
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:26,620
You're gonna...

3129
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:26,820
You...

3130
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,560
You get assigned to...

3131
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,880
Naso Goon.

3132
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:31,060
And then...

3133
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:32,700
And then...

3134
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:33,400
Vav Goon.

3135
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:34,660
You get assigned the hand.

3136
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:37,620
And then...

3137
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,300
Here we go.

3138
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,080
There we go.

3139
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:41,240
There...

3140
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:41,560
Oh, wait.

3141
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,040
Obviously, it's here.

3142
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:43,980
There we go.

3143
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:45,740
So, here are all your assignments.

3144
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,800
Ha ha ha ha.

3145
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:49,380
Ha ha ha ha.

3146
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:50,920
Ha ha ha ha.

3147
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:51,220
Ha ha ha ha.

3148
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:52,300
Ha ha ha ha.

3149
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:52,340
Ha ha ha.

3150
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:53,000
So, he isn't...

3151
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,480
Goon...

3152
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,440
All right.

3153
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:01,000
So, Smog, you get not-so...

3154
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:02,240
Goon.

3155
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,040
Yeah...

3156
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:04,860
Um...

3157
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:05,780
Wait a minute!

3158
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:08,320
Not-so Joker...

3159
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:08,980
You have...

3160
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:09,440
Oh, wait.

3161
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:09,960
That's fine.

3162
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:12,560
The Joker Goon is, we're like...

3163
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,960
More than just one...

3164
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:14,620
One...

3165
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:33,300
It wasn't... Okay, um, we have Abso with Wisp Goon, Aifen with Pro Goon, um, Fav Goon with Eons Goon, and then our Watchers, Matt... Okay, you get this corner, and then Dick Goon, you get the other corner.

3166
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:34,400
There we go.

3167
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,120
The perfect Goon game.

3168
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:37,360
There we go.

3169
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:40,940
Um, Abso, thank you for the super chat.

3170
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,040
Thank you, thank you.

3171
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,140
Don't keep casually writing.

3172
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:48,940
All right.

3173
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,100
It's perfect.

3174
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,300
Okay, we just need Shy Guy.

3175
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,180
We literally just need Shy Guy.

3176
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:57,000
And then we should be good to go.

3177
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,080
Champion, thank you for the super chat.

3178
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,440
Thank you, thank you.

3179
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:08,040
Oh my god, stop giving me bandits!

3180
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,360
I can't... This is all your fault, Smug.

3181
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:15,100
This is... This is... This is your fault.

3182
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:18,300
You used Gust.

3183
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,800
That's why you're vanished into the cave.

3184
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:29,410
You know what you did!

3185
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:31,350
You used Gust!

3186
01:55:32,950 --> 01:55:35,590
You used Gust and killed him!

3187
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:39,730
It's okay, one cap to get it done.

3188
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:41,050
We got this.

3189
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:42,870
I believe in the one cap run.

3190
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:47,470
It's so true and so real.

3191
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:48,450
Please!

3192
01:55:48,890 --> 01:55:50,250
I want the Shy Guy!

3193
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:52,270
Oh!

3194
01:55:52,450 --> 01:55:54,890
He was the rare encounter!

3195
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:56,510
You could have missed!

3196
01:55:59,930 --> 01:56:01,710
Oh no, I went the wrong way.

3197
01:56:01,890 --> 01:56:02,110
Whoops.

3198
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:03,270
Huh?

3199
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:05,070
I didn't get into clearing cave!

3200
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:06,170
No way!

3201
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:06,730
No way!

3202
01:56:06,730 --> 01:56:07,930
You brave for it too?

3203
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:08,570
Ha!

3204
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:12,170
This ruins my entire plan to make some quick cash!

3205
01:56:13,670 --> 01:56:14,130
Okay.

3206
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,170
Are you... No, this was the cave...

3207
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:19,170
This was the way I saw Shy Guy.

3208
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:19,870
Right here.

3209
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:27,640
Let me have...

3210
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:29,240
Let me have my Shy Guy!

3211
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,260
I want Shy Guy!

3212
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:32,840
He was so cute!

3213
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:37,240
Oh my god, I can't believe...

3214
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,460
Guys, can you encounter him in any other areas?

3215
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:40,920
Or is this the only area?

3216
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,170
That's right.

3217
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:50,890
I deleted his small business.

3218
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:52,650
I'm here to franchise.

3219
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:54,510
He's just a Shy Guy.

3220
01:56:57,710 --> 01:57:00,910
No, I have one cap to get the job done.

3221
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:10,470
He's also in Peach's Castle.

3222
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:12,910
Okay, I didn't see him in Peach's Castle.

3223
01:57:12,910 --> 01:57:13,990
So he is a rare encounter.

3224
01:57:14,170 --> 01:57:15,030
God damn it!

3225
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,950
He's a rare encounter!

3226
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:18,970
That fuck, he sucks.

3227
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:20,910
Okay.

3228
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:24,810
I swear...

3229
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:25,870
Okay, I'm gonna do it...

3230
01:57:25,870 --> 01:57:28,690
If I don't see him in the next five turns...

3231
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:32,490
If I don't see him in the next five encounters...

3232
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:33,550
I'm...

3233
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:34,550
I'm giving up.

3234
01:57:39,190 --> 01:57:40,010
Alright, four.

3235
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:51,190
There's an uncapped frame rate button on my...

3236
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:51,830
Wait, really?

3237
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:53,730
No, we don't need that.

3238
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:56,790
Alright, three.

3239
01:57:58,510 --> 01:57:59,790
I lost count.

3240
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:00,510
Wait, two?

3241
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:05,190
How did I lose count already?

3242
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:06,650
I lost count.

3243
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,490
Okay.

3244
01:58:07,850 --> 01:58:08,170
One.

3245
01:58:08,950 --> 01:58:09,990
Okay, one more.

3246
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:12,730
He's very shy.

3247
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:14,390
Why are you shy?

3248
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:16,890
It's still three, guys.

3249
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:17,890
It's still three.

3250
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,390
Oh my...

3251
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:22,270
Okay, it's over.

3252
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:23,690
Goodbye, Shy Guy.

3253
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:26,130
I guess I'll never see you.

3254
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:27,790
Unless...

3255
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:28,670
I'll do one more Hail Mary.

3256
01:58:29,450 --> 01:58:30,190
I'll do one more.

3257
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:31,230
I'll reset it here.

3258
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:33,010
I'll do one more.

3259
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:34,470
2.5.

3260
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:35,970
2.4.

3261
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:37,490
2.3.

3262
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:44,250
God damn it.

3263
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:47,270
I don't think I encountered Shy Guy in the Peach's Castle.

3264
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:48,090
In the garden.

3265
01:58:48,990 --> 01:58:50,730
I had trouble encountering him.

3266
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:56,130
What has Main Street become?

3267
01:58:56,130 --> 01:58:59,610
This cave used to be free for anyone to enter.

3268
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:07,610
But ever since Waluigi showed up and bought all the land, they've been greedily trying to tunnel through to the other side.

3269
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:14,410
All I want is to go back to the days where I could explore this cave freely.

3270
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:18,130
How dare you say that about our boy Waluigi?

3271
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:20,370
I can't believe it.

3272
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:22,010
How dare he?

3273
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:23,810
Waluigi would never!

3274
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:26,110
This bush has been activated.

3275
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:30,990
I've been acting very strange ever since my friend from Sarasaland gifted it to me.

3276
01:59:31,650 --> 01:59:35,050
Every time I trim it, it seems to grow back immediately.

3277
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:36,630
Can you give me a look?

3278
01:59:37,190 --> 01:59:37,610
Okay.

3279
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:41,690
The wild Pokey leaped out to attack?

3280
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:42,650
What's this?

3281
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:44,650
Hmm.

3282
01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:47,150
Oh shit.

3283
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:49,450
Okay.

3284
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:51,310
Oh, this is for my one ball.

3285
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:52,410
Alright, Pokey.

3286
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:55,370
Alright.

3287
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:56,210
This is it.

3288
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:58,130
It's time.

3289
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:01,350
Wait.

3290
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:02,170
You might die.

3291
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:03,670
But it's time.

3292
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:08,210
It's always time.

3293
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:14,490
Lick the cactus.

3294
02:00:14,690 --> 02:00:15,430
Wait.

3295
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:16,250
Toki.

3296
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:16,570
No.

3297
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:17,170
Oh.

3298
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:18,450
Your final breath.

3299
02:00:19,290 --> 02:00:21,410
The last thing you do.

3300
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:26,610
This is...

3301
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:29,170
He died doing what he loves.

3302
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,570
Changed the world.

3303
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:35,510
He died doing what he loves.

3304
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:36,050
Guys.

3305
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,670
Lick the crow says, thank you for the super chat.

3306
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:41,070
Thank you.

3307
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:41,930
Thank you.

3308
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:45,750
Guy gets shy around cute girls.

3309
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:49,710
Finally, we are free.

3310
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:52,090
Soren, thank you for the super chat.

3311
02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:52,490
Thank you.

3312
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:53,110
Thank you.

3313
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:55,430
Alright, how much damage does this do?

3314
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:56,950
Jesus Christ.

3315
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:03,640
I wonder if like...

3316
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:05,940
Uh...

3317
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:06,840
It is raining.

3318
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,340
Alright, how much does bug bite do?

3319
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,060
Oh, nice.

3320
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:13,880
Okay, just enough.

3321
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:14,340
Guys.

3322
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:14,740
Alright.

3323
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:17,700
Got one ball to catch him.

3324
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:18,620
Wait.

3325
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,620
Actually, to guarantee it, let me just...

3326
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:21,780
Okay.

3327
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:22,740
Goodbye, stick bug.

3328
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,800
Goodbye, stick bug.

3329
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:28,480
To catch one guy, he has killed like...

3330
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:29,900
Two of my mons.

3331
02:01:33,810 --> 02:01:34,370
Okay.

3332
02:01:34,950 --> 02:01:36,530
Oh, it doesn't affect him.

3333
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:37,570
Okay, that's fine.

3334
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:40,770
Alright.

3335
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:43,910
This is it.

3336
02:01:45,030 --> 02:01:46,190
It's time to party.

3337
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,020
Pokey was caught!

3338
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,400
Oh, that koala wanted to beat you.

3339
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:03,880
Alright, nice.

3340
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:07,220
A walking cactus.

3341
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:09,520
Its body segments are not vital organs.

3342
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:11,180
It sheds them every two years.

3343
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:15,420
It has a wobbly demeanor and uses a silly face to lure in young prey.

3344
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:16,280
Alright.

3345
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:18,780
Let's see.

3346
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:20,140
Koala...

3347
02:02:20,460 --> 02:02:20,920
Goon.

3348
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,080
Koala...

3349
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:29,400
Goon.

3350
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:33,080
There we go.

3351
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:38,410
That's kinda dark.

3352
02:02:39,070 --> 02:02:41,050
I mean, well, don't fucking lick cactuses.

3353
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:46,350
Alright.

3354
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:50,110
Into the exile box you go.

3355
02:02:50,670 --> 02:02:51,410
I should...

3356
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:53,730
I should have known a poke was hiding in there.

3357
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,750
Well, thanks anyway.

3358
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:57,410
For taking care of it.

3359
02:02:57,830 --> 02:02:59,910
Now my bush can be trimmed properly.

3360
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:02,030
Yeah, I did it.

3361
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:03,910
I'm such a good person.

3362
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:05,950
Okay, there's the defense bean.

3363
02:03:07,110 --> 02:03:08,390
Hello, are you okay, sir?

3364
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:16,870
I hear the reason Waluigi even bought this part of Main Street was because the cave had some serious money making potential.

3365
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:23,210
Although, I don't think Waluigi even cares too much about the money in the first place.

3366
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:29,710
All he wants to do is expand his operation and become the ultimate gamer.

3367
02:03:30,050 --> 02:03:31,650
Whatever that means.

3368
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:32,470
What?

3369
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:33,190
Of course...

3370
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:33,570
What?

3371
02:03:34,150 --> 02:03:36,890
Waluigi, you want to be the ultimate gamer?

3372
02:03:37,690 --> 02:03:38,630
Let's go.

3373
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:40,810
That's my Oshii.

3374
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:46,970
Even Waluigi with all his money was at trouble developing the land past this point.

3375
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:49,610
Be careful you're planning on hating out there.

3376
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:51,890
My hero, Waluigi.

3377
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:52,890
Wah!

3378
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:57,730
My Oshii right there.

3379
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,890
Wanting to be an ultimate gamer, I can relate.

3380
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:05,550
Alright, let's restore him.

3381
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:09,890
Yeah, don't you dare disrespect my homie like that.

3382
02:04:10,450 --> 02:04:11,170
Not so, Joker.

3383
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:12,230
Thank you for the super chat.

3384
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:13,230
Thank you, thank you.

3385
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:17,590
I gotta get out of this kingdom soon.

3386
02:04:17,850 --> 02:04:19,290
There's weirdos everywhere.

3387
02:04:20,250 --> 02:04:23,750
I heard that 90% of gamblers strike big before they quit...

3388
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:24,990
Shut the fuck up, Shy Guy.

3389
02:04:25,210 --> 02:04:25,910
Shut the fuck up.

3390
02:04:25,950 --> 02:04:26,550
I tried.

3391
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:28,330
I tried to catch him.

3392
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:30,390
How did he know?

3393
02:04:31,650 --> 02:04:32,490
I tried!

3394
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:39,310
There's a lot of bad people around Main Street.

3395
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:40,730
Keep yourself safe.

3396
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:41,230
Whoa!

3397
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:42,990
Toad.

3398
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:46,990
Whoa!

3399
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:51,830
Damn, that's fucked up, Toad.

3400
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:52,630
Whoa!

3401
02:04:56,530 --> 02:04:57,410
Bro!

3402
02:04:58,250 --> 02:05:01,050
I didn't know there was worse influence than Bowser.

3403
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:02,830
Waluigi.

3404
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:05,810
Gamer Toad!

3405
02:05:06,770 --> 02:05:07,170
Whoa!

3406
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:08,630
Toad!

3407
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:09,610
That's fucked!

3408
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:14,450
Keep yourself safe now.

3409
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:18,910
Main Street used to be a small little village in the marshes.

3410
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:23,170
Then, Waluigi came and built that foreign casino.

3411
02:05:23,470 --> 02:05:27,370
Now all people can think about gambling away their coins.

3412
02:05:28,190 --> 02:05:30,170
Wait, I don't wanna win purple coins.

3413
02:05:34,150 --> 02:05:36,570
Purple coins are so shining and sparkly and purple!

3414
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:41,110
Everyone's so keen on the new purple coins.

3415
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:43,910
I'm not really too crazy about them.

3416
02:05:44,150 --> 02:05:46,770
But they practically replaced our entire economy!

3417
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:49,730
Wait, so they're like the British pound.

3418
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:51,070
Versus euros.

3419
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:57,430
What am I going to do?

3420
02:05:57,890 --> 02:05:58,750
Oh, sorry!

3421
02:05:58,990 --> 02:06:00,210
I didn't notice you!

3422
02:06:00,610 --> 02:06:02,690
I'm just worried about my son!

3423
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:04,850
I haven't been able to focus, lady!

3424
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:09,170
You see, he went east to work on clear and claim a while back.

3425
02:06:09,390 --> 02:06:11,950
And fell into these nightmares shortly after!

3426
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:14,770
He hasn't woken up since!

3427
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:16,250
And I've been worried sick!

3428
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:17,110
Please!

3429
02:06:17,290 --> 02:06:18,430
You have to do something!

3430
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:20,290
What the fuck do I do?

3431
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:24,370
It's the only clue I have about what happened!

3432
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:25,350
What's done?

3433
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:26,010
No!

3434
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:26,670
Please!

3435
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:28,630
The fuck do I do?

3436
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:32,090
Get a doctor!

3437
02:06:32,630 --> 02:06:33,990
I'm just Italian!

3438
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:35,790
Like...

3439
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:38,710
Why won't she just get a doctor?

3440
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:54,030
Waluigi told us to go earn our keep at the Casino Red and pay us up front!

3441
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:56,070
What kind of solutions is that?

3442
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:59,050
Just send us a gamble for the work we did!

3443
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:05,100
Main Street, I've really been booming lately!

3444
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:06,780
Okay, there's too many toads.

3445
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:07,720
I'm... a cat.

3446
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:11,760
Thanks to Waluigi bring over purple coins!

3447
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:17,040
Although it is a bit weird having a different currency from the rest of the world!

3448
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:18,400
There's too many toads!

3449
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:30,680
I hope Waluigi ends up paying us what we're owed for the working glittering cave.

3450
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:32,660
We need our purple coins!

3451
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:37,200
I'm gonna give my toad voice a little rest, or it was just too many.

3452
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:41,460
It's like 90% of this population is just fucking toads.

3453
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:42,800
Oh, hello there!

3454
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:44,600
Are you looking for the casino?

3455
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:48,680
I'm sorry to say, but that's not in this building.

3456
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:54,520
You gotta head on down to the far end of Main Street if you wanna find it.

3457
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:55,260
Okay.

3458
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:03,100
I only recently moved to Main Street after I heard about the brand new casino!

3459
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:06,500
I'm gonna strike it out and get rich quick!

3460
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:10,320
As soon as I take out a small loan from the guy on this floor.

3461
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:11,700
That is...

3462
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:13,080
Oh, it's a loan shark!

3463
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,020
You here to see the boss?

3464
02:08:19,260 --> 02:08:21,820
Be on your best behavior, you hear me, pal?

3465
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:27,600
You better not get on the boss's bad end side.

3466
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:30,040
Otherwise, we'll have to come after you.

3467
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,360
And I mean it.

3468
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:33,660
You need some purple?

3469
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:35,940
Talk to the boss, then.

3470
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:37,800
And don't be disrespectful.

3471
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:38,980
What the fuck?

3472
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:40,000
Some purple?

3473
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:41,380
Holy shit!

3474
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:42,400
This is so...

3475
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:43,580
This sounds illegal.

3476
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:50,110
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

3477
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:50,930
Thank you, thank you.

3478
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:54,090
Puberty Hit Boy Stone's voice like a truck.

3479
02:08:54,390 --> 02:08:55,750
He's some purple kid.

3480
02:08:57,210 --> 02:08:57,910
What's that?

3481
02:08:58,270 --> 02:09:01,330
You're here to get some purple coins?

3482
02:09:02,030 --> 02:09:03,750
Well, you're in luck, friend.

3483
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:06,690
I'm willing to loan you some.

3484
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:10,830
No need to fill out an application or anything.

3485
02:09:11,630 --> 02:09:11,930
Heh!

3486
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:13,910
So what do you say?

3487
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,610
Trust me?

3488
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:17,790
He seems like a nice old man, guys.

3489
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:19,970
Smart choice, friend.

3490
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:22,010
Got five!

3491
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:23,410
Oh my god!

3492
02:09:23,670 --> 02:09:24,650
I'm rich!

3493
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:28,790
A thousand!

3494
02:09:29,070 --> 02:09:30,190
Oh, I'm going to the casino.

3495
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:32,570
I'm ready.

3496
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:34,870
I'm gonna go to the casino.

3497
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:36,750
I'm gonna make it big!

3498
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:39,210
This is it!

3499
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:40,970
Don't tell anyone.

3500
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:43,770
The building right behind has an infamous...

3501
02:09:43,770 --> 02:09:45,310
Oh my god, why didn't he tell me sooner?

3502
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:46,270
No, Shrike.

3503
02:09:46,590 --> 02:09:51,790
I heard Bowser borrowed some purple coins from him the other day, only to find himself frizzled and dead.

3504
02:09:52,130 --> 02:09:53,010
I will stay clear.

3505
02:09:53,190 --> 02:09:54,810
Why did you tell me now?

3506
02:09:55,410 --> 02:09:57,890
I just borrowed purple coins!

3507
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:03,500
Why did he tell me this now?

3508
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:12,640
Pulo's like, these are all that are left of what Main Street was before.

3509
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:15,040
While Luigi set up his casino.

3510
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,700
This used to be a place of nature.

3511
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:20,620
But I suppose this is good for business.

3512
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:21,340
No!

3513
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:26,300
Why did he not say this sooner?

3514
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,640
Oh my god, I can spend it all...

3515
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:33,380
on hats!

3516
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:39,040
Guys!

3517
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,720
I can spend it all...

3518
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,300
I can buy 99...

3519
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:46,400
I'm gonna buy 99 baseball caps!

3520
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:48,620
I'm gonna do it!

3521
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:51,800
I'm gonna buy 99 baseball caps!

3522
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:52,840
Let's go!

3523
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,400
Are you sure?

3524
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:54,640
Are you sure?

3525
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:54,840
And you...

3526
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:56,960
Faith, and you wanted 99?

3527
02:10:57,640 --> 02:10:59,500
Are you sure?

3528
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:04,280
Yes!

3529
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,220
I'm rich!

3530
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:09,240
I have 99 hats!

3531
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:09,920
Guys!

3532
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,280
Guys!

3533
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:17,600
I'm rich!

3534
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:30,880
I just lost all my purple coins in the casino.

3535
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:33,420
Now I gotta live in the mar with my pro.

3536
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:34,500
Guys!

3537
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:37,240
I made a great financial decision!

3538
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,620
I have so many hats!

3539
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:45,420
It's basically free money, guys!

3540
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:46,840
Absolutely!

3541
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:47,980
Thank you for the super chat!

3542
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:48,380
Thank you!

3543
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:48,900
Thank you!

3544
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:52,700
Toki's inner team fortress 2 player unleashed!

3545
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:55,520
The new main street is great!

3546
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:59,020
Thanks to Waluigi's casino, I can afford anything I want!

3547
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:02,060
Sure, I may have gotten just a bit lucky!

3548
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:07,300
I found a nice man who loaned me a whopping 5,000 purple coins!

3549
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:11,920
Instead of gambling win, I used the funds to rent out a nice flat!

3550
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:13,920
Uh...

3551
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:18,460
Where I can live out the rest of my days in peace!

3552
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:19,840
What's this?

3553
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:21,700
Whoa!

3554
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:25,740
Sorry, I got...

3555
02:12:25,740 --> 02:12:28,820
I got, like, a voicemail because I ignored a call.

3556
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:31,400
HAHAHAHAHAHA!

3557
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:32,580
HAHAHAHA!

3558
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:33,720
HAHAHAHA!

3559
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:33,780
HAHAHAHA!

3560
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:35,220
And so I was like, what's this?

3561
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,240
Is it an important call?

3562
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:39,940
HAHAHAHA!

3563
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:40,900
HAHAHAHA!

3564
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:41,860
Oh well!

3565
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:43,700
HAHAHAHA!

3566
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:47,640
Alright!

3567
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,520
It's the lone shark!

3568
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,080
Oh no!

3569
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:52,740
It's the lone shark!

3570
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:53,920
Huh?

3571
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:56,080
Don't bother me!

3572
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:58,000
I'm busy playing Super Mario Bros.

3573
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:59,180
3 Gacha Edition!

3574
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:00,900
You used purple gold?

3575
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:01,520
No!

3576
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:03,200
Gacha Edition!

3577
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,700
Oh no!

3578
02:13:06,620 --> 02:13:07,900
Not the...

3579
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:10,280
Not the transactions!

3580
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:12,320
Not pay to win!

3581
02:13:14,980 --> 02:13:15,620
Hmm...

3582
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:18,260
Only had some viruses to test these pills out on.

3583
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:22,200
But the prices at the casino are much too steep for me.

3584
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:22,560
No!

3585
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:24,860
Not the microtransactions!

3586
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:27,340
I live with maniacs.

3587
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:29,780
One of them is addicted to pills.

3588
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:31,680
And the other gacha games...

3589
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:35,100
Our purple coins aren't going to last long at this rate.

3590
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:36,520
Oh hey!

3591
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:37,660
What is he doing here?

3592
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:40,120
What?

3593
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:43,280
Ever seen a Magikoopa besides comic before?

3594
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:45,280
We exist, I assure you.

3595
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:48,700
Not everyone is a die-hard fan of Lord Bowser.

3596
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:50,300
Though...

3597
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:53,340
I probably shouldn't be talking to you now that I think about it.

3598
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:57,040
We're supposed to be starting a minion support group here.

3599
02:13:57,260 --> 02:14:01,740
But doesn't seem like many of Lord Bowser's minions are even aware of us.

3600
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:02,480
Oh my god!

3601
02:14:02,620 --> 02:14:04,180
A minion support group!

3602
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,160
Luke, thank you for the super chat!

3603
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:07,060
Thank you, thank you!

3604
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:11,900
Now I see how she spent 200k in one year.

3605
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:14,360
It's 99 hats!

3606
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:18,480
Guys, I swear I can pay him back.

3607
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:18,980
You know what?

3608
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,160
I feel so confident.

3609
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,160
I'm gonna save too.

3610
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:26,320
I'm gonna save after purchasing 99 hats.

3611
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:26,460
What for this?

3612
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:31,920
Honey there.

3613
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:34,160
Want some max nut?

3614
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:37,300
I'll cut you a deal for a doorway.

3615
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:39,860
You know what?

3616
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:41,720
Let's grab one max nut.

3617
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,880
Here's your max nut...

3618
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:45,200
Now straight from the source?

3619
02:14:49,610 --> 02:14:50,340
Hello, police?

3620
02:14:52,860 --> 02:14:54,460
Okay, wait.

3621
02:14:54,860 --> 02:14:55,960
Wait a minute.

3622
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:57,540
What is a max nut?

3623
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,140
Oh, okay, okay.

3624
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:01,400
It restores HP.

3625
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:02,800
Okay, it's a peanut, guys.

3626
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,940
Guys, it's not... It's a peanut, guys.

3627
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:06,640
It's a peanut.

3628
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:09,440
But, like, where did he get it from?

3629
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,620
Like... Oh, no, he can't talk.

3630
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:18,500
Are you okay?

3631
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:20,400
Did you get a concussion?

3632
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,260
Do you need a doctor?

3633
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:24,420
Don't worry, I'm Dr. Mario.

3634
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:27,240
Oh, no, this Koomba can't talk.

3635
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:28,520
Koomba, are you okay?

3636
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:36,760
Oh, my God, you finally hatched!

3637
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:39,080
It's been 80 years.

3638
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:43,400
Whose child was this again?

3639
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,020
Whose child was this?

3640
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:48,720
I forgot who the parents were.

3641
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,340
That was how long ago it was.

3642
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:52,320
John and Mehdi?

3643
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,780
All right, what do you want to name your kid?

3644
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,600
Who was the mother?

3645
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:59,360
Who was...

3646
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:04,460
Who was the mother?

3647
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,120
All right, John's the ma or is it Mehdi?

3648
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,840
All right, what do you guys want to name your child?

3649
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:14,060
Jedi.

3650
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:16,940
Jedi, good.

3651
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,860
Mehdi, don't be ashamed.

3652
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:20,660
I know you guys are here.

3653
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:23,060
Don't be ashamed right now.

3654
02:16:25,540 --> 02:16:28,040
This child is not mine.

3655
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:31,100
I demand a DNA test.

3656
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,780
John, thank you for the super chat.

3657
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:35,140
Thank you, thank you.

3658
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:37,680
All right, all right.

3659
02:16:37,940 --> 02:16:38,820
Jedi, goon.

3660
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:42,280
Okay, John, you are not the father.

3661
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,180
I don't know.

3662
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:45,260
There were only two of you there.

3663
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:48,320
All right, Jedi, goon.

3664
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,560
Jedi, goon.

3665
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:55,260
There you go.

3666
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:56,420
You're right.

3667
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:00,060
You're not the father because you're the mother.

3668
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:01,360
Congratulations.

3669
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:03,100
It's a boy.

3670
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:05,960
It's a boy.

3671
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:14,040
All right, now we can put the baby in the chamber.

3672
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,600
All right, you have to be in the exile chamber, though.

3673
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:22,340
All right, and then I want to...

3674
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:23,800
No, it's too late, Mehdi.

3675
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:24,500
It's too late.

3676
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:28,840
It's too late.

3677
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:30,760
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat.

3678
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,200
Thank you.

3679
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:31,960
Thank you.

3680
02:17:33,060 --> 02:17:33,420
Absolute.

3681
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:34,380
Thank you for the super chat.

3682
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:34,740
Thank you.

3683
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,160
Thank you.

3684
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:37,600
John, you are the father.

3685
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:42,240
Oh, yeah, I want to bring the ghost in.

3686
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:45,020
Okay, I want to rearrange my team.

3687
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:47,100
Okay, this one is...

3688
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:50,000
Steel, fly, and then grass, dark.

3689
02:17:50,480 --> 02:17:52,320
Normal, steel, fly, grass, dark.

3690
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:53,620
Bug, water.

3691
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,420
And then we have ghost.

3692
02:17:56,540 --> 02:17:59,620
Okay, steel, fly, grass, water, fighting.

3693
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,700
I don't know, actually.

3694
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:03,840
I actually think my team is fine so far.

3695
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:04,380
You know what?

3696
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:05,440
Yeah, we'll keep this team.

3697
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,380
I like this team.

3698
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:08,880
Awesome.

3699
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:13,520
Yeah, I like this team so far.

3700
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:18,240
I hate this PC so much.

3701
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:21,880
I was loading that super chat for a full minute.

3702
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:24,880
We were too late, Mehdi.

3703
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:26,120
Thank you for the super chat.

3704
02:18:26,220 --> 02:18:27,000
Thank you, thank you.

3705
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:27,900
What's that?

3706
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,100
You're new to the casino?

3707
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:30,380
Here, take this.

3708
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:33,580
Don't expect this sort of kindness from the other patrons, though.

3709
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,020
Feel like they have to battle them if you want any purple coins.

3710
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,980
Good luck out there, my mustachioed friend.

3711
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,880
Wait, let's go gambling.

3712
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,640
Oh my god, it's just like the Pokemon version.

3713
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:46,900
Okay.

3714
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:47,360
Okay.

3715
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:52,020
Oh my god, this is a lot harder.

3716
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:57,040
Oh my god, wait, I can do this.

3717
02:18:59,120 --> 02:18:59,440
Okay.

3718
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:04,110
Yay!

3719
02:19:07,450 --> 02:19:08,190
Okay, nice.

3720
02:19:08,370 --> 02:19:09,150
Okay, I figured it out.

3721
02:19:13,050 --> 02:19:13,530
Fuck.

3722
02:19:14,330 --> 02:19:14,810
Okay.

3723
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:15,610
Okay, that's fine.

3724
02:19:18,790 --> 02:19:19,270
No!

3725
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:25,050
Oh, nice.

3726
02:19:25,230 --> 02:19:25,810
Okay, we got two.

3727
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:29,030
Okay, we got some of our money back.

3728
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:33,370
Okay, this is really hard.

3729
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:34,810
I should quit the game.

3730
02:19:36,010 --> 02:19:38,170
Seems you're too distracted to notice you.

3731
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:41,870
Well, I can't stop winning.

3732
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:44,050
Oh, shit.

3733
02:19:45,510 --> 02:19:46,750
Let's go gambling!

3734
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:47,910
Let's go gambling!

3735
02:19:49,530 --> 02:19:50,810
Aw, dang it!

3736
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:53,670
Wait, he can't stop winning.

3737
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:56,550
So like, maybe I'll be lucky too.

3738
02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:58,870
And press...

3739
02:19:58,870 --> 02:19:59,210
Okay.

3740
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:02,410
And then we go...

3741
02:20:02,410 --> 02:20:03,410
Green Yoshi.

3742
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:10,700
Are you fucking kidding me?

3743
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,220
I said green Yoshi!

3744
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:14,140
I'll keep playing.

3745
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:14,920
Green Yoshi.

3746
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:17,460
It'll eventually hit green Yoshi.

3747
02:20:20,220 --> 02:20:21,760
Oh my god, we are so close.

3748
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:23,060
Okay, that's fine.

3749
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:23,500
That's fine.

3750
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:25,400
Okay.

3751
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:26,520
Green Yoshi.

3752
02:20:31,990 --> 02:20:32,690
No!

3753
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,770
You...

3754
02:20:35,450 --> 02:20:36,230
Okay.

3755
02:20:37,230 --> 02:20:37,830
Okay.

3756
02:20:38,350 --> 02:20:39,110
Purple Yoshi.

3757
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:42,570
All the purples!

3758
02:20:43,170 --> 02:20:44,790
Are you fucking kidding me?

3759
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:46,750
Are you kidding me?

3760
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:50,790
Purple Yoshi.

3761
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:55,500
No.

3762
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:56,000
No.

3763
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,020
Oh my god.

3764
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:57,420
Okay.

3765
02:20:57,900 --> 02:20:58,620
I have one more.

3766
02:21:00,460 --> 02:21:01,540
Green Yoshi.

3767
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:07,080
I swear to god.

3768
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:07,980
I swear to god.

3769
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:08,880
Are you...

3770
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:09,820
Oh my...

3771
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:11,040
Okay, I need to use the bathroom.

3772
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:12,040
I...

3773
02:22:11,770 --> 02:22:12,490
It's fine.

3774
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:13,210
It's fine.

3775
02:22:13,650 --> 02:22:16,990
Alan, Medi, Zekra, Bike, Ghost, Solid.

3776
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:18,130
Thank you for the super chat.

3777
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:18,510
Thank you.

3778
02:22:18,650 --> 02:22:19,130
Thank you.

3779
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:19,590
It's okay.

3780
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:20,710
It's okay.

3781
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:21,490
It's okay.

3782
02:22:21,810 --> 02:22:22,450
It's fine.

3783
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:23,970
All right.

3784
02:22:24,630 --> 02:22:25,190
Green Yoshi.

3785
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:28,110
Eventually, I'll hit green Yoshi.

3786
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:28,670
I believe.

3787
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,910
I believe.

3788
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:32,070
Okay.

3789
02:22:32,170 --> 02:22:32,710
Yellow Yoshi.

3790
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:33,670
Okay, that's fine.

3791
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:35,530
Getting rid of...

3792
02:22:35,530 --> 02:22:35,910
Wrong color.

3793
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:37,270
Green Yoshi.

3794
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:43,840
That's okay.

3795
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,640
That's okay.

3796
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:47,820
Green Yoshi.

3797
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:52,240
It'll hit.

3798
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:53,500
Guys, trust me.

3799
02:22:53,660 --> 02:22:54,680
It will hit.

3800
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,020
Oh my fucking god.

3801
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:56,580
Don't worry.

3802
02:22:57,460 --> 02:22:58,440
Green Yoshi.

3803
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:02,880
No.

3804
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:08,400
I made it all back.

3805
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:09,860
I made everything back.

3806
02:23:10,480 --> 02:23:11,720
I told you.

3807
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:13,700
Eventually, it'll hit.

3808
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:15,120
Oh, it was just 12.

3809
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:15,520
Okay.

3810
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:17,760
Okay.

3811
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,620
We stopped there.

3812
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:22,320
We might have to stop there.

3813
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:23,400
I don't...

3814
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:25,220
Hey, have you checked out the prizes?

3815
02:23:25,580 --> 02:23:27,540
They're even offering up some party members.

3816
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:29,320
Doesn't feel very legal.

3817
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:31,160
Oh, I can exchange.

3818
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:32,240
Okay, there's the...

3819
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:33,700
Oh, I already have that though.

3820
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:34,840
That's the...

3821
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:40,360
Little Sparky.

3822
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:41,860
Mecha Koopas.

3823
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:43,160
Virus.

3824
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,060
Oh!

3825
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:45,580
Oh my god.

3826
02:23:45,580 --> 02:23:46,800
I should have...

3827
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:48,060
Okay, we're gonna...

3828
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:51,920
It's $1,000 for 50 coins.

3829
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:54,800
Wait, 500 coins for $10,000.

3830
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:56,960
Oh, I can exchange stuff.

3831
02:23:58,460 --> 02:23:59,260
Is that it?

3832
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:02,420
That's like a cold drink after a win at some slots.

3833
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,200
Okay, where does this go?

3834
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:05,580
Oh.

3835
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:06,800
Oh, is this a puzzle?

3836
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:10,280
Mario Minecraft.

3837
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:13,220
Can you please come here for a moment?

3838
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:15,680
This is your first visit a casino, correct?

3839
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,260
Do you have a coin case?

3840
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:19,480
Oh, you already have a coin case.

3841
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:22,440
Now then, allow me to explain the rules of casino.

3842
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:28,480
Waluigi, who runs this casino, believes in the philosophy of a rich gets richer.

3843
02:24:28,900 --> 02:24:30,900
This means in order to progress further...

3844
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:32,220
Oh my god, he's just like...

3845
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,360
He's just like us, guys.

3846
02:24:36,340 --> 02:24:40,640
To the machine with better odds, you need to already have quite a few purple coins.

3847
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:47,100
Purple coins can obtain through any means necessary throughout both Main Street and this casino.

3848
02:24:47,260 --> 02:24:50,200
You're not just restricted to gambling in the slots in here.

3849
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:58,200
Use your intuition to figure out the best way to acquire purple coins and make your final room with Waluigi.

3850
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:02,760
Only those capabilities are worth his power stars.

3851
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,200
Alright.

3852
02:25:03,720 --> 02:25:05,260
Oh, it's this puzzle.

3853
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:07,260
Wee!

3854
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:08,320
Oh, hello.

3855
02:25:09,460 --> 02:25:10,980
I'm gonna hit it big.

3856
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:12,500
Just you wait and see.

3857
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:14,980
Hmm.

3858
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:16,020
Thank you for the super chat.

3859
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:16,340
Thank you.

3860
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:16,840
Thank you.

3861
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:18,400
So all of these are like...

3862
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:21,320
So the further I go, the more...

3863
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:22,960
I need to make sure I don't use that.

3864
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:24,640
The better the odds are.

3865
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:27,700
Alright.

3866
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:27,920
Alright.

3867
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,000
Oh, that's super effective.

3868
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:32,680
Okay.

3869
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:33,620
It's not very effective.

3870
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:33,920
Okay.

3871
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:34,500
Flame wheel.

3872
02:25:35,480 --> 02:25:36,200
Oh, shit.

3873
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:36,760
Oh, no.

3874
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:37,460
He started clapping.

3875
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:41,560
That's all I can do now.

3876
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,040
I got too happy.

3877
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:47,920
I want to meet my Oshi.

3878
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:48,860
Wah!

3879
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:49,940
Luigi.

3880
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:53,600
Yay!

3881
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:54,520
Stick bug.

3882
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:55,920
You go, stick bug.

3883
02:25:58,540 --> 02:26:00,060
Marsha, thank you for the super chat.

3884
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:00,460
Thank you.

3885
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:01,200
Thank you.

3886
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:04,720
If any means necessary, I guess we'll have to do some more.

3887
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:07,000
Oh, my God.

3888
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:08,340
The stick bug can bite?

3889
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:10,460
Okay.

3890
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:12,940
60, 50.

3891
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:14,600
40, uh...

3892
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:15,720
We'll get rid of the quick attack.

3893
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:18,080
Casual, thank you for the super chat.

3894
02:26:18,220 --> 02:26:18,460
Thank you.

3895
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,180
Thank you.

3896
02:26:19,580 --> 02:26:22,960
Well, speaking of Elder Ring, isn't that tomorrow?

3897
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:28,240
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

3898
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:28,580
Thank you.

3899
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:29,300
Thank you.

3900
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:33,560
Explosion looking at Doki like the green goblin mask.

3901
02:26:34,820 --> 02:26:37,160
He's like, Pick me.

3902
02:26:37,580 --> 02:26:40,660
Who know you want to, Doki?

3903
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:43,080
I'm right here.

3904
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:44,620
I...

3905
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:48,220
I...

3906
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,600
Come on, Doki.

3907
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:53,380
Click me.

3908
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:56,940
Click me.

3909
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:00,180
Oh, I used to...

3910
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:00,480
Oh, wait.

3911
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:00,940
No, it's fine.

3912
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:03,620
I was still clapping.

3913
02:27:05,460 --> 02:27:07,020
Yeah, that was 16.

3914
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:13,600
Oh, my God.

3915
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:13,980
Dead!

3916
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:15,460
We're gonna evolve to.

3917
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,360
Oh, my God.

3918
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:17,660
We're gonna evolve into the bomb...

3919
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:18,420
The bomb king.

3920
02:27:20,060 --> 02:27:21,460
It only makes sense, right?

3921
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:22,580
Wait, is it?

3922
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:24,120
That's the king, right?

3923
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:25,700
Yes!

3924
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:35,310
He grew into the king, Ba-bam!

3925
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:37,750
Oh, my God.

3926
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:39,210
He's so dapper now.

3927
02:27:40,130 --> 02:27:42,370
He's still firefighting.

3928
02:27:44,150 --> 02:27:46,810
Why are you firefighting?

3929
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:47,690
He's...

3930
02:27:47,690 --> 02:27:52,950
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...

3931
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:54,010
But, like...

3932
02:27:54,010 --> 02:27:55,230
What if I...

3933
02:27:55,230 --> 02:28:01,350
What if I have to use... Lord live the game.

3934
02:28:02,810 --> 02:28:03,250
Okay.

3935
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:04,070
Oh yeah, you're right.

3936
02:28:04,450 --> 02:28:05,090
It is better.

3937
02:28:05,390 --> 02:28:05,590
You're right.

3938
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:07,130
I should... No, we keep it.

3939
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:11,250
Alright.

3940
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:13,030
I learned fire punch.

3941
02:28:13,890 --> 02:28:16,050
He's gonna punch his problems away.

3942
02:28:16,470 --> 02:28:17,990
I was doing so well.

3943
02:28:18,650 --> 02:28:20,250
Rules are rules.

3944
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:21,390
What's this?

3945
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:24,450
Pay a hundred dollars?

3946
02:28:24,450 --> 02:28:25,610
It's a coin.

3947
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:27,650
I'm not gonna fucking pay a hundred dollars.

3948
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:28,510
What the fuck?

3949
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:32,110
Okay, but like, is this easier now?

3950
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:35,590
Okay, no it's not.

3951
02:28:37,910 --> 02:28:39,590
I'm not gonna pay a hundred dollars.

3952
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:40,690
Fuck that shit.

3953
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:43,450
Where does it take me though?

3954
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:46,510
Okay, I should pay a hundred dollars.

3955
02:28:50,850 --> 02:28:51,250
Okay.

3956
02:28:51,850 --> 02:28:54,090
You guys, I might have to pay a hundred dollars.

3957
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:00,500
All right.

3958
02:29:00,780 --> 02:29:01,940
This should be the right one.

3959
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:02,240
Yeah.

3960
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:05,600
Oh, now I have better odds.

3961
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:09,780
Green Yoshi.

3962
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:16,050
Would the lone shark take my night?

3963
02:29:16,370 --> 02:29:18,650
They said I have better odds!

3964
02:29:21,150 --> 02:29:22,650
They lied to me!

3965
02:29:22,650 --> 02:29:22,730
They lied to me!

3966
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:26,210
Whoa!

3967
02:29:30,130 --> 02:29:30,830
Mario!

3968
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:32,650
How'd you get here so fast?

3969
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:35,090
I just destroyed that warp pipe.

3970
02:29:35,270 --> 02:29:38,090
I mean, those toads work fast on repairs, huh?

3971
02:29:38,490 --> 02:29:39,550
Never mind that.

3972
02:29:40,570 --> 02:29:41,150
Gamec!

3973
02:29:41,250 --> 02:29:43,170
I need you for Mario!

3974
02:29:43,490 --> 02:29:44,530
Buck kicking time!

3975
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:46,590
Be right there!

3976
02:29:46,750 --> 02:29:47,810
You're gambling this!

3977
02:29:49,890 --> 02:29:50,930
You know what?

3978
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:52,410
Take your time.

3979
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:53,770
Maya!

3980
02:29:54,330 --> 02:29:56,830
Back-to-back butt-kicking time!

3981
02:29:59,010 --> 02:30:01,810
You think he'll loan me 5,000 purple coins?

3982
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:08,490
You think he'll loan me that money?

3983
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:15,050
If I take a loan from him, then I can use it to pay back my other loan.

3984
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:17,670
And then I'll take another loan from someone else.

3985
02:30:17,810 --> 02:30:20,730
So I can take back that, so that I can pay this loan.

3986
02:30:20,910 --> 02:30:23,390
And then I'll just have to keep taking loans.

3987
02:30:23,570 --> 02:30:24,390
And then it'll be fine.

3988
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:29,800
Okay, he grew level 17.

3989
02:30:30,340 --> 02:30:30,660
Nice.

3990
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:33,060
The infinite money glitch.

3991
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:38,380
Alright, he's gonna send his, like, subject in.

3992
02:30:42,130 --> 02:30:42,650
Fine.

3993
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:43,890
That's...

3994
02:30:43,890 --> 02:30:45,110
It's not fine.

3995
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:46,850
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3996
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:48,910
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3997
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:51,330
Oh, shit.

3998
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:53,990
I never even thought I had to get this...

3999
02:30:53,990 --> 02:30:55,470
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4000
02:30:58,130 --> 02:30:58,530
Guys.

4001
02:30:59,250 --> 02:30:59,770
Guys.

4002
02:31:00,070 --> 02:31:02,930
Wait, what do you mean it wasn't fine in the end?

4003
02:31:03,270 --> 02:31:05,570
It was no longer fine.

4004
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:11,740
The king!

4005
02:31:11,940 --> 02:31:12,520
Law live!

4006
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:13,300
The king!

4007
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:15,320
Wait, do I have...

4008
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,900
Oh, nice.

4009
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:21,680
I knew it.

4010
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:22,240
Nice.

4011
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:23,040
Okay, he's back.

4012
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:24,860
Don't worry.

4013
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,620
Dad's back.

4014
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:27,620
Can't keep him down.

4015
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:31,880
What the fuck?

4016
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:33,820
How do you still have critical hit?

4017
02:31:40,260 --> 02:31:41,860
Is this all you know?

4018
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:47,560
Alright, nice.

4019
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:48,060
He's down.

4020
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:55,880
Okay, nice.

4021
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:57,980
Now 31.

4022
02:31:58,560 --> 02:31:59,940
Stick bug with a level 18.

4023
02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:04,950
Oh, he learns this...

4024
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:05,990
No, we don't need that.

4025
02:32:08,330 --> 02:32:09,710
Okay, Mecha Koopa.

4026
02:32:10,370 --> 02:32:11,390
Okay, it's time.

4027
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:13,350
It's time for you to throw a robot.

4028
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:19,480
Oh!

4029
02:32:20,260 --> 02:32:21,480
I love those things.

4030
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:22,260
They're so cute.

4031
02:32:25,630 --> 02:32:26,710
Get out of here.

4032
02:32:27,610 --> 02:32:28,450
That's right.

4033
02:32:28,750 --> 02:32:30,590
You can't keep the king down.

4034
02:32:31,810 --> 02:32:32,890
You're so goofy.

4035
02:32:32,890 --> 02:32:33,490
I know.

4036
02:32:34,450 --> 02:32:35,390
Shadow sneak?

4037
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:36,630
What is that?

4038
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:40,030
Then use your shadow to strike first.

4039
02:32:40,530 --> 02:32:41,210
Oh, nah.

4040
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:43,550
We don't need that.

4041
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:45,550
That's a weak- Weak-ass move.

4042
02:32:46,390 --> 02:32:46,730
Alright.

4043
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:49,550
That's okay.

4044
02:32:51,910 --> 02:32:53,190
We have this.

4045
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:06,120
We don't need quick attack, guys.

4046
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:08,780
We don't need it.

4047
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:14,540
Okay, nice.

4048
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,580
Oh, he doesn't do critical hit on him.

4049
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:19,300
I just noticed that.

4050
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:23,920
There can only be one king.

4051
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:31,000
It doesn't matter.

4052
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:32,400
I just need one hit.

4053
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:35,320
Yay!

4054
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:44,190
Oh.

4055
02:33:44,650 --> 02:33:47,250
My other two little guys are gaining so fast.

4056
02:33:47,710 --> 02:33:48,250
Kamik!

4057
02:33:48,410 --> 02:33:49,730
Your strategy didn't work!

4058
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:53,290
Stickbug is evolving!

4059
02:33:53,950 --> 02:33:55,270
What does he evolve to?

4060
02:33:55,490 --> 02:33:56,150
I don't remember.

4061
02:33:59,770 --> 02:34:00,510
Oh my god.

4062
02:34:00,630 --> 02:34:01,270
The fuck is he...

4063
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:01,710
What's that?

4064
02:34:04,010 --> 02:34:05,150
What is that?

4065
02:34:07,490 --> 02:34:09,670
What the fuck is that?

4066
02:34:11,930 --> 02:34:14,070
Oh, it's a scuttlebug!

4067
02:34:16,030 --> 02:34:17,350
Oh my god.

4068
02:34:17,850 --> 02:34:19,350
The purple looks so weird.

4069
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:22,290
Okay, vacuum wave.

4070
02:34:23,010 --> 02:34:24,410
Wait, is he fighting?

4071
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:26,330
I swear to god.

4072
02:34:29,170 --> 02:34:31,490
I swear to fucking god.

4073
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:32,470
Nah.

4074
02:34:32,790 --> 02:34:33,330
I mean...

4075
02:34:33,330 --> 02:34:33,610
Hahaha.

4076
02:34:38,950 --> 02:34:40,550
He stole Bug water?

4077
02:34:40,750 --> 02:34:40,910
Oh.

4078
02:34:41,250 --> 02:34:41,570
Hahaha.

4079
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:45,070
I was like...

4080
02:34:45,070 --> 02:34:46,490
I swear to fucking god.

4081
02:34:46,690 --> 02:34:47,230
Are you...

4082
02:34:48,670 --> 02:34:49,230
Alright.

4083
02:34:49,530 --> 02:34:50,450
No, we don't need that.

4084
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:52,050
Oh!

4085
02:34:52,210 --> 02:34:52,810
Double kick!

4086
02:34:53,010 --> 02:34:54,590
Wait, he has like so many...

4087
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:55,910
We don't need that.

4088
02:35:01,830 --> 02:35:03,470
Why do I keep losing?

4089
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:06,110
Take your stupid purple coins Mario.

4090
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:08,290
Do you have like 4,800 more?

4091
02:35:08,550 --> 02:35:12,770
I sort of need a little bit more.

4092
02:35:13,170 --> 02:35:14,830
No, no, we don't need priority moves.

4093
02:35:15,010 --> 02:35:16,530
We just need Ungabunga.

4094
02:35:19,790 --> 02:35:23,330
You and I are going to have a serious talk about these strategies.

4095
02:35:23,330 --> 02:35:28,630
Now, is it this tile or... No, it's okay, guys.

4096
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:30,010
We just need Ungabunga.

4097
02:35:30,670 --> 02:35:31,470
That's it.

4098
02:35:33,850 --> 02:35:34,770
Where are the other?

4099
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:37,410
Okay.

4100
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:39,170
I believe.

4101
02:35:43,730 --> 02:35:44,710
Okay, never mind.

4102
02:35:44,710 --> 02:35:45,470
I don't believe.

4103
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:50,010
We Unga until we Bunga.

4104
02:35:50,170 --> 02:35:50,530
Oh, hey!

4105
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:54,550
Oh, this battling for purple coins has really tied me out.

4106
02:35:54,990 --> 02:35:57,150
I'm glad at least I don't have to use the slots.

4107
02:35:57,430 --> 02:36:00,850
Wait, you guys said I can like... Uh...

4108
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:02,310
Use some of your purple coins on this.

4109
02:36:02,470 --> 02:36:03,810
It'll heal your potty right up.

4110
02:36:03,870 --> 02:36:06,550
You said you got... We can like change how we throw the ball?

4111
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:12,100
Okay.

4112
02:36:17,310 --> 02:36:18,870
How do we change it?

4113
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:20,490
All green, by the way.

4114
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:23,890
Oh, my God.

4115
02:36:23,990 --> 02:36:24,910
I fucking knew it.

4116
02:36:27,310 --> 02:36:28,570
Oh, I hit it.

4117
02:36:28,890 --> 02:36:29,350
Nice.

4118
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:31,790
Oh, it has a pattern.

4119
02:36:32,310 --> 02:36:32,430
Oh!

4120
02:36:34,590 --> 02:36:35,350
Alright, guys.

4121
02:36:35,410 --> 02:36:36,010
How do we cheat?

4122
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:39,950
Hey!

4123
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:41,190
I was in a...

4124
02:36:47,650 --> 02:36:48,870
Oh, no.

4125
02:36:50,250 --> 02:36:51,230
She's addicted.

4126
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:54,150
My three whole coins.

4127
02:36:54,810 --> 02:36:56,830
Okay, Fire Punch might be good against this.

4128
02:37:02,050 --> 02:37:05,750
Also, it's funny that you guys think that I'm ever gonna send Sick Bug out.

4129
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:12,770
You guys are like, No!

4130
02:37:13,510 --> 02:37:13,870
Stop!

4131
02:37:14,010 --> 02:37:14,770
You need priority!

4132
02:37:15,070 --> 02:37:17,750
As if like, he's ever gonna come out and actually fight.

4133
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:22,310
He's like more...

4134
02:37:22,310 --> 02:37:23,050
Oh, shit!

4135
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:25,390
High critical.

4136
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:26,330
Wait, I can...

4137
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:27,630
That's better than Storm Throw.

4138
02:37:28,730 --> 02:37:30,490
Oh, but it's only five moves.

4139
02:37:31,790 --> 02:37:33,510
Okay, I need to stop hurting myself.

4140
02:37:33,650 --> 02:37:34,810
I'm gonna get rid of Wild Charge.

4141
02:37:35,090 --> 02:37:36,150
I feel like...

4142
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:37,990
Me hurting myself is like...

4143
02:37:39,630 --> 02:37:41,070
We gotta stop that.

4144
02:37:47,530 --> 02:37:48,270
Oh, no.

4145
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:56,870
Yeah, my team is just him.

4146
02:37:57,190 --> 02:37:57,990
Oh, I don't have any.

4147
02:37:58,290 --> 02:37:58,710
You know what?

4148
02:37:58,810 --> 02:37:59,230
Let's try.

4149
02:38:00,770 --> 02:38:01,950
Let's get him out of here.

4150
02:38:02,790 --> 02:38:03,510
Wait, what?

4151
02:38:03,510 --> 02:38:04,110
Oh, yeah.

4152
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,750
You can't fucking beat up the grass, apparently.

4153
02:38:07,290 --> 02:38:07,530
Yeah.

4154
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:10,670
Why can't I punch grass?

4155
02:38:11,650 --> 02:38:12,250
Champion.

4156
02:38:12,470 --> 02:38:13,430
Thank you for the super chat.

4157
02:38:13,570 --> 02:38:13,810
Thank you.

4158
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:14,510
Thank you.

4159
02:38:24,450 --> 02:38:25,170
All right.

4160
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:25,510
Nice.

4161
02:38:26,610 --> 02:38:27,210
No.

4162
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:29,050
It's dad's time.

4163
02:38:29,430 --> 02:38:31,450
It's always dad's time.

4164
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:36,250
I should really get rid of Explosion.

4165
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:38,170
I'm like now limited to moves.

4166
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,460
It's like it's such a cool...

4167
02:38:45,460 --> 02:38:46,080
It's like...

4168
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:48,720
It's just looking at me like that.

4169
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:50,340
No.

4170
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:53,360
My hot cheek is ruined.

4171
02:38:55,740 --> 02:38:56,540
All right.

4172
02:38:56,700 --> 02:38:56,900
Nice.

4173
02:38:58,540 --> 02:39:00,320
Oh, this guy wants to fight.

4174
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:02,540
Oh, nice.

4175
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:03,300
I knew it.

4176
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:06,720
I knew there were things in there.

4177
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:09,320
Fight me.

4178
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:10,020
Heh.

4179
02:39:10,460 --> 02:39:13,720
It seems like a good target to nab some purple coins from.

4180
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:14,560
Oh, yeah?

4181
02:39:14,860 --> 02:39:15,620
I got dad.

4182
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:18,080
That's fucking right.

4183
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:19,180
Holy shit.

4184
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:20,500
I forgot about this guy.

4185
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:26,930
That's right.

4186
02:39:27,850 --> 02:39:29,090
Get out of here.

4187
02:39:30,010 --> 02:39:31,130
What are you gonna do?

4188
02:39:31,870 --> 02:39:33,770
I have a king right here.

4189
02:39:38,330 --> 02:39:38,730
Okay.

4190
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:40,850
See ya.

4191
02:39:41,450 --> 02:39:41,970
What's up, this?

4192
02:39:42,690 --> 02:39:43,310
Oh, fake out.

4193
02:39:44,130 --> 02:39:45,290
Is that gonna do nothing?

4194
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:46,150
Jesus.

4195
02:39:46,350 --> 02:39:47,770
All of them have like critical hits.

4196
02:39:51,170 --> 02:39:51,610
No!

4197
02:39:51,730 --> 02:39:52,210
My item!

4198
02:39:52,690 --> 02:39:53,290
My item!

4199
02:39:57,210 --> 02:39:59,450
It's like he stole it or something.

4200
02:39:59,810 --> 02:40:00,910
It's like he's a thief.

4201
02:40:04,470 --> 02:40:06,810
Does it automatically go back in my pocket?

4202
02:40:09,830 --> 02:40:11,270
Oh my god.

4203
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:14,730
It's like some sort of fucking thief.

4204
02:40:17,910 --> 02:40:18,550
No!

4205
02:40:19,290 --> 02:40:19,790
No!

4206
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:20,370
I'm not again.

4207
02:40:24,190 --> 02:40:25,370
Oh, he can't use that.

4208
02:40:25,530 --> 02:40:25,970
Oh, yeah.

4209
02:40:26,610 --> 02:40:28,530
I don't even remember what that item was.

4210
02:40:29,310 --> 02:40:30,590
I don't know what I gave him.

4211
02:40:30,690 --> 02:40:31,570
That was so long ago.

4212
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:38,350
What kind of bandit would just steal from me?

4213
02:40:41,050 --> 02:40:43,710
No, we don't need to explode yet, guys.

4214
02:40:44,230 --> 02:40:44,910
We don't...

4215
02:40:44,910 --> 02:40:47,110
It's time to explode, Doki.

4216
02:40:47,330 --> 02:40:48,130
It's right there.

4217
02:40:58,050 --> 02:40:59,830
Oh, it was a sap bump.

4218
02:41:00,050 --> 02:41:00,310
Okay.

4219
02:41:01,770 --> 02:41:04,330
Okay, we can actually like give him a different item.

4220
02:41:05,050 --> 02:41:05,250
Ha!

4221
02:41:05,570 --> 02:41:07,830
Take that purple coin and get out of here!

4222
02:41:08,510 --> 02:41:08,950
Nice.

4223
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:09,410
Okay.

4224
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:11,930
Let's heal dad real quick.

4225
02:41:14,650 --> 02:41:15,790
No, randomly.

4226
02:41:16,130 --> 02:41:17,310
Will it heal dad ran...

4227
02:41:17,310 --> 02:41:18,050
Oh, it...

4228
02:41:18,050 --> 02:41:19,250
It was...

4229
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:20,590
Who would have thought...

4230
02:41:20,590 --> 02:41:24,270
When he said heal randomly, it was actually heal randomly.

4231
02:41:25,210 --> 02:41:27,170
I don't know what I...

4232
02:41:27,170 --> 02:41:29,390
Well, I don't know what I was thinking, guys.

4233
02:41:29,710 --> 02:41:30,210
I...

4234
02:41:30,210 --> 02:41:33,570
For some reason, I thought something different will happen.

4235
02:41:35,250 --> 02:41:37,590
That gold finger...

4236
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:40,170
We can't believe in our heals.

4237
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:44,270
Alright, let's see.

4238
02:41:45,410 --> 02:41:46,110
Upon...

4239
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:48,570
That restores HP upon striking the foe.

4240
02:41:48,810 --> 02:41:49,310
Oh, wait.

4241
02:41:49,910 --> 02:41:51,210
Is there a better one?

4242
02:41:54,510 --> 02:41:56,530
All Koopa Troopas...

4243
02:41:56,530 --> 02:41:57,270
It's so light...

4244
02:41:57,270 --> 02:41:58,090
It has...

4245
02:41:58,090 --> 02:41:58,830
It captures...

4246
02:41:58,830 --> 02:42:01,110
A plain mushroom that will sell...

4247
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:01,870
Uh...

4248
02:42:01,870 --> 02:42:03,770
May latch onto foes.

4249
02:42:04,690 --> 02:42:06,350
Graduate stores HP...

4250
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:07,490
Big nugget...

4251
02:42:07,490 --> 02:42:09,770
Red gem stored...

4252
02:42:09,770 --> 02:42:11,170
Raises the base...

4253
02:42:11,170 --> 02:42:13,350
Doubles money in battle if the holder takes...

4254
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:13,830
Oh, wait!

4255
02:42:15,970 --> 02:42:17,450
I might as well do this.

4256
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:18,770
No, he doesn't need it.

4257
02:42:19,670 --> 02:42:20,330
Money.

4258
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:21,550
We like money.

4259
02:42:21,950 --> 02:42:22,710
Wait, we don't...

4260
02:42:22,710 --> 02:42:24,150
Wait, does it include purple coins?

4261
02:42:24,710 --> 02:42:26,110
Okay, we'll do shell belt.

4262
02:42:26,370 --> 02:42:27,610
Because we don't need money anymore.

4263
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:28,430
We use...

4264
02:42:28,430 --> 02:42:29,790
We have 99...

4265
02:42:30,450 --> 02:42:30,890
Caps.

4266
02:42:31,170 --> 02:42:31,610
Hats.

4267
02:42:34,190 --> 02:42:35,610
Oh, I should give...

4268
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:36,850
What was the evil like, dude?

4269
02:42:36,890 --> 02:42:37,570
I don't even remember.

4270
02:42:38,890 --> 02:42:39,310
Oh!

4271
02:42:40,110 --> 02:42:41,370
Nah, we don't care.

4272
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:42,530
Oh, wait.

4273
02:42:42,570 --> 02:42:43,570
I bought this max nut.

4274
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:44,550
I might as well use it.

4275
02:42:45,090 --> 02:42:46,750
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4276
02:42:48,470 --> 02:42:49,870
Ha ha ha ha ha!

4277
02:42:49,870 --> 02:42:51,450
I might...

4278
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:53,670
Take this max nut that...

4279
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:55,870
That Ramli bought from a stranger.

4280
02:42:56,570 --> 02:42:57,670
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4281
02:42:58,130 --> 02:42:58,310
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4282
02:42:58,310 --> 02:42:58,470
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4283
02:43:01,390 --> 02:43:03,470
I bought that from a stranger, guys.

4284
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:09,260
Okay.

4285
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:12,100
Hey!

4286
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:14,500
Do you know what star types Waluigi uses?

4287
02:43:18,030 --> 02:43:19,910
Yes, the stranger's max nut.

4288
02:43:22,270 --> 02:43:22,830
Oh!

4289
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:27,210
Poison P. All right.

4290
02:43:27,290 --> 02:43:27,950
Use fire punch.

4291
02:43:28,050 --> 02:43:28,550
Punch him!

4292
02:43:30,570 --> 02:43:31,990
Punch that cactus!

4293
02:43:33,170 --> 02:43:33,870
All right.

4294
02:43:34,970 --> 02:43:35,710
It's okay.

4295
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:36,230
Nice.

4296
02:43:36,350 --> 02:43:37,070
We heal a little bit.

4297
02:43:39,130 --> 02:43:39,690
Nice.

4298
02:43:39,870 --> 02:43:40,830
My little 10 HP.

4299
02:43:44,490 --> 02:43:45,910
Keep punching him!

4300
02:43:46,290 --> 02:43:46,450
All right.

4301
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:46,710
Oops.

4302
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:47,350
Okay.

4303
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:48,390
Maybe not now.

4304
02:43:51,510 --> 02:43:52,090
It's okay.

4305
02:43:52,270 --> 02:43:53,870
Now we keep punching him!

4306
02:43:57,690 --> 02:43:58,130
Nice.

4307
02:44:06,070 --> 02:44:06,510
Yay!

4308
02:44:09,930 --> 02:44:10,370
Slash?

4309
02:44:10,550 --> 02:44:11,250
Oh, air slash.

4310
02:44:11,430 --> 02:44:11,530
Wait.

4311
02:44:11,630 --> 02:44:12,450
That's a good move, right?

4312
02:44:12,450 --> 02:44:13,090
75.

4313
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:15,170
Magnet bomb.

4314
02:44:15,550 --> 02:44:16,110
Rock throw.

4315
02:44:16,530 --> 02:44:16,730
Ooh.

4316
02:44:16,990 --> 02:44:17,170
Okay.

4317
02:44:17,210 --> 02:44:18,310
Let's get rid of headbutt.

4318
02:44:18,630 --> 02:44:20,090
We don't need a normal move.

4319
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:21,770
We have Dragoon for that.

4320
02:44:24,730 --> 02:44:26,070
Get out of here.

4321
02:44:28,530 --> 02:44:31,390
What level does Dragoon evolve on?

4322
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:32,670
Guys?

4323
02:44:33,030 --> 02:44:33,690
Do you guys remember?

4324
02:44:34,070 --> 02:44:34,870
Because I don't.

4325
02:44:35,730 --> 02:44:36,150
Oh!

4326
02:44:36,670 --> 02:44:37,050
Swoop!

4327
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:38,970
That's cute.

4328
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:42,710
50?

4329
02:44:42,990 --> 02:44:43,530
Oh my god.

4330
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:44,350
We're not close.

4331
02:44:44,890 --> 02:44:46,190
We're not close.

4332
02:44:48,930 --> 02:44:49,990
Punch him!

4333
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:51,490
Yeah!

4334
02:44:52,910 --> 02:44:54,250
Punch that bat!

4335
02:44:59,230 --> 02:45:00,050
All right.

4336
02:45:03,750 --> 02:45:05,490
No, you don't need to be fast.

4337
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:11,950
Use Telf Puff?

4338
02:45:12,290 --> 02:45:13,110
Don't worry.

4339
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:16,410
You can use any other Mario mod you want.

4340
02:45:17,190 --> 02:45:18,970
I know what I'm gonna do.

4341
02:45:19,270 --> 02:45:20,790
I just keep punching.

4342
02:45:23,370 --> 02:45:24,830
That's fucking right.

4343
02:45:26,370 --> 02:45:27,870
Just keep punching.

4344
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:32,750
Yay!

4345
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:38,810
That's right!

4346
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:39,690
The poison!

4347
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:40,270
Oh!

4348
02:45:40,650 --> 02:45:42,130
Waluigi uses poison!

4349
02:45:42,790 --> 02:45:43,110
Okay.

4350
02:45:43,470 --> 02:45:44,510
That's good to know.

4351
02:45:45,150 --> 02:45:46,550
It's not gonna do anything, though.

4352
02:45:46,550 --> 02:45:47,450
Okay, I should.

4353
02:45:49,130 --> 02:45:50,190
Yeah, fuck it.

4354
02:45:50,310 --> 02:45:50,710
That's fine.

4355
02:45:50,950 --> 02:45:52,150
I really need to heal Dad anyway.

4356
02:45:52,450 --> 02:45:55,050
I literally have, like, almost no more moves left.

4357
02:45:56,230 --> 02:45:57,350
Because he's purple!

4358
02:45:57,810 --> 02:45:58,550
He's herpa!

4359
02:46:00,910 --> 02:46:01,890
I'm not going.

4360
02:46:02,590 --> 02:46:03,410
Oh my god.

4361
02:46:03,410 --> 02:46:04,150
Are you serious?

4362
02:46:05,290 --> 02:46:05,810
Okay.

4363
02:46:05,950 --> 02:46:06,650
And then...

4364
02:46:06,650 --> 02:46:07,490
We go here.

4365
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,090
And then...

4366
02:46:10,650 --> 02:46:11,170
Oh...

4367
02:46:11,170 --> 02:46:11,730
Here.

4368
02:46:11,730 --> 02:46:13,350
And then...

4369
02:46:13,350 --> 02:46:15,210
I chose the bottom.

4370
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:16,510
So...

4371
02:46:16,510 --> 02:46:17,350
I...

4372
02:46:17,350 --> 02:46:18,690
I chose the same one again.

4373
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:19,430
I...

4374
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:24,170
It happened so fast!

4375
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:25,630
Okay.

4376
02:46:25,910 --> 02:46:27,970
And then I go the bottom.

4377
02:46:29,070 --> 02:46:29,470
Wait.

4378
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:30,430
What?

4379
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:33,990
Wait.

4380
02:46:34,590 --> 02:46:35,330
Wait, what?

4381
02:46:35,550 --> 02:46:36,830
I paid for it!

4382
02:46:37,830 --> 02:46:38,990
Wait, what?

4383
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:45,070
There's a different path up?

4384
02:46:46,610 --> 02:46:47,730
Better is it?

4385
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:52,070
Wait, what?

4386
02:46:52,750 --> 02:46:54,670
I have to pay for it again?

4387
02:46:58,150 --> 02:47:00,590
Oh, there's another switch to a five.

4388
02:47:00,890 --> 02:47:01,350
Do I have to pay?

4389
02:47:01,970 --> 02:47:02,950
Oh my

4390
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:07,380
god.

4391
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:08,720
I have to pay again?

4392
02:47:12,760 --> 02:47:14,400
She scanned me?

4393
02:47:22,530 --> 02:47:23,570
Wait, what?

4394
02:47:28,670 --> 02:47:30,070
I don't know.

4395
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:40,270
What?

4396
02:47:42,270 --> 02:47:44,610
I don't wish you wouldn't do that.

4397
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:46,350
Whoa!

4398
02:47:48,850 --> 02:47:51,210
Oh, it's this one!

4399
02:47:52,270 --> 02:47:54,290
Wait, how do I get to that one?

4400
02:48:01,140 --> 02:48:03,140
Wait, how do I get to there?

4401
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:08,200
Okay.

4402
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:11,100
No!

4403
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:11,220
No!

4404
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:14,400
Why did Luigi wouldn't scare me?

4405
02:48:15,320 --> 02:48:16,040
No!

4406
02:48:27,780 --> 02:48:30,360
Can't be a bad guy.

4407
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:31,820
Here?

4408
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:34,940
Oh, that just makes me go back.

4409
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:37,120
I'm so lost.

4410
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:38,920
I'm so lost.

4411
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:43,920
Why do Luigi would never...

4412
02:48:48,070 --> 02:48:49,810
Okay, we go here.

4413
02:48:52,770 --> 02:48:53,330
Is it here?

4414
02:48:54,070 --> 02:48:55,330
Oh, it's here!

4415
02:48:55,570 --> 02:48:56,450
I did, I told you.

4416
02:48:56,590 --> 02:48:58,870
Waluigi would... I was just stupid, guys.

4417
02:48:59,450 --> 02:49:01,910
Waluigi would never scam me.

4418
02:49:02,130 --> 02:49:04,170
I was just being silly.

4419
02:49:06,830 --> 02:49:07,210
Okay.

4420
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:09,790
Then it goes here.

4421
02:49:10,210 --> 02:49:12,330
Okay, so I don't go there.

4422
02:49:16,190 --> 02:49:17,730
Here, up.

4423
02:49:19,090 --> 02:49:20,890
Right, quick.

4424
02:49:22,770 --> 02:49:24,590
Where's the other monitor?

4425
02:49:26,550 --> 02:49:27,210
No!

4426
02:49:32,370 --> 02:49:33,430
Wait, what?

4427
02:49:35,350 --> 02:49:37,110
I pressed this monitor?

4428
02:49:46,850 --> 02:49:47,910
This monitor?

4429
02:49:53,320 --> 02:49:54,360
What changed?

4430
02:50:06,570 --> 02:50:07,310
Huh?

4431
02:50:12,390 --> 02:50:13,050
What?

4432
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:16,390
What happened?

4433
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:18,210
What?

4434
02:50:18,210 --> 02:50:18,290
What?

4435
02:50:27,250 --> 02:50:28,510
Oh, it...

4436
02:50:28,910 --> 02:50:29,370
No!

4437
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:33,870
I have to read!

4438
02:50:35,790 --> 02:50:37,690
Get game bugged.

4439
02:50:37,890 --> 02:50:38,170
No!

4440
02:50:43,230 --> 02:50:44,330
My money!

4441
02:50:51,400 --> 02:50:52,420
Did it work?

4442
02:50:54,420 --> 02:50:55,520
Did it...

4443
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,080
Gosh, it don't work.

4444
02:50:58,280 --> 02:50:59,640
It don't work!

4445
02:51:05,590 --> 02:51:06,230
It don't work!

4446
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:07,390
Oh, it worked!

4447
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:08,370
Yippee!

4448
02:51:08,970 --> 02:51:10,730
I knew it was me, guys.

4449
02:51:11,030 --> 02:51:12,590
It was my fault.

4450
02:51:12,930 --> 02:51:15,190
I knew Waluigi would never...

4451
02:51:16,610 --> 02:51:17,450
It's okay!

4452
02:51:17,650 --> 02:51:18,570
It was just me!

4453
02:51:18,950 --> 02:51:20,990
Maoshi would never do this to me!

4454
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:22,950
Hey, so...

4455
02:51:22,950 --> 02:51:23,610
Why Mario?

4456
02:51:24,090 --> 02:51:25,130
You've arrived!

4457
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:28,840
Tell me, Mario...

4458
02:51:29,190 --> 02:51:30,430
Are you...

4459
02:51:30,430 --> 02:51:31,010
A...

4460
02:51:31,010 --> 02:51:31,510
Gamer?

4461
02:51:31,970 --> 02:51:32,370
Wah!

4462
02:51:33,900 --> 02:51:36,270
I like to think my existence...

4463
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:37,770
My purpose...

4464
02:51:37,770 --> 02:51:39,270
Is to become...

4465
02:51:39,270 --> 02:51:40,550
The ultimate gamer!

4466
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:42,750
Golf!

4467
02:51:43,010 --> 02:51:43,690
Tennis!

4468
02:51:43,990 --> 02:51:44,630
Racing!

4469
02:51:45,070 --> 02:51:47,470
All are but a few examples...

4470
02:51:47,470 --> 02:51:49,650
About my gaming powers!

4471
02:51:50,190 --> 02:51:50,410
Wah!

4472
02:51:51,770 --> 02:51:52,530
Now...

4473
02:51:52,530 --> 02:51:54,770
A new game has been presented to me!

4474
02:51:55,070 --> 02:51:56,710
I must master it!

4475
02:51:57,330 --> 02:51:58,030
Mario!

4476
02:51:58,550 --> 02:52:00,370
You think you can defeat me?

4477
02:52:00,670 --> 02:52:02,570
The ultimate gamer?

4478
02:52:03,130 --> 02:52:04,510
Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

4479
02:52:05,430 --> 02:52:07,390
He-he-he-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

4480
02:52:08,110 --> 02:52:09,390
Oh my god!

4481
02:52:09,390 --> 02:52:11,170
I'm fighting my Oshi!

4482
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:15,770
The ultimate gamer!

4483
02:52:16,310 --> 02:52:17,610
You should give up now!

4484
02:52:18,050 --> 02:52:20,710
No use facing the ultimate gamer!

4485
02:52:21,290 --> 02:52:22,110
Oh my god!

4486
02:52:22,130 --> 02:52:22,890
He's so cool!

4487
02:52:23,810 --> 02:52:25,390
He's so fucking cool!

4488
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:32,300
He doesn't need a proper gaming set!

4489
02:52:32,420 --> 02:52:34,040
That's how good he is!

4490
02:52:34,540 --> 02:52:35,200
What the fuck?

4491
02:52:35,380 --> 02:52:35,900
Who came in?

4492
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:37,000
And what's that noise?

4493
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:38,700
Oh my god!

4494
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:39,220
Look!

4495
02:52:39,640 --> 02:52:41,780
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

4496
02:52:41,780 --> 02:52:45,530
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

4497
02:52:45,550 --> 02:52:47,150
He's beautiful!

4498
02:52:47,910 --> 02:52:49,070
I need him!

4499
02:52:49,330 --> 02:52:51,190
I need him!

4500
02:52:53,170 --> 02:52:56,390
I need him in my...

4501
02:52:57,010 --> 02:52:58,270
He's seen box.

4502
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:01,310
He needs to be in.

4503
02:53:01,650 --> 02:53:04,010
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

4504
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:07,330
He's beautiful...

4505
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:13,850
Okay, obviously, I have to swap off.

4506
02:53:14,090 --> 02:53:16,070
So I'll swap the husky.

4507
02:53:20,670 --> 02:53:22,250
What is he gonna do?

4508
02:53:22,430 --> 02:53:22,930
Kill him?

4509
02:53:23,470 --> 02:53:24,790
That's fucking right.

4510
02:53:25,110 --> 02:53:26,250
I'm gonna whip you.

4511
02:53:29,810 --> 02:53:30,890
Oh, shit!

4512
02:53:31,530 --> 02:53:31,610
Oh!

4513
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:34,270
Never mind.

4514
02:53:34,950 --> 02:53:36,110
Never mind.

4515
02:53:37,170 --> 02:53:39,410
Guess he's not getting whipped.

4516
02:53:39,810 --> 02:53:39,970
Wait.

4517
02:53:41,110 --> 02:53:42,210
Never mind.

4518
02:53:44,530 --> 02:53:45,890
I forgot.

4519
02:53:47,030 --> 02:53:48,650
Guys, it's a simple mistake.

4520
02:53:48,850 --> 02:53:49,870
I'll just headbutt.

4521
02:53:50,910 --> 02:53:51,750
Goodbye, husky.

4522
02:54:00,530 --> 02:54:02,970
Wait, wait, Hesley might be okay?

4523
02:54:03,230 --> 02:54:03,930
Alright, we'll try it.

4524
02:54:04,670 --> 02:54:06,550
No XP for you, husky.

4525
02:54:16,310 --> 02:54:17,390
Holy shit.

4526
02:54:17,570 --> 02:54:19,690
Okay, no XP for you too, I guess.

4527
02:54:20,190 --> 02:54:22,090
I... Jesus Christ!

4528
02:54:23,270 --> 02:54:23,650
Alright.

4529
02:54:25,210 --> 02:54:27,570
No XP for you as well.

4530
02:54:27,830 --> 02:54:28,610
Oh my god.

4531
02:54:28,770 --> 02:54:31,210
Guys, I think he actually is the ultimate gamer.

4532
02:54:31,650 --> 02:54:37,750
Guys, I think he might be... He might actually be the ultimate gamer.

4533
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:39,050
You cheated!

4534
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:40,970
I caught him baton pass!

4535
02:54:44,010 --> 02:54:45,970
Guys, I think he might be...

4536
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:54,830
Oh, he wants to learn grudge.

4537
02:54:54,910 --> 02:54:55,830
Wait, what does grudge do?

4538
02:54:57,810 --> 02:54:59,410
Oh, no, we don't need that.

4539
02:55:00,870 --> 02:55:01,430
Yeah.

4540
02:55:04,090 --> 02:55:07,130
That's true... I don't know, but that can take him.

4541
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:16,020
What the fuck is that?

4542
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:18,340
He's gonna throw it.

4543
02:55:19,460 --> 02:55:20,620
I'm gonna cross chop.

4544
02:55:22,900 --> 02:55:24,320
What the fuck is that?

4545
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:26,380
Oh, I keep forgetting that it's not very effective.

4546
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:26,820
Whoops.

4547
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:28,780
I... I don't know why.

4548
02:55:28,940 --> 02:55:30,840
I keep wanting to punch him.

4549
02:55:35,750 --> 02:55:36,850
I'm gonna burn it.

4550
02:55:43,620 --> 02:55:44,800
Wait, he can heal?

4551
02:55:44,940 --> 02:55:45,660
That's illegal!

4552
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,180
Ultimate gamer should not be using items.

4553
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,440
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

4554
02:55:50,580 --> 02:55:51,540
Thank you, thank you.

4555
02:55:53,460 --> 02:55:55,400
Explode, you know you want it.

4556
02:55:59,670 --> 02:56:00,670
Oh, no.

4557
02:56:01,190 --> 02:56:02,730
Dad, stop hurting yourself.

4558
02:56:03,250 --> 02:56:04,290
Dad, stop!

4559
02:56:05,730 --> 02:56:07,390
Stop hurting yourself!

4560
02:56:07,810 --> 02:56:08,230
I don't...

4561
02:56:08,230 --> 02:56:09,870
Oh, I don't have heal items.

4562
02:56:10,610 --> 02:56:11,210
Oh...

4563
02:56:11,830 --> 02:56:13,450
This is so bad.

4564
02:56:13,830 --> 02:56:17,330
Oh, I know if I kill him, I'm just gonna die by poison.

4565
02:56:18,270 --> 02:56:18,870
Um...

4566
02:56:19,790 --> 02:56:21,770
It's okay, Dragoon, this is it.

4567
02:56:22,430 --> 02:56:25,210
But I have... I have 99 hats, though.

4568
02:56:25,210 --> 02:56:27,550
I have 99 hats.

4569
02:56:30,210 --> 02:56:31,130
It's okay.

4570
02:56:32,730 --> 02:56:34,010
Just headbutt him.

4571
02:56:38,370 --> 02:56:39,250
Okay, nice.

4572
02:56:39,350 --> 02:56:39,970
Level 33.

4573
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:46,840
Alright, I'm going to...

4574
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:49,000
See if...

4575
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,220
Oh, wait, I could...

4576
02:56:50,220 --> 02:56:50,580
No!

4577
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:55,700
Okay, that's fine.

4578
02:56:55,800 --> 02:56:56,260
Headbutt.

4579
02:56:56,720 --> 02:56:57,800
How much damage do you do?

4580
02:56:57,920 --> 02:56:58,400
Okay, nothing.

4581
02:56:58,400 --> 02:56:59,200
Okay, it's fine.

4582
02:56:59,360 --> 02:57:00,200
We'll just keep headbutting.

4583
02:57:00,580 --> 02:57:01,560
Come on, Dragoon!

4584
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:03,340
Just use your head!

4585
02:57:08,550 --> 02:57:09,390
Oh, shit.

4586
02:57:09,610 --> 02:57:10,390
Okay, that's bad.

4587
02:57:10,610 --> 02:57:10,770
Alright.

4588
02:57:11,030 --> 02:57:11,610
I have...

4589
02:57:11,610 --> 02:57:12,710
I have...

4590
02:57:12,710 --> 02:57:14,390
I have a plan.

4591
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:18,490
I fall here.

4592
02:57:19,510 --> 02:57:19,990
Dad.

4593
02:57:22,370 --> 02:57:23,330
And then...

4594
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:26,950
Dragoon may or may not...

4595
02:57:26,950 --> 02:57:28,270
Okay, he's not gonna die.

4596
02:57:28,270 --> 02:57:28,570
I could.

4597
02:57:28,810 --> 02:57:28,970
I could.

4598
02:57:28,970 --> 02:57:28,970
Okay.

4599
02:57:29,610 --> 02:57:30,770
And then...

4600
02:57:32,230 --> 02:57:33,390
I headbutt.

4601
02:57:33,930 --> 02:57:35,270
I headbutt.

4602
02:57:37,190 --> 02:57:38,750
Oh my god.

4603
02:57:38,950 --> 02:57:41,110
Waluigi might have been the hardest one yet.

4604
02:57:45,570 --> 02:57:47,190
And then...

4605
02:57:49,490 --> 02:57:50,750
I headbutt.

4606
02:57:56,860 --> 02:57:58,060
And then...

4607
02:57:59,240 --> 02:58:00,840
No, Body Slam.

4608
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:04,740
Goodbye, Dragoon.

4609
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:05,340
Oh, shit!

4610
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:08,760
I Body Slam.

4611
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:09,880
Oh, goodbye Dragoon.

4612
02:58:10,560 --> 02:58:11,140
Never mind.

4613
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:12,240
I forgot I'm slow.

4614
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:17,340
Oh, shit.

4615
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:20,320
Okay, this is it.

4616
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:22,760
This is it.

4617
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:26,740
Do we make... Oh, thank God.

4618
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:27,580
We punch first.

4619
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:28,400
We punch first.

4620
02:58:30,200 --> 02:58:31,560
Oh, thank God.

4621
02:58:37,230 --> 02:58:38,890
Okay, there's hope.

4622
02:58:39,350 --> 02:58:40,530
There's hope, guys.

4623
02:58:43,630 --> 02:58:47,690
Guys, I think, like, maybe putting it all in on...

4624
02:58:51,890 --> 02:58:53,770
I have an idea.

4625
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:05,490
I... I have an idea.

4626
02:59:08,430 --> 02:59:09,630
Trust, guys.

4627
02:59:17,730 --> 02:59:19,110
It's time.

4628
02:59:19,370 --> 02:59:19,990
It's time.

4629
02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:20,550
Let's see.

4630
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:21,550
It's time.

4631
02:59:29,710 --> 02:59:30,710
What?!

4632
02:59:30,710 --> 02:59:32,230
But you healed!

4633
02:59:33,630 --> 02:59:34,630
What?!

4634
02:59:34,630 --> 02:59:36,370
There's no way!

4635
02:59:39,050 --> 02:59:40,050
What?!

4636
02:59:40,050 --> 02:59:43,030
He said it healed!

4637
02:59:43,030 --> 02:59:45,610
I was scammed!

4638
02:59:46,250 --> 02:59:47,470
I was scammed!

4639
02:59:47,950 --> 02:59:50,890
I was fucking scammed!

4640
02:59:51,210 --> 02:59:54,310
It was time to play dirty.

4641
02:59:54,810 --> 02:59:56,730
I can't believe it!

4642
02:59:57,270 --> 03:00:00,250
It's... I don't even remember what any of your moves are.

4643
03:00:00,450 --> 03:00:02,410
I don't even know.

4644
03:00:02,630 --> 03:00:04,690
What does anything do?

4645
03:00:04,870 --> 03:00:06,430
You have no attack?!

4646
03:00:06,430 --> 03:00:07,010
Attack!

4647
03:00:07,730 --> 03:00:08,030
Attack!

4648
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:09,170
Perish talk.

4649
03:00:09,410 --> 03:00:09,610
Okay.

4650
03:00:10,150 --> 03:00:10,590
We'll...

4651
03:00:10,590 --> 03:00:11,170
Oh my God.

4652
03:00:13,090 --> 03:00:13,930
Okay.

4653
03:00:14,430 --> 03:00:15,130
We'll use...

4654
03:00:15,130 --> 03:00:15,790
We'll use...

4655
03:00:15,790 --> 03:00:16,850
We'll use Perish talk.

4656
03:00:17,330 --> 03:00:17,630
We'll...

4657
03:00:17,630 --> 03:00:18,690
I don't...

4658
03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:26,110
I can't believe it.

4659
03:00:27,290 --> 03:00:28,970
We can do this.

4660
03:00:33,590 --> 03:00:34,410
Okay.

4661
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:38,560
Alright.

4662
03:00:39,020 --> 03:00:40,000
And then I'll curse.

4663
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:44,600
I can't...

4664
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:47,320
That would've been so funny if it worked though.

4665
03:00:47,320 --> 03:00:48,180
That...

4666
03:00:49,940 --> 03:00:50,760
That...

4667
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:52,020
That...

4668
03:00:52,020 --> 03:00:52,440
Guys.

4669
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:53,240
That...

4670
03:00:53,240 --> 03:00:53,380
That...

4671
03:00:53,380 --> 03:00:55,620
It would've been so good if it didn't...

4672
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:57,380
I'm so sad!

4673
03:00:57,960 --> 03:01:01,080
I'm so sad it didn't work!

4674
03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:15,720
It would've been so funny though!

4675
03:01:16,520 --> 03:01:18,660
It would've been so funny!

4676
03:01:18,900 --> 03:01:19,160
It would've been so funny!

4677
03:01:19,160 --> 03:01:19,920
Oh fuck!

4678
03:01:20,540 --> 03:01:21,600
Oh shit!

4679
03:01:26,140 --> 03:01:27,200
Okay.

4680
03:01:29,540 --> 03:01:31,580
I said I'll...

4681
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:32,700
Okay.

4682
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:34,580
This is very scary.

4683
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:35,540
I...

4684
03:01:35,540 --> 03:01:37,720
I don't know if he'll live.

4685
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:39,060
Oh fuck!

4686
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:40,220
Okay.

4687
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:42,620
Guys!

4688
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:44,520
It might be over.

4689
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:47,260
It might be over!

4690
03:01:51,080 --> 03:01:52,840
I don't have heals!

4691
03:01:53,360 --> 03:01:53,860
Guys!

4692
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:55,760
I have zero heals!

4693
03:01:58,440 --> 03:01:59,560
I have zero heals!

4694
03:01:59,560 --> 03:02:00,700
Oh no....

4695
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:06,980
Oh no!

4696
03:02:06,980 --> 03:02:07,020
Oh no!

4697
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:08,600
Oh no!

4698
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:09,840
Rest in peace!

4699
03:02:10,540 --> 03:02:12,440
He's- He was my first loss!

4700
03:02:12,980 --> 03:02:14,020
My actual...

4701
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:15,580
First loss!

4702
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:17,220
My actual first loss!

4703
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:20,300
Oh my god!

4704
03:02:22,900 --> 03:02:24,020
Okay.

4705
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:27,880
Okay.

4706
03:02:30,980 --> 03:02:32,060
Okay.

4707
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:32,100
Okay.

4708
03:02:32,440 --> 03:02:37,140
At least I'll whip my- NOOOOO!

4709
03:02:41,610 --> 03:02:42,690
NOOOOO!

4710
03:02:46,790 --> 03:02:48,930
He's- STOP!

4711
03:02:49,650 --> 03:02:53,010
Thank you for the super chat!

4712
03:02:53,890 --> 03:02:54,110
Yeah!

4713
03:02:54,790 --> 03:02:57,310
Waluigi is so strong!

4714
03:02:59,150 --> 03:03:01,130
You know I lost.

4715
03:03:01,430 --> 03:03:03,470
Dad heard me lose.

4716
03:03:04,270 --> 03:03:06,690
He's disappointed in me.

4717
03:03:06,910 --> 03:03:10,010
He's so... He's disappointed.

4718
03:03:10,910 --> 03:03:14,410
He's like, I can't believe you lost him!

4719
03:03:15,270 --> 03:03:16,750
We don't need heals.

4720
03:03:17,250 --> 03:03:18,790
We don't need heals.

4721
03:03:19,690 --> 03:03:21,910
We're so... We don't need it.

4722
03:03:22,010 --> 03:03:22,530
I've learned.

4723
03:03:23,130 --> 03:03:24,510
I've- No, I believe.

4724
03:03:24,510 --> 03:03:27,750
I... I learned!

4725
03:03:31,190 --> 03:03:31,890
It's okay.

4726
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:32,850
I figured it out.

4727
03:03:36,150 --> 03:03:38,370
I figured it out, guys.

4728
03:03:38,710 --> 03:03:39,330
It's okay.

4729
03:03:42,490 --> 03:03:43,390
It's okay.

4730
03:03:44,810 --> 03:03:46,090
Why are you so mad?

4731
03:03:49,150 --> 03:03:50,590
It's not food time!

4732
03:03:51,990 --> 03:03:53,370
I don't know why he's mad.

4733
03:03:54,810 --> 03:03:56,450
Oh no, not baton pass.

4734
03:03:56,590 --> 03:03:57,410
No, not you!

4735
03:03:57,410 --> 03:03:58,490
No!

4736
03:04:00,350 --> 03:04:01,410
Not you!

4737
03:04:02,330 --> 03:04:03,490
How did I kill him?

4738
03:04:03,570 --> 03:04:04,450
I don't remember!

4739
03:04:06,930 --> 03:04:09,330
I forgot how I killed him.

4740
03:04:13,450 --> 03:04:15,050
Not food time!

4741
03:04:15,370 --> 03:04:15,630
No!

4742
03:04:15,950 --> 03:04:16,230
No!

4743
03:04:16,930 --> 03:04:18,350
Not food time!

4744
03:04:19,290 --> 03:04:20,930
I'm not exploding!

4745
03:04:21,190 --> 03:04:21,370
Okay.

4746
03:04:21,530 --> 03:04:22,010
Head fight him.

4747
03:04:22,110 --> 03:04:22,390
You're right.

4748
03:04:23,030 --> 03:04:23,130
Wait.

4749
03:04:23,290 --> 03:04:25,170
Does Heftly survive this?

4750
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:26,470
I don't remember.

4751
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:28,610
Oh, I should curse him.

4752
03:04:28,730 --> 03:04:28,770
Oh, I should curse him.

4753
03:04:28,770 --> 03:04:29,170
You're right.

4754
03:04:29,430 --> 03:04:29,990
I should.

4755
03:04:31,170 --> 03:04:35,070
Okay, but when... The moment I send Ryzen... She's gonna die.

4756
03:04:40,760 --> 03:04:41,280
Okay.

4757
03:04:41,740 --> 03:04:42,440
That's fine.

4758
03:04:42,500 --> 03:04:43,240
We'll headbutt him.

4759
03:04:47,070 --> 03:04:47,590
Alright.

4760
03:04:48,670 --> 03:04:49,190
Nice.

4761
03:04:49,370 --> 03:04:49,530
Okay.

4762
03:04:50,090 --> 03:04:51,510
We body... We'll headbutt.

4763
03:04:54,790 --> 03:04:55,990
Okay, I guess not.

4764
03:04:56,810 --> 03:04:57,750
I guess not.

4765
03:04:57,930 --> 03:04:58,250
I'm poisoned.

4766
03:04:58,410 --> 03:04:58,850
Nevermind.

4767
03:04:59,970 --> 03:05:01,690
Baby, thank you for the super chat.

4768
03:05:01,830 --> 03:05:02,050
Thank you.

4769
03:05:02,270 --> 03:05:02,710
Thank you.

4770
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:04,310
I guess not.

4771
03:05:07,010 --> 03:05:07,910
Oh my god.

4772
03:05:08,070 --> 03:05:08,630
You fucker.

4773
03:05:09,030 --> 03:05:09,750
You fucker.

4774
03:05:11,910 --> 03:05:12,610
That's it.

4775
03:05:12,750 --> 03:05:13,290
I'm sorry.

4776
03:05:13,650 --> 03:05:14,890
I'm sorry, sickbug.

4777
03:05:15,050 --> 03:05:15,810
You're taking this.

4778
03:05:16,090 --> 03:05:17,370
You're taking this for me.

4779
03:05:21,690 --> 03:05:22,210
Goodbye.

4780
03:05:23,990 --> 03:05:24,950
Oh, nice!

4781
03:05:25,170 --> 03:05:25,430
Alright.

4782
03:05:25,710 --> 03:05:26,470
Come and dance.

4783
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:29,250
Dance for me.

4784
03:05:30,070 --> 03:05:32,170
Dance for me.

4785
03:05:32,170 --> 03:05:32,170
Dance.

4786
03:05:32,290 --> 03:05:33,570
Dance for me.

4787
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:37,730
Oh, I ate his thing.

4788
03:05:41,690 --> 03:05:42,330
Okay.

4789
03:05:42,630 --> 03:05:44,150
We don't feel so good.

4790
03:05:44,570 --> 03:05:45,570
Go keep dancing!

4791
03:05:49,390 --> 03:05:50,550
Keep dancing!

4792
03:05:51,310 --> 03:05:51,570
Alright.

4793
03:05:51,710 --> 03:05:51,910
Nice.

4794
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:52,970
Thanks for tanking it.

4795
03:05:53,670 --> 03:05:53,990
Alright.

4796
03:05:54,150 --> 03:05:55,510
Now that he's tanked it.

4797
03:05:56,830 --> 03:05:59,570
Now... Now, Dragoon, you can keep...

4798
03:05:59,570 --> 03:06:00,430
Keep headbutting him.

4799
03:06:02,450 --> 03:06:03,230
No, it's fine.

4800
03:06:03,390 --> 03:06:04,010
We don't need a heal.

4801
03:06:04,770 --> 03:06:05,850
Just keep headbutting.

4802
03:06:06,590 --> 03:06:07,950
He'll eventually kill him.

4803
03:06:09,170 --> 03:06:09,570
Okay.

4804
03:06:09,850 --> 03:06:10,510
You fucker.

4805
03:06:10,650 --> 03:06:10,910
Alright.

4806
03:06:14,330 --> 03:06:15,090
You know what?

4807
03:06:15,390 --> 03:06:16,490
I can tank it.

4808
03:06:21,710 --> 03:06:22,610
Yeah, I knew it.

4809
03:06:22,690 --> 03:06:23,530
I knew I could tank it.

4810
03:06:23,690 --> 03:06:23,830
Good.

4811
03:06:23,950 --> 03:06:24,130
Okay.

4812
03:06:24,270 --> 03:06:24,650
That's good.

4813
03:06:25,150 --> 03:06:25,710
That's good.

4814
03:06:25,890 --> 03:06:29,070
He... I got... I got a little worried.

4815
03:06:29,730 --> 03:06:32,550
I... Dragoon, you will die for me.

4816
03:06:33,310 --> 03:06:35,470
You will have to die for it.

4817
03:06:35,770 --> 03:06:36,330
For the cause.

4818
03:06:37,650 --> 03:06:37,950
Yay!

4819
03:06:48,820 --> 03:06:49,480
Yay!

4820
03:06:49,980 --> 03:06:50,220
No!

4821
03:06:53,440 --> 03:06:55,420
Dragoon, it's for the cause!

4822
03:06:55,700 --> 03:06:57,180
It's for the team!

4823
03:06:57,720 --> 03:06:58,100
No.

4824
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:00,780
My life, fire.

4825
03:07:01,320 --> 03:07:06,080
My life, but don't keep... It was for the team, guys!

4826
03:07:06,540 --> 03:07:08,480
It was for... For the team!

4827
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:10,340
It's for the greater good!

4828
03:07:16,380 --> 03:07:17,580
Remember us.

4829
03:07:17,740 --> 03:07:18,360
Witness.

4830
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:19,140
I witnessed.

4831
03:07:19,500 --> 03:07:19,620
Okay?

4832
03:07:19,860 --> 03:07:20,980
Guys, I witnessed you.

4833
03:07:30,050 --> 03:07:31,130
No, it's fine.

4834
03:07:31,430 --> 03:07:31,930
It'll be okay.

4835
03:07:32,310 --> 03:07:34,030
I believe Dad will be fine.

4836
03:07:38,070 --> 03:07:39,450
You'll be fine, Dad.

4837
03:07:45,950 --> 03:07:46,590
Oh.

4838
03:07:47,090 --> 03:07:48,210
I don't know anymore.

4839
03:07:50,730 --> 03:07:51,890
It won't.

4840
03:07:52,090 --> 03:07:53,310
It'll be fine.

4841
03:07:54,050 --> 03:07:55,490
It'll be...

4842
03:08:03,930 --> 03:08:06,130
Okay, maybe he won't be fine.

4843
03:08:07,390 --> 03:08:07,950
Okay.

4844
03:08:09,910 --> 03:08:10,810
Alright, Rice.

4845
03:08:13,050 --> 03:08:13,950
I... What?

4846
03:08:14,250 --> 03:08:14,650
Okay.

4847
03:08:14,930 --> 03:08:16,070
Oh, guys.

4848
03:08:17,270 --> 03:08:18,450
No, I forgot to change!

4849
03:08:18,730 --> 03:08:19,290
Oh, fuck!

4850
03:08:19,530 --> 03:08:20,290
I pressed B!

4851
03:08:22,190 --> 03:08:23,670
He won't kill me, right?

4852
03:08:26,650 --> 03:08:28,910
He's not gonna kill me, right?

4853
03:08:34,070 --> 03:08:35,270
It'll be fine, right?

4854
03:08:36,030 --> 03:08:36,470
Oh, yeah.

4855
03:08:36,570 --> 03:08:37,070
I'll be fine.

4856
03:08:38,050 --> 03:08:38,590
Alright, punch.

4857
03:08:43,810 --> 03:08:44,490
Okay, nice.

4858
03:08:44,590 --> 03:08:45,150
That's critical.

4859
03:08:45,310 --> 03:08:45,830
That is good.

4860
03:08:45,990 --> 03:08:46,730
That is good.

4861
03:08:54,040 --> 03:08:55,180
Alright, how many more?

4862
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,020
Huff and Puff.

4863
03:08:56,300 --> 03:08:57,640
How do we kill Huff and Puff?

4864
03:08:57,680 --> 03:08:57,980
Oh.

4865
03:08:58,240 --> 03:08:59,740
I remember how we killed Huff and Puff.

4866
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:04,520
That's like... How do... Oh, wait.

4867
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:05,300
No, I remember.

4868
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:08,540
I remember how we killed Huff and Puff.

4869
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:09,360
I...

4870
03:09:11,960 --> 03:09:15,080
It's okay, we don't need to do that anymore.

4871
03:09:15,280 --> 03:09:18,300
We don't need- Guys, we don't need to do that anymore.

4872
03:09:18,880 --> 03:09:21,180
We- We sort of went kabloo-ee.

4873
03:09:26,500 --> 03:09:29,360
I know we didn't- I shouldn't use that, but I just couldn't be bothered.

4874
03:09:35,850 --> 03:09:38,430
Alright, now we use the other one.

4875
03:09:38,830 --> 03:09:40,890
Are you fucking kidding me?!

4876
03:09:43,530 --> 03:09:44,910
Okay, how much damage?

4877
03:09:45,170 --> 03:09:46,190
Okay, now...

4878
03:09:47,790 --> 03:09:52,010
What if I just- Now we do this.

4879
03:09:52,530 --> 03:09:54,110
No, no, no, it's fine.

4880
03:09:54,270 --> 03:09:54,710
I believe.

4881
03:09:55,050 --> 03:09:57,650
I believe in- AGAIN?!

4882
03:09:57,650 --> 03:09:59,950
You can't keep baton-passing each other!

4883
03:10:01,070 --> 03:10:04,610
You can't- You can't keep doing that!

4884
03:10:07,890 --> 03:10:08,570
Alright.

4885
03:10:10,430 --> 03:10:11,910
What's the point?

4886
03:10:11,910 --> 03:10:14,650
He spent time chaining.

4887
03:10:15,210 --> 03:10:16,470
That fucker!

4888
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:22,820
Alright, Swoop.

4889
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:23,720
Get out of here.

4890
03:10:27,620 --> 03:10:28,240
Punch!

4891
03:10:28,720 --> 03:10:29,700
Oh shit.

4892
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:30,960
Oh fuck!

4893
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:31,800
Oh, I forgot.

4894
03:10:32,120 --> 03:10:35,180
That was- It's time, Dad.

4895
03:10:36,100 --> 03:10:36,920
Oh, never mind.

4896
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:37,420
You're strong.

4897
03:10:37,580 --> 03:10:37,720
Okay.

4898
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:41,760
See, I told you.

4899
03:10:41,920 --> 03:10:42,620
I learned.

4900
03:10:44,380 --> 03:10:48,220
I figured- I just needed to sacrifice a couple of people.

4901
03:10:49,420 --> 03:10:50,740
For the cause.

4902
03:10:55,360 --> 03:10:56,080
What?

4903
03:11:04,330 --> 03:11:05,590
Waluigi disappeared?

4904
03:11:06,010 --> 03:11:08,550
And left behind the Casino Kingdom's power star?

4905
03:11:10,970 --> 03:11:12,030
First try.

4906
03:11:12,390 --> 03:11:12,950
Look at that.

4907
03:11:14,990 --> 03:11:16,170
What TM did I get?

4908
03:11:20,770 --> 03:11:22,550
Has the sound been okay throughout it?

4909
03:11:22,610 --> 03:11:23,610
I know I sound weird.

4910
03:11:25,750 --> 03:11:27,430
Waluigi's famous warp powder.

4911
03:11:27,690 --> 03:11:29,550
Shortcut to wherever your hearts desire.

4912
03:11:30,110 --> 03:11:31,650
Use the so-called- Yeah, sure.

4913
03:11:34,230 --> 03:11:34,750
Oh!

4914
03:11:34,950 --> 03:11:36,390
Oh, it took me back in the beginning.

4915
03:11:41,910 --> 03:11:42,430
Heh!

4916
03:11:42,730 --> 03:11:44,970
Think you can't get the power star without paying up?

4917
03:11:45,250 --> 03:11:46,830
The boss sends his regards.

4918
03:11:47,050 --> 03:11:47,350
Oh!

4919
03:11:47,730 --> 03:11:48,890
Oh, it was just 300.

4920
03:11:49,230 --> 03:11:54,250
From now on, you better be prepared to pay your interest on that loan you took from the boss.

4921
03:11:54,570 --> 03:11:56,310
And you don't have the purple coins?

4922
03:11:56,450 --> 03:11:56,930
Wait!

4923
03:11:57,450 --> 03:12:00,130
We'll start taking your actual coins, too.

4924
03:12:00,730 --> 03:12:01,470
Now then.

4925
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:02,410
Scram!

4926
03:12:02,990 --> 03:12:03,910
Wait, what?

4927
03:12:05,470 --> 03:12:06,850
Wait, they...

4928
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:09,150
They can take my...

4929
03:12:09,330 --> 03:12:09,770
Wait...

4930
03:12:10,770 --> 03:12:11,650
Wait...

4931
03:12:11,650 --> 03:12:13,770
They can take my real coins?

4932
03:12:16,610 --> 03:12:17,490
Wait...

4933
03:12:18,610 --> 03:12:21,270
Wait, so like...

4934
03:12:21,270 --> 03:12:23,490
But I have...

4935
03:12:23,490 --> 03:12:25,810
But I have 99 caps!

4936
03:12:27,570 --> 03:12:28,010
Wait...

4937
03:12:29,630 --> 03:12:31,390
Wait, what do I do?

4938
03:12:31,810 --> 03:12:33,150
What do I...

4939
03:12:33,150 --> 03:12:34,010
What?

4940
03:12:34,550 --> 03:12:34,890
What?

4941
03:12:35,130 --> 03:12:35,350
What?

4942
03:12:35,350 --> 03:12:35,370
What?

4943
03:12:35,370 --> 03:12:35,410
What?

4944
03:12:35,410 --> 03:12:36,250
Can I fight him?

4945
03:12:39,670 --> 03:12:40,990
Please, sir.

4946
03:12:41,150 --> 03:12:42,670
I didn't mean to.

4947
03:12:44,130 --> 03:12:45,750
Main Street is a dangerous...

4948
03:12:45,750 --> 03:12:47,150
Don't blame it on me.

4949
03:12:47,450 --> 03:12:48,630
Oh my god.

4950
03:12:48,870 --> 03:12:49,290
He...

4951
03:12:49,290 --> 03:12:49,630
What?

4952
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:51,090
I...

4953
03:12:51,090 --> 03:12:53,190
What is the interest rate?

4954
03:12:53,590 --> 03:12:54,050
What?

4955
03:12:54,570 --> 03:12:55,290
What?

4956
03:12:56,050 --> 03:12:56,410
What?

4957
03:12:56,410 --> 03:12:56,990
Oh my god.

4958
03:12:57,010 --> 03:12:57,890
I gotta spend my money!

4959
03:12:58,350 --> 03:12:59,990
I gotta spend all my money!

4960
03:13:00,310 --> 03:13:02,930
I gotta spend all my money!

4961
03:13:03,570 --> 03:13:06,630
If I spend all my money, they can't steal it from me.

4962
03:13:07,450 --> 03:13:09,030
Alright, I wanna see if I can...

4963
03:13:09,030 --> 03:13:10,990
Let me see if I can find a Shy Guy.

4964
03:13:11,030 --> 03:13:12,510
Okay, I'm gonna do five more encounters.

4965
03:13:14,790 --> 03:13:17,650
You're right, they can't steal any of I don't have money.

4966
03:13:17,890 --> 03:13:18,570
You're so right.

4967
03:13:19,350 --> 03:13:20,830
Alright, we're gonna see if we can find...

4968
03:13:20,830 --> 03:13:21,450
I'll do...

4969
03:13:21,450 --> 03:13:22,530
Two encounters.

4970
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:32,260
Oh, I should save my game?

4971
03:13:32,360 --> 03:13:32,980
Yeah, I'll save it.

4972
03:13:36,300 --> 03:13:36,960
You're right.

4973
03:13:40,030 --> 03:13:40,870
Alright.

4974
03:13:40,870 --> 03:13:41,070
Bum bum.

4975
03:13:42,270 --> 03:13:43,870
Ba dum ba dum ba dum.

4976
03:13:46,110 --> 03:13:47,730
Alright, no Shy Guy.

4977
03:13:48,170 --> 03:13:49,150
God dammit.

4978
03:13:49,270 --> 03:13:50,690
I just wanna Shy Guy.

4979
03:13:52,930 --> 03:13:55,250
Guys, I have 99 hats.

4980
03:13:56,270 --> 03:13:59,410
I have 99 hats, guys.

4981
03:14:05,030 --> 03:14:06,650
So many hats.

4982
03:14:11,730 --> 03:14:13,730
Okay, let's go back to Toe Town.

4983
03:14:15,610 --> 03:14:17,470
Okay, we gotta spend our money.

4984
03:14:17,710 --> 03:14:21,450
We gotta spend our money before they take it off.

4985
03:14:23,110 --> 03:14:23,930
Let's see.

4986
03:14:24,170 --> 03:14:25,630
We need...

4987
03:14:32,800 --> 03:14:34,220
Okay, let's get healers.

4988
03:14:35,140 --> 03:14:36,640
Oh, what the TM is?

4989
03:14:36,820 --> 03:14:37,680
Okay, what is it?

4990
03:14:38,300 --> 03:14:38,840
Pocket.

4991
03:14:42,480 --> 03:14:43,480
Where are my TMs?

4992
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:45,960
Key items...

4993
03:14:45,960 --> 03:14:46,620
Oh, there it is.

4994
03:14:46,760 --> 03:14:47,180
Fuse.

4995
03:14:47,620 --> 03:14:48,260
What did I get?

4996
03:14:50,880 --> 03:14:52,780
I don't remember what number it was.

4997
03:14:53,020 --> 03:14:53,800
Do you guys know?

4998
03:14:54,400 --> 03:14:55,120
Was it D...

4999
03:14:55,120 --> 03:14:55,740
Uh...

5000
03:14:55,740 --> 03:14:56,380
Was it Thief?

5001
03:14:58,480 --> 03:14:59,740
I have no idea.

5002
03:15:02,380 --> 03:15:03,100
Oh, 74?

5003
03:15:03,100 --> 03:15:04,880
Oh, it was Cross Poison.

5004
03:15:06,080 --> 03:15:06,880
Oh.

5005
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:08,640
Oh.

5006
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:09,200
Okay, let's...

5007
03:15:09,780 --> 03:15:11,220
War Putt.

5008
03:15:11,540 --> 03:15:12,420
We gotta go to...

5009
03:15:12,660 --> 03:15:13,540
Diamond City.

5010
03:15:14,960 --> 03:15:17,020
So we can buy good items.

5011
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:20,420
So he can't steal my items.

5012
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:23,760
Can't steal my items if I'm fucking broke!

5013
03:15:23,780 --> 03:15:24,740
Let's go!

5014
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:26,800
Is it here?

5015
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:28,300
Buy.

5016
03:15:29,260 --> 03:15:30,160
Super Shroom.

5017
03:15:30,340 --> 03:15:31,160
Okay, we need that.

5018
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:35,140
Buy three Super Shrooms.

5019
03:15:37,260 --> 03:15:37,780
Okay.

5020
03:15:39,780 --> 03:15:41,180
I already can't steal it.

5021
03:15:41,440 --> 03:15:42,000
What are you gonna do?

5022
03:15:42,100 --> 03:15:42,800
Break my...

5023
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:43,760
Break my bones?

5024
03:15:44,660 --> 03:15:46,100
I like to see them try.

5025
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:49,700
Can't break my bones if I break them first!

5026
03:15:53,270 --> 03:15:56,230
I don't remember what each floor has.

5027
03:15:58,070 --> 03:15:59,190
Oh, it's for this.

5028
03:15:59,410 --> 03:16:01,190
To know my kneecaps.

5029
03:16:02,870 --> 03:16:06,310
Can't steal my organs if I sell my organs first!

5030
03:16:06,910 --> 03:16:07,810
Think about that.

5031
03:16:10,110 --> 03:16:11,310
Okay, we'll buy...

5032
03:16:13,330 --> 03:16:14,050
Actually...

5033
03:16:14,050 --> 03:16:15,870
Yeah, we'll buy Antidote too.

5034
03:16:16,230 --> 03:16:17,370
Just buy more healers.

5035
03:16:18,790 --> 03:16:19,490
There we go.

5036
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:20,390
True.

5037
03:16:21,070 --> 03:16:24,150
If I lick all of my coins, they won't steal it as well.

5038
03:16:24,390 --> 03:16:24,850
Oh my god.

5039
03:16:25,010 --> 03:16:25,410
Good plan.

5040
03:16:25,570 --> 03:16:26,210
Good plan, guys.

5041
03:16:26,810 --> 03:16:27,330
Good plan!

5042
03:16:31,370 --> 03:16:32,510
Oh wait, not here.

5043
03:16:34,990 --> 03:16:35,850
Alright, Dragoon!

5044
03:16:35,910 --> 03:16:36,350
Lick them!

5045
03:16:39,690 --> 03:16:40,170
Dragoon!

5046
03:16:40,310 --> 03:16:40,870
Lick it!

5047
03:16:41,210 --> 03:16:42,650
I licked my coins!

5048
03:16:47,970 --> 03:16:49,650
Is this world...

5049
03:16:50,150 --> 03:16:51,030
World 5?

5050
03:16:53,090 --> 03:16:54,130
World 5?

5051
03:16:54,130 --> 03:16:54,150
World 5?

5052
03:17:01,150 --> 03:17:03,070
We're in the tall grass area.

5053
03:17:03,570 --> 03:17:04,950
Uh-huh!

5054
03:17:05,510 --> 03:17:07,630
Club Cros is thinking of the Super- Oh!

5055
03:17:07,710 --> 03:17:08,430
It's a Wiggler!

5056
03:17:11,210 --> 03:17:11,930
Okay!

5057
03:17:13,450 --> 03:17:15,330
You know what that means.

5058
03:17:25,030 --> 03:17:25,530
Go.

5059
03:17:27,890 --> 03:17:28,930
Oh my god.

5060
03:17:29,190 --> 03:17:33,370
Okay, I realized that we are... Wait.

5061
03:17:33,930 --> 03:17:35,610
We got to die instantly.

5062
03:17:35,870 --> 03:17:36,370
Wait a minute.

5063
03:17:36,630 --> 03:17:40,470
Okay, I realized the wiggler is, like, pretty strong.

5064
03:17:44,430 --> 03:17:45,230
Oh, wait.

5065
03:17:45,470 --> 03:17:47,030
I want to see how angry it looks.

5066
03:17:48,010 --> 03:17:49,370
How angry will you be?

5067
03:17:53,050 --> 03:17:54,690
Oh my god, he angry.

5068
03:17:55,010 --> 03:17:57,950
Oh my god, why did you guys tell me to make him...

5069
03:18:01,850 --> 03:18:03,630
Okay, I can use an ice storm throw then.

5070
03:18:11,830 --> 03:18:14,470
Now, congrats, now he's at six... Wait.

5071
03:18:14,850 --> 03:18:17,590
You can't jump if I throw a ball at you.

5072
03:18:19,290 --> 03:18:20,110
That's right.

5073
03:18:20,590 --> 03:18:22,610
Oh, never mind, you can't.

5074
03:18:23,410 --> 03:18:24,290
Never mind.

5075
03:18:24,290 --> 03:18:25,510
Alright.

5076
03:18:26,170 --> 03:18:28,330
I'm sorry, stick bug.

5077
03:18:33,950 --> 03:18:35,010
I'm sorry.

5078
03:18:36,110 --> 03:18:36,930
Goodbye.

5079
03:18:38,570 --> 03:18:40,430
Someone has to die.

5080
03:18:46,430 --> 03:18:47,810
Get stick bug.

5081
03:18:51,570 --> 03:18:53,030
I'm eating chips right now.

5082
03:19:00,260 --> 03:19:00,860
Yay!

5083
03:19:01,580 --> 03:19:02,520
Who wants to be wiggler?

5084
03:19:07,230 --> 03:19:07,830
Okay.

5085
03:19:08,350 --> 03:19:09,170
It's the...

5086
03:19:12,010 --> 03:19:12,610
Um...

5087
03:19:12,610 --> 03:19:13,930
The honey Dijon one.

5088
03:19:14,410 --> 03:19:14,970
You know the...

5089
03:19:14,970 --> 03:19:15,830
The kettle chips?

5090
03:19:16,090 --> 03:19:17,110
I love those.

5091
03:19:25,270 --> 03:19:27,770
A caterpillar, the worst temper in the world.

5092
03:19:28,070 --> 03:19:29,650
If you ever see one moving...

5093
03:19:31,890 --> 03:19:33,650
Alon, choose your actions carefully.

5094
03:19:33,950 --> 03:19:34,770
It's trampling powers.

5095
03:19:34,930 --> 03:19:35,530
It's incomparable.

5096
03:19:38,590 --> 03:19:39,190
Alright.

5097
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:44,360
Let's see.

5098
03:19:44,940 --> 03:19:46,340
Oh, do you hear me?

5099
03:19:46,600 --> 03:19:47,520
My crunches?

5100
03:19:47,520 --> 03:19:49,620
I've seen a lot of angry...

5101
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:51,600
But this one might be the angriest red.

5102
03:19:51,820 --> 03:19:52,120
What?

5103
03:19:52,420 --> 03:19:53,140
Not so joker.

5104
03:19:53,300 --> 03:19:54,100
Thank you for the super chat.

5105
03:19:54,260 --> 03:19:54,480
Thank you.

5106
03:19:54,520 --> 03:19:54,900
Thank you.

5107
03:19:55,020 --> 03:19:55,200
Alright.

5108
03:19:56,040 --> 03:19:56,700
I mute.

5109
03:19:57,500 --> 03:19:58,280
Ha ha ha!

5110
03:19:58,560 --> 03:19:59,160
Ha ha ha!

5111
03:20:00,140 --> 03:20:01,180
It's Mehdi's fault.

5112
03:20:21,450 --> 03:20:21,890
Alright.

5113
03:20:21,890 --> 03:20:22,890
Who wants to be wiggler again?

5114
03:20:23,670 --> 03:20:24,450
I don't remember.

5115
03:20:25,070 --> 03:20:26,170
I was eating my chips.

5116
03:20:28,690 --> 03:20:30,370
Just remember whose fault it is.

5117
03:20:34,280 --> 03:20:34,940
Ha ha ha!

5118
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:35,480
Me!

5119
03:20:36,380 --> 03:20:37,240
Alright, Sai.

5120
03:20:37,500 --> 03:20:38,240
I'll give it to you.

5121
03:20:39,380 --> 03:20:40,260
Sai Goon.

5122
03:20:50,170 --> 03:20:50,610
Goon.

5123
03:20:51,050 --> 03:20:51,450
Alright.

5124
03:20:56,810 --> 03:20:57,250
Zanir!

5125
03:20:57,350 --> 03:20:58,250
Thank you for the super chat.

5126
03:20:58,350 --> 03:20:58,570
Thank you.

5127
03:20:58,710 --> 03:20:59,170
Thank you.

5128
03:20:59,290 --> 03:21:00,710
Hey, I'm a pretty angry dude.

5129
03:21:00,750 --> 03:21:02,570
If you're still taking super names...

5130
03:21:02,570 --> 03:21:02,970
Oh, don't worry.

5131
03:21:03,030 --> 03:21:03,830
You can beat this guy.

5132
03:21:04,230 --> 03:21:04,770
Ha ha ha!

5133
03:21:04,910 --> 03:21:06,510
The opposite of the...

5134
03:21:06,510 --> 03:21:07,330
The wiggler.

5135
03:21:07,570 --> 03:21:07,910
Ha ha ha!

5136
03:21:08,050 --> 03:21:08,970
Ha ha ha!

5137
03:21:09,070 --> 03:21:09,770
Ha ha ha!

5138
03:21:09,770 --> 03:21:09,870
Ha ha ha!

5139
03:21:10,650 --> 03:21:12,330
Zanir Man, thank you for the super chat.

5140
03:21:12,470 --> 03:21:12,750
Thank you.

5141
03:21:12,890 --> 03:21:13,470
Thank you.

5142
03:21:13,750 --> 03:21:14,770
I'm gonna be this guy.

5143
03:21:15,110 --> 03:21:16,690
This fucking garlic looking thing.

5144
03:21:18,270 --> 03:21:19,170
Oh my god.

5145
03:21:19,210 --> 03:21:19,770
I'm asleep.

5146
03:21:20,510 --> 03:21:21,630
I'm just gonna throw the ball.

5147
03:21:21,790 --> 03:21:22,790
Just for the sake of it.

5148
03:21:27,650 --> 03:21:27,990
Wait.

5149
03:21:28,050 --> 03:21:28,750
I almost had it.

5150
03:21:34,270 --> 03:21:34,710
Wait.

5151
03:21:34,730 --> 03:21:35,670
I'm gonna just throw another one.

5152
03:21:57,340 --> 03:21:57,780
Yeah!

5153
03:21:58,420 --> 03:21:59,900
A flower that yearns for flight.

5154
03:22:00,080 --> 03:22:03,640
When it blooms, it'll spin around and creates platforms for others to jump and launch.

5155
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:05,240
Spreading its pollen.

5156
03:22:06,540 --> 03:22:06,620
Spreading its pollen.

5157
03:22:06,620 --> 03:22:06,820
All right.

5158
03:22:07,520 --> 03:22:08,480
Zander Goon.

5159
03:22:13,250 --> 03:22:16,710
How many mons is there in this game, anyway?

5160
03:22:19,670 --> 03:22:21,010
Oh, just enough.

5161
03:22:21,810 --> 03:22:23,850
I feel like we've encountered so many already.

5162
03:22:23,850 --> 03:22:24,710
Wonder 51.

5163
03:22:25,010 --> 03:22:26,070
Oh, it's just like the original.

5164
03:22:28,950 --> 03:22:29,910
Just like the original.

5165
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:30,490
Oh my god.

5166
03:22:30,510 --> 03:22:32,070
I have to...

5167
03:22:32,070 --> 03:22:33,470
Let me just heal him.

5168
03:22:35,290 --> 03:22:35,830
Fuck it.

5169
03:22:36,930 --> 03:22:38,050
I'm just gonna use it now.

5170
03:22:39,530 --> 03:22:40,770
I can't be bothered.

5171
03:22:41,790 --> 03:22:42,990
I heard there's...

5172
03:22:42,990 --> 03:22:45,190
Yeah, there's like one legendary or something, right?

5173
03:22:52,010 --> 03:22:52,550
All right.

5174
03:22:52,610 --> 03:22:53,370
Let's get out of here.

5175
03:22:55,250 --> 03:22:56,270
Anything else?

5176
03:22:58,430 --> 03:22:58,790
Oh!

5177
03:22:59,030 --> 03:23:00,290
It's Dino Rino!

5178
03:23:01,270 --> 03:23:02,630
Oh, it's this guy.

5179
03:23:04,150 --> 03:23:05,190
I remember this guy.

5180
03:23:06,150 --> 03:23:07,950
I remember from what game, but I remember...

5181
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:09,010
No, it's from...

5182
03:23:09,010 --> 03:23:09,650
Ah, blah, blah, blah.

5183
03:23:09,670 --> 03:23:09,770
What?

5184
03:23:09,790 --> 03:23:11,450
My favorite Mario game.

5185
03:23:12,450 --> 03:23:13,190
I know this.

5186
03:23:13,270 --> 03:23:14,890
This is from my favorite Mario game.

5187
03:23:15,090 --> 03:23:16,210
Oh, I forgot the name of it.

5188
03:23:16,410 --> 03:23:17,150
I love this game.

5189
03:23:18,790 --> 03:23:19,890
Yeah, from Mario World.

5190
03:23:20,030 --> 03:23:20,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5191
03:23:20,770 --> 03:23:21,710
From Mario World.

5192
03:23:22,610 --> 03:23:23,830
Super Mario World.

5193
03:23:24,830 --> 03:23:25,990
It's my favorite one.

5194
03:23:26,910 --> 03:23:29,470
Oh, I keep... whoops.

5195
03:23:29,890 --> 03:23:34,270
I used the move twice because I was like, I'm gonna... I don't know why it didn't work.

5196
03:23:34,450 --> 03:23:36,270
I didn't read it, so I'll use it again.

5197
03:23:38,250 --> 03:23:40,410
I was like, why didn't it work?

5198
03:23:40,610 --> 03:23:41,150
Well, whatever.

5199
03:23:41,410 --> 03:23:42,390
Let me use it again.

5200
03:23:49,670 --> 03:23:51,270
Alright, time to catch him.

5201
03:23:58,610 --> 03:23:59,010
Yay!

5202
03:23:59,890 --> 03:24:00,290
Donorano!

5203
03:24:00,950 --> 03:24:02,370
It wants to be Donorano.

5204
03:24:14,570 --> 03:24:17,930
A hulking herby-vorous dinosaur.

5205
03:24:18,150 --> 03:24:21,370
When it reaches maturity, it learns to give up its fire, but...

5206
03:24:21,370 --> 03:24:23,810
This is seen as a rite of passage.

5207
03:24:24,110 --> 03:24:25,370
Thank you for the super chat, Carl.

5208
03:24:25,510 --> 03:24:26,270
Thank you, thank you.

5209
03:24:26,390 --> 03:24:27,650
Can I be Donorano?

5210
03:24:27,830 --> 03:24:28,550
Yeah, you can!

5211
03:24:30,210 --> 03:24:31,010
Alright, Carl.

5212
03:24:31,010 --> 03:24:31,870
Hehehe.

5213
03:24:32,530 --> 03:24:32,950
Hehehe.

5214
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:33,590
My Donorano.

5215
03:24:33,710 --> 03:24:34,050
Carl.

5216
03:24:34,450 --> 03:24:34,770
Hehehe.

5217
03:24:34,950 --> 03:24:35,450
Carl!

5218
03:24:36,290 --> 03:24:37,490
Why, Carl?

5219
03:24:38,170 --> 03:24:38,790
Why?

5220
03:24:40,070 --> 03:24:41,570
Alright, Carl-goon.

5221
03:24:43,630 --> 03:24:44,250
Alright.

5222
03:24:44,550 --> 03:24:46,590
I wonder if I can use a Yoshi...

5223
03:24:46,590 --> 03:24:47,470
Oh, I can't.

5224
03:24:47,590 --> 03:24:49,610
The tall grass won't let me use a Yoshi-wissa.

5225
03:24:52,130 --> 03:24:54,070
Okay, I don't know if there's any more...

5226
03:24:54,770 --> 03:24:55,930
...blood encounter.

5227
03:24:56,250 --> 03:24:57,750
So I'm gonna...

5228
03:24:57,750 --> 03:24:59,470
I'm just gonna head down.

5229
03:25:02,930 --> 03:25:03,850
Who's that?

5230
03:25:05,370 --> 03:25:06,010
Bowser?

5231
03:25:06,470 --> 03:25:06,930
Again?

5232
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:12,200
Tell me I gotta be Frank.

5233
03:25:12,200 --> 03:25:14,060
Of course, my Frank.

5234
03:25:14,660 --> 03:25:16,240
No, I mean...

5235
03:25:16,240 --> 03:25:17,560
How'd you do that?

5236
03:25:18,120 --> 03:25:18,680
Do what?

5237
03:25:19,920 --> 03:25:20,440
You...

5238
03:25:20,440 --> 03:25:21,180
Do not...

5239
03:25:21,180 --> 03:25:21,400
My...

5240
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:22,560
My name is not Frank.

5241
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:24,540
Oh, thank you, sire.

5242
03:25:25,300 --> 03:25:27,020
But what I was gonna say...

5243
03:25:27,020 --> 03:25:31,280
The harsh reality is that we're not getting those Power Stars before Mario will.

5244
03:25:31,600 --> 03:25:33,000
We just can't keep up.

5245
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:34,580
But, sire.

5246
03:25:35,020 --> 03:25:36,460
Then we just keep trying.

5247
03:25:37,260 --> 03:25:38,000
Oh, oh, oh.

5248
03:25:38,100 --> 03:25:39,420
You didn't let me finish.

5249
03:25:39,880 --> 03:25:41,480
We may not keep up.

5250
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:45,000
But someone else can.

5251
03:25:46,060 --> 03:25:47,580
Luigi, you fuck.

5252
03:25:47,580 --> 03:25:48,500
I knew it.

5253
03:25:49,320 --> 03:25:49,760
Wow.

5254
03:25:50,840 --> 03:25:54,900
The jungle kingdom is looking extra green today, bro.

5255
03:25:55,400 --> 03:25:58,220
I wonder where I'll get my fifth Power Star.

5256
03:25:58,740 --> 03:26:00,440
Better get a move on.

5257
03:26:02,500 --> 03:26:04,440
Kamek, my dearest ally.

5258
03:26:04,840 --> 03:26:05,900
I had to say it.

5259
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:08,100
But I'm not having much fun anymore.

5260
03:26:08,740 --> 03:26:09,420
Your Highness.

5261
03:26:09,820 --> 03:26:11,580
I am flabbergasted.

5262
03:26:12,660 --> 03:26:18,480
Surely running around these different wonderfully colorful worlds have enticed you to keep playing along.

5263
03:26:18,780 --> 03:26:19,760
Has it not?

5264
03:26:23,710 --> 03:26:25,230
Yes, it's true.

5265
03:26:25,590 --> 03:26:30,370
Even after I mercilessly defeated Mario every single encounter we have.

5266
03:26:30,370 --> 03:26:33,630
I'm just not having a good time.

5267
03:26:34,250 --> 03:26:37,410
Then, maybe it's best we go home.

5268
03:26:38,830 --> 03:26:39,590
Pousey.

5269
03:26:39,790 --> 03:26:42,230
You're not having fun with your captures?

5270
03:26:42,670 --> 03:26:43,530
Mamma mia.

5271
03:26:44,510 --> 03:26:45,130
Luigi.

5272
03:26:46,050 --> 03:26:48,510
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

5273
03:26:48,830 --> 03:26:50,870
We were just about to leave.

5274
03:26:52,070 --> 03:26:54,370
You're quitting the challenge, bro.

5275
03:26:55,370 --> 03:26:58,070
Okay, this has gone long enough.

5276
03:26:58,890 --> 03:26:59,290
Luigi.

5277
03:26:59,730 --> 03:27:00,650
Come with us.

5278
03:27:00,930 --> 03:27:02,690
We're getting power stars.

5279
03:27:04,670 --> 03:27:05,730
Okay, then.

5280
03:27:06,750 --> 03:27:07,930
Oh my god, Luigi.

5281
03:27:08,250 --> 03:27:09,250
You're beta.

5282
03:27:10,110 --> 03:27:11,670
He's just like, okay.

5283
03:27:14,670 --> 03:27:15,310
Luigi.

5284
03:27:15,890 --> 03:27:17,690
You just let him pick you up like that.

5285
03:27:17,690 --> 03:27:19,710
This is why we don't have Year of Luigi anymore.

5286
03:27:20,310 --> 03:27:22,910
We don't have Year of Luigi because of you.

5287
03:27:27,190 --> 03:27:31,410
Okay, I'm gonna do two more encounters and see if I can get anything else.

5288
03:27:32,890 --> 03:27:35,190
Cause I know you guys said there's two more that I'm missing.

5289
03:27:36,710 --> 03:27:37,690
I'll do two more.

5290
03:27:40,210 --> 03:27:42,550
Oh, what the fuck is that?

5291
03:27:42,950 --> 03:27:44,110
It's a bird!

5292
03:27:44,850 --> 03:27:46,150
I'm gonna punch this bird.

5293
03:27:48,490 --> 03:27:51,170
My target was too heavy.

5294
03:27:52,950 --> 03:27:55,530
No, don't say that to Dad!

5295
03:27:56,230 --> 03:27:57,450
Yes, it's not his fault.

5296
03:27:57,470 --> 03:27:59,170
He's peeing out his protein.

5297
03:28:00,470 --> 03:28:02,430
It's not his fault.

5298
03:28:04,430 --> 03:28:05,150
Wow.

5299
03:28:09,940 --> 03:28:11,740
He's a big boy!

5300
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:13,180
He's a growing boy!

5301
03:28:14,080 --> 03:28:16,020
I can't believe it.

5302
03:28:16,900 --> 03:28:18,480
He fat shamed my dog.

5303
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:25,000
Alright, who wants to be Klepto?

5304
03:28:27,830 --> 03:28:28,900
The fat shamer.

5305
03:28:32,040 --> 03:28:34,170
That's just big bones!

5306
03:28:36,110 --> 03:28:36,970
Lord of Croesus.

5307
03:28:37,210 --> 03:28:38,010
Thank you for the super chat.

5308
03:28:38,110 --> 03:28:38,730
Thank you, thank you.

5309
03:28:38,770 --> 03:28:42,230
If you encounter a Rex or a T-Rex, can I be renamed from Goomba to that?

5310
03:28:42,370 --> 03:28:43,350
Lord of Croesus.

5311
03:28:44,190 --> 03:28:45,430
The Mon chose you.

5312
03:28:48,690 --> 03:28:50,050
You can't just...

5313
03:28:50,050 --> 03:28:52,430
You can't just revoke the Mon.

5314
03:28:52,930 --> 03:28:54,250
He picked you.

5315
03:28:56,750 --> 03:29:07,550
Annoying avian, an atrocious adversary, has a keen sense of valuable possession, will do anything to take it, because it has no value in itself!

5316
03:29:07,930 --> 03:29:09,450
Oh shit!

5317
03:29:11,950 --> 03:29:16,830
So, he has no self-esteem, or like, any confidence, whatsoever.

5318
03:29:17,270 --> 03:29:18,750
Who would like to be him?

5319
03:29:18,910 --> 03:29:22,330
He's just like me, for real, for real.

5320
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:23,810
Wait, Thunder...

5321
03:29:24,350 --> 03:29:26,610
Let's not have one yet, right?

5322
03:29:31,550 --> 03:29:32,150
Alright.

5323
03:29:32,330 --> 03:29:32,930
That's...

5324
03:29:32,930 --> 03:29:33,390
Me.

5325
03:29:35,590 --> 03:29:36,190
Alright.

5326
03:29:41,950 --> 03:29:44,370
Wait, I was joking.

5327
03:29:45,010 --> 03:29:46,230
Okay, alright.

5328
03:29:46,650 --> 03:29:47,110
You were...

5329
03:29:47,110 --> 03:29:48,310
Okay, I'll give it to Mel, then.

5330
03:29:49,190 --> 03:29:50,150
That's me!

5331
03:29:50,370 --> 03:29:50,910
Mel, alright.

5332
03:29:51,130 --> 03:29:51,970
Does Mel have...

5333
03:29:51,970 --> 03:29:53,230
I've named so many.

5334
03:29:53,450 --> 03:29:54,130
I'm, you know...

5335
03:29:54,130 --> 03:29:55,410
Does Mel have...

5336
03:29:55,410 --> 03:29:55,810
Uh...

5337
03:29:55,810 --> 03:29:57,070
Have a goon yet, or no?

5338
03:29:57,550 --> 03:30:01,070
I've named so many, I've already lost track of who I've named.

5339
03:30:01,570 --> 03:30:01,850
I...

5340
03:30:04,170 --> 03:30:05,210
No, alright.

5341
03:30:06,430 --> 03:30:06,990
Low se...

5342
03:30:06,990 --> 03:30:08,010
Mel is now...

5343
03:30:08,010 --> 03:30:09,450
Low self-esteem bird.

5344
03:30:10,810 --> 03:30:11,410
No...

5345
03:30:11,410 --> 03:30:13,950
But you choose to name me as the...

5346
03:30:13,950 --> 03:30:16,730
The goon chose you, Lord Korosis!

5347
03:30:17,410 --> 03:30:18,870
It picked you!

5348
03:30:27,190 --> 03:30:28,690
Now there's two more left?

5349
03:30:28,810 --> 03:30:29,050
Okay.

5350
03:30:29,430 --> 03:30:29,830
Okay.

5351
03:30:31,810 --> 03:30:32,870
Oh, I can't escape.

5352
03:30:36,030 --> 03:30:37,490
Abso, thank you for the super chat.

5353
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:38,210
Thank you, thank you.

5354
03:30:38,270 --> 03:30:40,290
He's just like me for real, for real.

5355
03:30:43,410 --> 03:30:44,570
Okay, I'll do...

5356
03:30:44,570 --> 03:30:45,350
I'll go...

5357
03:30:45,350 --> 03:30:46,930
I'll do like two more encounters again.

5358
03:30:47,150 --> 03:30:48,030
Cause I...

5359
03:30:48,030 --> 03:30:48,350
Oh!

5360
03:30:49,110 --> 03:30:50,310
It's the monkey!

5361
03:30:51,050 --> 03:30:53,130
It's the boss monkey!

5362
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:55,810
I'm punching it.

5363
03:30:56,990 --> 03:30:58,430
Oh my god.

5364
03:31:03,050 --> 03:31:03,960
I'm confused.

5365
03:31:07,190 --> 03:31:08,820
Okay, I hope I don't kill the monkey.

5366
03:31:10,980 --> 03:31:13,160
Guys, I accidentally killed the monkey.

5367
03:31:13,520 --> 03:31:13,960
I...

5368
03:31:18,100 --> 03:31:20,040
Guys, I accidentally...

5369
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:20,320
Whoop!

5370
03:31:22,860 --> 03:31:23,660
Um...

5371
03:31:23,660 --> 03:31:24,060
Whoop!

5372
03:31:24,520 --> 03:31:27,080
Guys, is the monkey a rare encounter?

5373
03:31:27,580 --> 03:31:30,020
Guys, is the monkey...

5374
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:35,240
Guys, is the monkey the rare encounter?

5375
03:31:36,620 --> 03:31:37,180
Because...

5376
03:31:37,180 --> 03:31:37,280
Because...

5377
03:31:37,280 --> 03:31:38,120
Oh...

5378
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:39,140
Oh no!

5379
03:31:39,260 --> 03:31:39,380
No!

5380
03:31:39,500 --> 03:31:40,360
We got another monkey!

5381
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:44,200
Alright, I'm punching it again.

5382
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:45,040
I'm...

5383
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:46,240
I'm punching...

5384
03:31:47,180 --> 03:31:48,080
Okay, fine!

5385
03:31:48,380 --> 03:31:49,500
Welcome to tomato farm.

5386
03:31:49,640 --> 03:31:50,300
Welcome, welcome.

5387
03:31:50,700 --> 03:31:51,300
This will...

5388
03:31:51,300 --> 03:31:52,180
It'll work this time.

5389
03:31:54,160 --> 03:31:54,900
Okay, there.

5390
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:55,180
See?

5391
03:31:55,220 --> 03:31:55,820
I told you.

5392
03:31:55,920 --> 03:31:56,880
It worked, guys.

5393
03:31:57,440 --> 03:31:59,180
Don't punch the monkey.

5394
03:31:59,700 --> 03:32:01,020
I'll punch it again.

5395
03:32:02,660 --> 03:32:03,220
Alright.

5396
03:32:09,320 --> 03:32:13,460
The next time you have a gaming membership, I want you to remember this.

5397
03:32:14,360 --> 03:32:16,080
Thank you for the super chat.

5398
03:32:16,360 --> 03:32:16,520
Gross.

5399
03:32:16,740 --> 03:32:17,740
Thank you, thank you.

5400
03:32:19,900 --> 03:32:22,120
A cute monkey that loves to play games.

5401
03:32:22,240 --> 03:32:25,260
It will often stay in trees and look for things to steal from people.

5402
03:32:25,640 --> 03:32:27,760
But with enough persistence, they'll give it back.

5403
03:32:27,980 --> 03:32:28,240
Alright.

5404
03:32:28,920 --> 03:32:30,080
Who wants to be the monkey?

5405
03:32:31,760 --> 03:32:33,280
I wish for monkey.

5406
03:32:33,520 --> 03:32:34,500
Alright, heathen.

5407
03:32:35,220 --> 03:32:36,720
You are the monkey.

5408
03:32:38,220 --> 03:32:39,440
Thank you for the super chat.

5409
03:32:39,580 --> 03:32:39,800
Thank you.

5410
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:40,600
Thank you.

5411
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:41,120
Thank you.

5412
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:41,600
I like...

5413
03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:43,520
The petition to be punched.

5414
03:32:43,780 --> 03:32:45,280
To be the punched monkey.

5415
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:46,160
Well, he's...

5416
03:32:46,160 --> 03:32:46,580
Which...

5417
03:32:46,580 --> 03:32:47,580
The one that died?

5418
03:32:51,480 --> 03:32:52,480
You mean...

5419
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:53,900
The one that killed?

5420
03:32:54,180 --> 03:32:55,820
Well, we can't get him back.

5421
03:32:56,400 --> 03:32:56,940
So...

5422
03:32:58,540 --> 03:32:59,080
Heathen.

5423
03:32:59,080 --> 03:32:59,180
Moon.

5424
03:33:00,040 --> 03:33:00,300
Alright.

5425
03:33:00,560 --> 03:33:01,480
There's one more, right?

5426
03:33:01,740 --> 03:33:03,160
There's one more encounter.

5427
03:33:04,040 --> 03:33:04,600
Left.

5428
03:33:04,900 --> 03:33:06,360
It's not his feeding time.

5429
03:33:06,460 --> 03:33:10,180
He wants to eat early because he tricked me into feeding him early this morning.

5430
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:12,020
He like...

5431
03:33:15,260 --> 03:33:16,760
I love this one!

5432
03:33:17,100 --> 03:33:18,060
I'm still punching it.

5433
03:33:19,760 --> 03:33:20,940
Oh my god!

5434
03:33:20,940 --> 03:33:21,860
It's Rex!

5435
03:33:21,860 --> 03:33:22,060
Rex!

5436
03:33:24,380 --> 03:33:25,660
I'm still punching it.

5437
03:33:28,240 --> 03:33:29,400
Please, please, please live.

5438
03:33:29,480 --> 03:33:29,920
Oh, thank god.

5439
03:33:30,100 --> 03:33:30,380
He lived.

5440
03:33:30,840 --> 03:33:31,380
Thank god.

5441
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:32,460
Yes!

5442
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:33,820
The Super Mario World!

5443
03:33:34,360 --> 03:33:36,640
What if there's already a goon with the same on?

5444
03:33:36,840 --> 03:33:37,140
Could they...

5445
03:33:37,140 --> 03:33:37,340
No.

5446
03:33:37,820 --> 03:33:38,220
Papa.

5447
03:33:38,980 --> 03:33:39,900
You were...

5448
03:33:39,900 --> 03:33:42,380
The goon chose you.

5449
03:33:45,320 --> 03:33:46,360
Oh my god!

5450
03:33:46,540 --> 03:33:46,560
Oh my god!

5451
03:33:46,560 --> 03:33:47,400
That was so scary!

5452
03:33:47,680 --> 03:33:48,880
Oh my god!

5453
03:33:49,380 --> 03:33:50,680
Okay, so...

5454
03:33:51,380 --> 03:33:54,800
So, basically, dad tricked me into...

5455
03:33:54,800 --> 03:33:55,860
What the fuck?

5456
03:33:57,300 --> 03:33:58,620
He squashed!

5457
03:33:59,240 --> 03:34:02,040
He tricked me into feeding him early.

5458
03:34:02,040 --> 03:34:04,240
Because he woke me up at 6.30.

5459
03:34:04,600 --> 03:34:06,720
And then I thought it was 8.

5460
03:34:06,720 --> 03:34:09,360
I didn't realize it was, like, super early.

5461
03:34:09,360 --> 03:34:11,740
So then, like...

5462
03:34:11,740 --> 03:34:12,480
Um...

5463
03:34:12,480 --> 03:34:13,260
So then I fed him.

5464
03:34:13,320 --> 03:34:14,380
And then I looked at the time.

5465
03:34:14,380 --> 03:34:15,520
It was 6.30 in the morning.

5466
03:34:15,680 --> 03:34:16,660
And I was like, you fucker.

5467
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:17,400
You...

5468
03:34:18,120 --> 03:34:18,920
So, like...

5469
03:34:18,920 --> 03:34:21,180
Technically, it is his squish time.

5470
03:34:21,780 --> 03:34:22,300
Not squish...

5471
03:34:22,300 --> 03:34:23,100
It is his feet.

5472
03:34:23,180 --> 03:34:23,360
Sorry.

5473
03:34:23,440 --> 03:34:23,940
Not squish...

5474
03:34:23,940 --> 03:34:25,340
I'm not squishing my dog.

5475
03:34:26,160 --> 03:34:26,560
Technically...

5476
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:27,240
Oh, he's egg.

5477
03:34:27,320 --> 03:34:28,400
Okay, I'm gonna give him a little snack.

5478
03:34:28,580 --> 03:34:30,160
I'm giving him a little snack, though.

5479
03:34:30,540 --> 03:34:31,200
I'll be right back.

5480
03:34:56,950 --> 03:34:58,050
I gave him...

5481
03:34:58,050 --> 03:34:59,670
I gave him a little snack.

5482
03:35:00,110 --> 03:35:01,270
To tide the hunger.

5483
03:35:01,690 --> 03:35:04,410
Because I don't want him to, like, fuck me up tomorrow.

5484
03:35:05,070 --> 03:35:05,470
I...

5485
03:35:07,990 --> 03:35:12,010
A flightless dragon, in light of its useless wings, adopts a charging attack.

5486
03:35:12,230 --> 03:35:15,470
When provoked, it compresses his body as a defense mechanism.

5487
03:35:18,310 --> 03:35:18,710
Um...

5488
03:35:19,270 --> 03:35:19,470
Alright.

5489
03:35:20,030 --> 03:35:20,430
Who...

5490
03:35:20,430 --> 03:35:20,710
Okay.

5491
03:35:22,350 --> 03:35:23,030
Ancestor Goon.

5492
03:35:23,130 --> 03:35:23,870
Goon Alpha.

5493
03:35:24,290 --> 03:35:24,690
Lollipop.

5494
03:35:24,730 --> 03:35:25,430
Thank you for the super chat.

5495
03:35:25,530 --> 03:35:25,750
Thank you.

5496
03:35:25,890 --> 03:35:26,270
Thank you.

5497
03:35:26,430 --> 03:35:29,170
Thank you.

5498
03:35:29,170 --> 03:35:30,470
Can I beat this?

5499
03:35:30,590 --> 03:35:31,030
Oh my god.

5500
03:35:31,170 --> 03:35:31,890
There's so many.

5501
03:35:32,190 --> 03:35:32,610
Alright, guys.

5502
03:35:32,830 --> 03:35:33,710
It's time to vote.

5503
03:35:36,470 --> 03:35:38,470
Has to be named after Rex.

5504
03:35:38,910 --> 03:35:39,310
Told no.

5505
03:35:39,470 --> 03:35:41,030
She immediately runs into...

5506
03:35:41,030 --> 03:35:41,710
Alright, guys.

5507
03:35:41,950 --> 03:35:44,710
Vote for the one you want to be named Rex.

5508
03:35:44,970 --> 03:35:46,670
He's a hot commodity.

5509
03:35:46,670 --> 03:35:47,330
Right now.

5510
03:35:47,330 --> 03:35:48,310
It's time to vote.

5511
03:35:48,310 --> 03:35:49,470
The super chat.

5512
03:35:49,670 --> 03:35:53,190
Vote for the super chat that you want to be named.

5513
03:35:58,150 --> 03:36:00,970
He's a hot commodity right now.

5514
03:36:01,230 --> 03:36:02,530
It's time to vote.

5515
03:36:03,570 --> 03:36:07,210
We will settle this with democracy.

5516
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:14,290
The super chat still exists.

5517
03:36:15,470 --> 03:36:18,370
We shall settle this with pure democracy.

5518
03:36:19,010 --> 03:36:20,010
Except for Kurosis.

5519
03:36:20,150 --> 03:36:21,050
No, he gets to...

5520
03:36:21,050 --> 03:36:21,790
No, Kuro...

5521
03:36:21,790 --> 03:36:23,690
We are not giving Kurosis.

5522
03:36:24,410 --> 03:36:25,950
The goon picked him.

5523
03:36:29,650 --> 03:36:31,010
Everything but...

5524
03:36:31,010 --> 03:36:32,850
Everyone but Kurosis.

5525
03:36:40,730 --> 03:36:41,070
Alright.

5526
03:36:42,230 --> 03:36:43,250
Let's see.

5527
03:36:43,770 --> 03:36:44,610
Oh wait.

5528
03:36:44,730 --> 03:36:45,930
I have to res...

5529
03:36:48,150 --> 03:36:49,270
Oh my god.

5530
03:36:49,470 --> 03:36:49,610
Wait.

5531
03:36:49,770 --> 03:36:51,270
My super chat bugged out.

5532
03:36:52,050 --> 03:36:55,410
Guys, I refreshed my thing and I lost some super chats.

5533
03:36:55,410 --> 03:36:56,070
Let's give me a sec.

5534
03:37:02,050 --> 03:37:03,090
Oh no.

5535
03:37:03,510 --> 03:37:03,870
Guys.

5536
03:37:04,170 --> 03:37:05,870
My super chat's bugged out.

5537
03:37:06,570 --> 03:37:07,290
Who won?

5538
03:37:08,070 --> 03:37:08,710
Thomas.

5539
03:37:08,950 --> 03:37:10,190
Thank you for the super chat.

5540
03:37:10,350 --> 03:37:11,150
Thank you.

5541
03:37:11,470 --> 03:37:12,150
I want...

5542
03:37:12,150 --> 03:37:12,650
I wish...

5543
03:37:12,650 --> 03:37:14,030
But no lying.

5544
03:37:14,510 --> 03:37:14,650
Okay.

5545
03:37:14,730 --> 03:37:16,390
I'm gonna do like a countdown though.

5546
03:37:17,090 --> 03:37:17,450
Five.

5547
03:37:18,010 --> 03:37:18,430
Four.

5548
03:37:19,590 --> 03:37:20,190
Three.

5549
03:37:20,970 --> 03:37:21,530
Two.

5550
03:37:22,350 --> 03:37:22,810
One.

5551
03:37:23,430 --> 03:37:23,770
Okay.

5552
03:37:24,090 --> 03:37:24,750
Let's see.

5553
03:37:25,410 --> 03:37:26,730
29 for Oni.

5554
03:37:29,110 --> 03:37:29,870
Alright.

5555
03:37:30,750 --> 03:37:32,870
29 is the number to beat.

5556
03:37:33,450 --> 03:37:33,570
Okay.

5557
03:37:33,730 --> 03:37:34,610
Oni got it.

5558
03:37:34,990 --> 03:37:35,750
I think.

5559
03:37:36,310 --> 03:37:36,490
Alright.

5560
03:37:36,930 --> 03:37:38,750
Congratulations, Oni.

5561
03:37:39,470 --> 03:37:43,450
No, Kurosis already got like fucking yeeted out of the polls.

5562
03:37:45,590 --> 03:37:47,230
Oni a goon.

5563
03:37:49,610 --> 03:37:51,390
Oh, thank you so much for the raid.

5564
03:37:51,650 --> 03:37:51,970
Thank you.

5565
03:37:52,150 --> 03:37:52,850
Thank you.

5566
03:37:53,890 --> 03:37:54,210
Thank you.

5567
03:37:54,210 --> 03:37:54,290
Alright.

5568
03:37:56,670 --> 03:37:57,150
Alright.

5569
03:37:57,230 --> 03:37:58,050
Now I can leave.

5570
03:37:59,410 --> 03:38:01,230
Oh, I should fix the goon cave.

5571
03:38:01,890 --> 03:38:04,110
Cause now it's like the non-goon cave.

5572
03:38:04,110 --> 03:38:07,110
Cause now it's like the non-gooners are in the goon cave and I don't like that.

5573
03:38:07,690 --> 03:38:08,010
Alright.

5574
03:38:09,050 --> 03:38:09,570
So...

5575
03:38:10,230 --> 03:38:10,550
Alright.

5576
03:38:10,690 --> 03:38:12,150
We'll put you guys right...

5577
03:38:12,150 --> 03:38:13,090
We'll put you here.

5578
03:38:16,390 --> 03:38:16,910
Okay.

5579
03:38:20,230 --> 03:38:20,990
Alright.

5580
03:38:23,690 --> 03:38:25,250
I see a pink shirt.

5581
03:38:26,250 --> 03:38:27,250
Oh, okay.

5582
03:38:27,910 --> 03:38:29,070
Put you guys here.

5583
03:38:29,970 --> 03:38:30,510
Alright.

5584
03:38:30,750 --> 03:38:32,170
What would box three be?

5585
03:38:34,210 --> 03:38:36,310
Box three will be...

5586
03:38:38,990 --> 03:38:39,750
Uh...

5587
03:38:39,750 --> 03:38:41,090
Box three...

5588
03:38:41,090 --> 03:38:42,490
What would box three be?

5589
03:38:42,790 --> 03:38:43,650
What's crag?

5590
03:38:44,810 --> 03:38:46,390
Where the fuck is crag?

5591
03:38:49,010 --> 03:38:49,770
Crag?

5592
03:38:50,170 --> 03:38:51,770
The fuck does crag mean?

5593
03:38:54,910 --> 03:38:55,290
Alright.

5594
03:38:56,090 --> 03:38:56,850
I don't know.

5595
03:38:57,070 --> 03:38:58,810
I don't know what to name box three.

5596
03:39:02,960 --> 03:39:04,080
Box three.

5597
03:39:04,080 --> 03:39:04,120
Box three.

5598
03:39:04,660 --> 03:39:05,120
Oh, it's...

5599
03:39:05,120 --> 03:39:05,740
Oh, there's...

5600
03:39:05,740 --> 03:39:06,520
It's rocks?

5601
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:07,940
Oh, that's what it means?

5602
03:39:08,180 --> 03:39:08,540
Oh!

5603
03:39:09,840 --> 03:39:10,540
Alright.

5604
03:39:14,080 --> 03:39:15,460
Name it...

5605
03:39:15,460 --> 03:39:15,820
Shame?

5606
03:39:16,640 --> 03:39:17,340
You...

5607
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:26,690
I know what to name it.

5608
03:39:32,900 --> 03:39:33,820
Right in the space?

5609
03:39:37,340 --> 03:39:38,040
Private...

5610
03:39:44,290 --> 03:39:44,850
Room.

5611
03:39:47,610 --> 03:39:48,730
I don't...

5612
03:39:48,730 --> 03:39:50,050
Wait, actually...

5613
03:39:52,370 --> 03:39:52,930
Private...

5614
03:39:57,460 --> 03:39:58,560
VIP room.

5615
03:39:59,940 --> 03:40:01,940
This is a VIP room.

5616
03:40:02,880 --> 03:40:03,440
Exclusive.

5617
03:40:06,300 --> 03:40:09,440
So then, if it's the private room...

5618
03:40:09,440 --> 03:40:09,860
Should be...

5619
03:40:09,860 --> 03:40:11,240
Oh, it should be on the beach.

5620
03:40:11,760 --> 03:40:12,140
Ooh.

5621
03:40:12,600 --> 03:40:13,980
Wait, no, but it's a room.

5622
03:40:13,980 --> 03:40:15,340
This should be in the city.

5623
03:40:15,820 --> 03:40:16,080
Ooh.

5624
03:40:16,580 --> 03:40:16,920
Ooh.

5625
03:40:17,120 --> 03:40:18,180
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

5626
03:40:23,400 --> 03:40:24,740
What goes on in there?

5627
03:40:24,880 --> 03:40:25,240
Nothing.

5628
03:40:26,140 --> 03:40:26,620
Nothing.

5629
03:40:26,800 --> 03:40:27,640
You gotta sign an NDA.

5630
03:40:29,820 --> 03:40:31,880
You always have to sign an NDA.

5631
03:40:33,320 --> 03:40:35,240
Let's go to the PC first.

5632
03:40:35,920 --> 03:40:36,440
just...

5633
03:40:37,940 --> 03:40:40,020
So we can heal everybody.

5634
03:40:47,700 --> 03:40:48,220
Alright.

5635
03:40:48,880 --> 03:40:50,820
Bum, bum, ba-da-da-da-dom.

5636
03:40:51,780 --> 03:40:54,500
Bum, bum, bum, ba-da-domp.

5637
03:40:57,740 --> 03:40:59,200
Alright, down I go.

5638
03:41:02,540 --> 03:41:07,400
Kay, already encountered all the mons so I don't have to worry anymore...

5639
03:41:07,400 --> 03:41:09,480
Oh, wait, is this Donkey Kong one?

5640
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:10,480
Oh!

5641
03:41:11,480 --> 03:41:12,500
Which version?

5642
03:41:13,140 --> 03:41:15,540
The Seth Rogen one or...

5643
03:41:18,440 --> 03:41:20,800
Which version of Donkey Kong is that?

5644
03:41:22,980 --> 03:41:25,060
Oh my god, I'm in Donkey Kong!

5645
03:41:27,110 --> 03:41:28,550
Ooh, ah, ee.

5646
03:41:30,090 --> 03:41:30,730
Mario!

5647
03:41:31,150 --> 03:41:31,730
Mario!

5648
03:41:32,730 --> 03:41:33,030
Oh.

5649
03:41:35,390 --> 03:41:35,970
Money!

5650
03:41:36,110 --> 03:41:37,550
Money running into you here!

5651
03:41:37,550 --> 03:41:38,750
It's me!

5652
03:41:39,010 --> 03:41:41,030
Captain Toad from Cloud Cap!

5653
03:41:42,570 --> 03:41:43,430
You seem stuck!

5654
03:41:43,790 --> 03:41:44,770
Is something wrong?

5655
03:41:45,610 --> 03:41:48,990
You can't understand the Kong Guard and they won't let you pass?

5656
03:41:49,670 --> 03:41:51,370
Maybe I can help with that.

5657
03:41:51,790 --> 03:41:53,870
I've been brushing up on my monkeys!

5658
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:57,570
Ooh, ah, ee, ee.

5659
03:41:58,070 --> 03:41:59,330
Ee, ee!

5660
03:42:02,540 --> 03:42:05,960
He says you need to defeat them in a wild battle!

5661
03:42:06,300 --> 03:42:07,720
To get an entry in the kingdom!

5662
03:42:11,120 --> 03:42:12,540
But don't you wait!

5663
03:42:12,980 --> 03:42:13,320
Me

5664
03:42:18,810 --> 03:42:19,590
and battle together!

5665
03:42:21,870 --> 03:42:22,510
Man!

5666
03:42:22,830 --> 03:42:24,370
This monkey is a strong!

5667
03:42:26,470 --> 03:42:28,830
You have one bond, Captain Toad?

5668
03:42:33,160 --> 03:42:34,000
It's okay.

5669
03:42:34,240 --> 03:42:35,300
I know what to do.

5670
03:42:35,300 --> 03:42:35,840
What?

5671
03:42:38,980 --> 03:42:39,760
Uh...

5672
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:40,600
You know...

5673
03:42:42,110 --> 03:42:43,400
You know what to do!

5674
03:42:45,130 --> 03:42:46,660
Okay, maybe we shouldn't.

5675
03:42:46,980 --> 03:42:47,680
Maybe...

5676
03:42:47,950 --> 03:42:49,610
Maybe we shouldn't fucking...

5677
03:42:51,500 --> 03:42:52,280
Explode!

5678
03:42:58,530 --> 03:42:59,310
Nice!

5679
03:42:59,610 --> 03:43:00,310
Goodbye, monkey!

5680
03:43:04,450 --> 03:43:06,390
Don't be rash there!

5681
03:43:06,950 --> 03:43:08,950
Well, calm down, Toadki!

5682
03:43:09,090 --> 03:43:09,690
Calm down!

5683
03:43:10,790 --> 03:43:12,650
You know what the heart wants!

5684
03:43:13,390 --> 03:43:14,570
I'll just chop him!

5685
03:43:15,710 --> 03:43:17,050
Chop the dino!

5686
03:43:17,370 --> 03:43:19,330
Make them extinct another time!

5687
03:43:23,020 --> 03:43:23,780
Oh, wait!

5688
03:43:23,860 --> 03:43:24,440
You can transform?

5689
03:43:24,760 --> 03:43:27,500
Why did you transform into fire?!

5690
03:43:27,500 --> 03:43:28,560
Oh, cause it's sunny!

5691
03:43:29,140 --> 03:43:29,540
Nevermind!

5692
03:43:29,660 --> 03:43:30,780
It's like a cascoon!

5693
03:43:31,780 --> 03:43:32,080
Absol!

5694
03:43:32,220 --> 03:43:32,980
Thank you for the super chat!

5695
03:43:33,100 --> 03:43:33,320
Thank you!

5696
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:33,840
Thank you!

5697
03:43:34,040 --> 03:43:39,820
Memories of me knocking out my rival's Pokemon because I wanted all the glory in the double battles!

5698
03:43:39,820 --> 03:43:41,680
Yeah, it's a cast form!

5699
03:43:43,340 --> 03:43:45,660
Yeah, I was gonna be like, Are you stupid?!

5700
03:43:45,660 --> 03:43:47,520
Why did you change the fire?!

5701
03:43:47,520 --> 03:43:48,720
And I realized you...

5702
03:43:48,720 --> 03:43:49,760
It wasn't a choice!

5703
03:43:51,340 --> 03:43:52,280
Oh, wait!

5704
03:43:52,840 --> 03:43:54,080
Dad has always been...

5705
03:43:57,340 --> 03:44:02,580
Does more damage if the user outweighs the foe!

5706
03:44:02,880 --> 03:44:03,480
Um...

5707
03:44:03,480 --> 03:44:04,260
Sorry, Dad!

5708
03:44:04,480 --> 03:44:05,560
You're a pretty head!

5709
03:44:10,860 --> 03:44:12,140
Better than...

5710
03:44:12,140 --> 03:44:12,580
Better than...

5711
03:44:12,580 --> 03:44:12,660
Okay!

5712
03:44:12,840 --> 03:44:15,780
I would say it's better than fire punch!

5713
03:44:16,220 --> 03:44:17,760
We might need it!

5714
03:44:18,180 --> 03:44:18,740
We...

5715
03:44:20,020 --> 03:44:20,660
Okay!

5716
03:44:21,180 --> 03:44:21,420
Alright!

5717
03:44:21,580 --> 03:44:23,220
Do we get rid of...

5718
03:44:23,220 --> 03:44:25,320
Fire punch or explosion?

5719
03:44:29,760 --> 03:44:31,140
I'm not calling!

5720
03:44:31,320 --> 03:44:33,820
I'm just calling him that he's heavier than the other...

5721
03:44:33,820 --> 03:44:34,480
Other...

5722
03:44:34,480 --> 03:44:36,200
Other dogs that get me!

5723
03:44:39,060 --> 03:44:39,700
Explosions!

5724
03:44:39,820 --> 03:44:40,720
Stays!

5725
03:44:41,680 --> 03:44:41,800
Okay!

5726
03:44:41,980 --> 03:44:42,380
You're right!

5727
03:44:42,580 --> 03:44:43,920
We get rid of fire punch!

5728
03:44:45,340 --> 03:44:46,680
You're so right, guys!

5729
03:44:50,980 --> 03:44:52,860
What if I need explosion?

5730
03:44:53,420 --> 03:44:54,800
You don't understand!

5731
03:44:55,380 --> 03:44:56,580
It'll come in handy!

5732
03:44:58,900 --> 03:44:58,960
Ah!

5733
03:44:59,220 --> 03:44:59,520
Ooh!

5734
03:44:59,800 --> 03:45:00,180
Ah!

5735
03:45:00,500 --> 03:45:00,720
E!

5736
03:45:00,900 --> 03:45:01,280
Ah!

5737
03:45:02,660 --> 03:45:04,140
Thank you for the super chat!

5738
03:45:04,300 --> 03:45:05,020
Thank you!

5739
03:45:05,120 --> 03:45:05,700
Hi, Toki!

5740
03:45:06,000 --> 03:45:06,460
First time donate!

5741
03:45:06,460 --> 03:45:06,540
Hey!

5742
03:45:06,640 --> 03:45:07,880
Thank you so much for the super chat!

5743
03:45:08,020 --> 03:45:09,820
We've been enjoying your time here!

5744
03:45:12,220 --> 03:45:12,500
Ooh!

5745
03:45:12,880 --> 03:45:13,220
Ooh!

5746
03:45:15,160 --> 03:45:16,140
Way to go!

5747
03:45:16,540 --> 03:45:18,040
The path is now open!

5748
03:45:18,740 --> 03:45:19,040
See!

5749
03:45:19,320 --> 03:45:21,680
It seems like you'll need a translator to keep going!

5750
03:45:21,980 --> 03:45:23,860
And potentially a battle partner!

5751
03:45:23,860 --> 03:45:25,170
I'll tag along!

5752
03:45:26,620 --> 03:45:28,860
I thought they could talk...

5753
03:45:28,860 --> 03:45:30,800
I thought they could talk...

5754
03:45:30,800 --> 03:45:30,920
I thought they could talk...

5755
03:45:30,920 --> 03:45:31,560
What do I...

5756
03:45:31,560 --> 03:45:32,000
Italian?

5757
03:45:32,620 --> 03:45:33,020
Woohoo!

5758
03:45:33,640 --> 03:45:36,140
Maya and Captain O take on the jungle kingdom!

5759
03:45:37,160 --> 03:45:38,860
Do they not speak Italian?

5760
03:45:38,860 --> 03:45:39,800
You...

5761
03:45:39,800 --> 03:45:40,380
You...

5762
03:45:40,380 --> 03:45:40,980
Ah!

5763
03:45:41,140 --> 03:45:41,740
Jump panel!

5764
03:45:42,140 --> 03:45:43,400
You may already know this!

5765
03:45:43,540 --> 03:45:44,460
But I can't jump!

5766
03:45:44,680 --> 03:45:46,240
Why are you following me?

5767
03:45:46,520 --> 03:45:48,080
I don't need a translator!

5768
03:45:48,660 --> 03:45:50,000
I'll beat them all up!

5769
03:45:51,360 --> 03:45:52,680
How about we split up?

5770
03:45:53,260 --> 03:45:57,420
I think we'll need to show off our individual skills to get through the jungle kingdom!

5771
03:45:58,120 --> 03:45:58,400
Alright!

5772
03:45:58,640 --> 03:45:59,400
Talk to me!

5773
03:45:59,620 --> 03:46:00,940
And ask me to go solo!

5774
03:46:01,880 --> 03:46:02,360
Hey!

5775
03:46:03,740 --> 03:46:04,340
Hey!

5776
03:46:04,340 --> 03:46:04,360
Okay.

5777
03:46:05,180 --> 03:46:06,100
Go solo.

5778
03:46:08,140 --> 03:46:11,240
You didn't press RF focus to camera me and move me around!

5779
03:46:11,420 --> 03:46:12,140
Try it out!

5780
03:46:12,440 --> 03:46:12,800
Hey!

5781
03:46:14,260 --> 03:46:17,580
What if I don't wanna press the RF button?

5782
03:46:19,080 --> 03:46:19,380
Woohoo!

5783
03:46:19,680 --> 03:46:20,640
I think we're ready!

5784
03:46:21,580 --> 03:46:22,140
Alright.

5785
03:46:22,500 --> 03:46:23,720
Let me talk to you.

5786
03:46:24,500 --> 03:46:25,960
I wanna steal your...

5787
03:46:25,960 --> 03:46:26,980
What do you have?

5788
03:46:30,350 --> 03:46:30,950
Oh!

5789
03:46:30,950 --> 03:46:31,070
Oh!

5790
03:46:33,390 --> 03:46:34,950
I can't just steal it.

5791
03:46:36,330 --> 03:46:38,550
I was gonna be like, show me your bag!

5792
03:46:41,030 --> 03:46:44,590
I may or may not have wanted to steal his stuff.

5793
03:46:48,330 --> 03:46:48,810
Okay.

5794
03:46:52,770 --> 03:46:53,970
Oh wait, I should save.

5795
03:46:55,130 --> 03:46:56,190
Wait, Toad?

5796
03:46:56,290 --> 03:46:56,870
Oh, that's me!

5797
03:46:57,010 --> 03:46:57,650
I'm Toad!

5798
03:46:58,110 --> 03:46:59,390
I was like, wait a minute.

5799
03:47:01,150 --> 03:47:02,570
I'll save real fast.

5800
03:47:03,720 --> 03:47:05,210
I showed you my bag.

5801
03:47:05,450 --> 03:47:06,210
Please respond.

5802
03:47:10,270 --> 03:47:12,150
I wanted to steal his stuff.

5803
03:47:13,970 --> 03:47:15,710
Oh, I have the power glove.

5804
03:47:16,030 --> 03:47:16,450
Oh!

5805
03:47:18,470 --> 03:47:19,990
We make a great team!

5806
03:47:20,230 --> 03:47:21,250
Let's press on!

5807
03:47:23,290 --> 03:47:23,910
Eh?

5808
03:47:31,500 --> 03:47:32,800
What do I do here?

5809
03:47:37,560 --> 03:47:38,040
Oh!

5810
03:47:38,240 --> 03:47:39,340
You want to move from here?

5811
03:47:39,520 --> 03:47:40,120
No way!

5812
03:47:40,460 --> 03:47:44,040
You don't even have an apartment to force me in a wild battle!

5813
03:47:45,440 --> 03:47:46,600
Okay, so...

5814
03:47:46,600 --> 03:47:47,540
I have to go here.

5815
03:47:50,380 --> 03:47:50,860
EEEE!

5816
03:47:50,920 --> 03:47:51,340
Oh, sorry.

5817
03:47:51,520 --> 03:47:52,580
Sorry, I went Toad.

5818
03:47:52,980 --> 03:47:53,160
E.

5819
03:47:53,420 --> 03:47:53,800
Ah.

5820
03:47:54,380 --> 03:47:54,540
Oh.

5821
03:47:55,660 --> 03:47:57,160
E-I-E-I-O.

5822
03:48:00,890 --> 03:48:02,950
By the way, any caps you catch with...

5823
03:48:02,950 --> 03:48:04,210
Are you fucking kidding me?

5824
03:48:04,470 --> 03:48:04,590
What?

5825
03:48:08,810 --> 03:48:10,010
That fucker...

5826
03:48:10,010 --> 03:48:10,690
Alright, it's time.

5827
03:48:10,910 --> 03:48:11,570
He crashed!

5828
03:48:13,110 --> 03:48:14,050
It's time!

5829
03:48:19,200 --> 03:48:20,020
That's right.

5830
03:48:20,300 --> 03:48:21,480
Crush that monkey!

5831
03:48:22,020 --> 03:48:22,520
Yes!

5832
03:48:26,960 --> 03:48:28,360
Crush the monkey!

5833
03:48:31,240 --> 03:48:32,680
That was strength zap.

5834
03:48:36,840 --> 03:48:40,040
Zaps the foes attack to heal them drops attack?

5835
03:48:40,860 --> 03:48:41,540
The fuck?

5836
03:48:43,020 --> 03:48:44,140
Eh, fuck it.

5837
03:48:44,260 --> 03:48:45,520
I don't think we need Tail Whip.

5838
03:48:46,340 --> 03:48:48,280
That monkey is dead!

5839
03:48:48,820 --> 03:48:49,840
Squish him!

5840
03:48:50,360 --> 03:48:52,260
You know like that crushed image where like...

5841
03:48:52,260 --> 03:48:53,280
It's like a butt imprint?

5842
03:48:53,900 --> 03:48:55,100
Flam butt imprint?

5843
03:48:58,780 --> 03:49:00,300
Okay, am I...

5844
03:49:00,300 --> 03:49:01,420
Is he heavier?

5845
03:49:02,160 --> 03:49:02,980
But we'll find out.

5846
03:49:10,870 --> 03:49:11,890
Alright, nice.

5847
03:49:12,510 --> 03:49:13,150
Oh shit!

5848
03:49:13,290 --> 03:49:14,010
It's pretty strong!

5849
03:49:16,750 --> 03:49:18,230
Wait, you fell down?!

5850
03:49:25,750 --> 03:49:27,510
Oh my god, get out of here.

5851
03:49:28,850 --> 03:49:29,210
Fly!

5852
03:49:30,650 --> 03:49:31,610
Crush him!

5853
03:49:35,440 --> 03:49:36,080
Yay!

5854
03:49:37,020 --> 03:49:38,560
Oh nice, sick bug leveled up.

5855
03:49:40,760 --> 03:49:40,940
Ooh.

5856
03:49:44,450 --> 03:49:45,070
Okay.

5857
03:49:46,250 --> 03:49:47,830
No, there's no boulders here.

5858
03:49:50,870 --> 03:49:52,510
Wait, where else can he go?

5859
03:49:54,790 --> 03:49:56,370
I can't go anywhere!

5860
03:49:58,070 --> 03:49:59,450
I have to wait here!

5861
03:50:02,590 --> 03:50:05,070
Okay, wait, let me move my...

5862
03:50:07,050 --> 03:50:07,320
Uh...

5863
03:50:08,030 --> 03:50:08,890
Actually, no.

5864
03:50:09,470 --> 03:50:10,670
We might have to keep him here.

5865
03:50:10,670 --> 03:50:13,030
Is there any new encounters in the tall grass?

5866
03:50:13,630 --> 03:50:14,070
Or...

5867
03:50:14,070 --> 03:50:14,670
Let's see.

5868
03:50:16,030 --> 03:50:17,610
I wanna see if there's new encounters.

5869
03:50:20,970 --> 03:50:22,470
Guys, you know there's new encounters?

5870
03:50:22,470 --> 03:50:23,030
Or no?

5871
03:50:23,750 --> 03:50:25,650
No, I'm not catching any of his toad.

5872
03:50:26,170 --> 03:50:27,030
He'll just have one.

5873
03:50:29,530 --> 03:50:32,110
Because apparently, he doesn't, like, go back...

5874
03:50:32,110 --> 03:50:34,190
Like, I don't get to keep the mods he captures, right?

5875
03:50:37,270 --> 03:50:38,250
Oh my god!

5876
03:50:38,310 --> 03:50:40,430
It's the little guy with the blanket!

5877
03:50:42,610 --> 03:50:45,030
Oh, I have to catch another to progress!

5878
03:50:45,430 --> 03:50:46,890
That's what he means!

5879
03:50:46,890 --> 03:50:47,910
Oh!

5880
03:50:48,590 --> 03:50:50,190
I'm gonna crush a bird!

5881
03:50:51,790 --> 03:50:52,850
That makes sense.

5882
03:50:52,930 --> 03:50:53,890
I was so confused.

5883
03:50:59,480 --> 03:51:00,500
I'm squishing...

5884
03:51:00,500 --> 03:51:00,960
Oh my god!

5885
03:51:01,140 --> 03:51:03,300
And he puts the sun out for me?!

5886
03:51:03,980 --> 03:51:04,260
Nice.

5887
03:51:08,910 --> 03:51:10,330
Bird pancake time.

5888
03:51:13,880 --> 03:51:14,740
Oh, return?

5889
03:51:14,940 --> 03:51:15,900
No, you're not learning that.

5890
03:51:17,420 --> 03:51:18,160
Bulk up.

5891
03:51:19,540 --> 03:51:20,320
What is that?

5892
03:51:20,480 --> 03:51:21,340
Is that...

5893
03:51:21,340 --> 03:51:22,000
Brown...

5894
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:22,480
Brass?

5895
03:51:26,820 --> 03:51:27,720
Can't tell.

5896
03:51:28,940 --> 03:51:30,900
I'm gonna fucking crush it.

5897
03:51:31,680 --> 03:51:32,800
I'll just air slash it.

5898
03:51:33,340 --> 03:51:34,660
Oh, it's grass fighting?

5899
03:51:35,020 --> 03:51:36,120
Oh, wait, that's good!

5900
03:51:37,520 --> 03:51:38,040
Yay!

5901
03:51:49,860 --> 03:51:50,540
Momento.

5902
03:51:51,600 --> 03:51:52,280
No.

5903
03:51:56,360 --> 03:51:57,660
Get out of here!

5904
03:51:58,880 --> 03:52:00,060
Oh, wait, you're right!

5905
03:52:01,800 --> 03:52:04,420
You are named after professors.

5906
03:52:05,190 --> 03:52:06,340
I just noticed that.

5907
03:52:06,500 --> 03:52:07,340
His name is Juniper.

5908
03:52:09,380 --> 03:52:10,480
That's clever!

5909
03:52:13,280 --> 03:52:14,380
Is there anything here?

5910
03:52:14,620 --> 03:52:15,280
No, there isn't.

5911
03:52:18,640 --> 03:52:19,300
Alright.

5912
03:52:19,920 --> 03:52:22,080
I have to catch a Mon for Toad.

5913
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:24,060
Alright, Toad.

5914
03:52:24,570 --> 03:52:25,360
Catch something.

5915
03:52:26,060 --> 03:52:27,440
We need one more.

5916
03:52:27,980 --> 03:52:29,880
We need one more.

5917
03:52:30,280 --> 03:52:30,940
Alright.

5918
03:52:31,200 --> 03:52:31,780
Good enough.

5919
03:52:32,580 --> 03:52:33,640
Good enough.

5920
03:52:36,300 --> 03:52:37,640
What the fuck?

5921
03:52:37,840 --> 03:52:38,800
What's Snowscape?

5922
03:52:39,240 --> 03:52:40,520
I should have read.

5923
03:52:40,720 --> 03:52:42,620
I should have read his moves.

5924
03:52:44,160 --> 03:52:46,320
Alright, throw the hammer at this bird!

5925
03:52:47,140 --> 03:52:48,120
Oh my god.

5926
03:52:49,920 --> 03:52:51,460
He's so weak.

5927
03:52:54,520 --> 03:52:55,160
So...

5928
03:52:59,070 --> 03:53:01,070
Alright, I assume that like...

5929
03:53:01,810 --> 03:53:03,510
I get like...

5930
03:53:04,370 --> 03:53:07,290
I assume I get like other stuff, right?

5931
03:53:07,310 --> 03:53:09,070
Like when I use the...

5932
03:53:09,650 --> 03:53:16,650
Yeah, if I use like the weather moves, I assume like when I change, it gets stronger in weather.

5933
03:53:33,860 --> 03:53:36,220
Alright, one of you guys can rename yourself.

5934
03:53:42,560 --> 03:53:46,380
One of you guys can rename yourself the Fitback Goon.

5935
03:53:46,380 --> 03:53:47,200
And...

5936
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:52,980
Oh my god.

5937
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:54,880
Guys, I don't think we're gonna win this one.

5938
03:53:55,280 --> 03:53:55,660
I...

5939
03:53:58,420 --> 03:53:59,780
Okay, we'll use Rain Dance.

5940
03:54:02,440 --> 03:54:02,880
Wait.

5941
03:54:03,160 --> 03:54:04,180
I might be able to pick him up.

5942
03:54:04,400 --> 03:54:05,340
Can't be that heavy.

5943
03:54:06,720 --> 03:54:10,560
No, I can't use fire because the Dino will just like absorb it.

5944
03:54:14,090 --> 03:54:14,530
No!

5945
03:54:14,750 --> 03:54:15,430
Oh wait, I did it!

5946
03:54:15,430 --> 03:54:16,570
I took you up in the air!

5947
03:54:19,670 --> 03:54:21,330
I knew you weren't that heavy.

5948
03:54:27,600 --> 03:54:29,520
Okay, so now I have a Boomerang.

5949
03:54:30,440 --> 03:54:32,660
Wait, why is my Boomerang flying?

5950
03:54:36,690 --> 03:54:37,530
Oh, nice!

5951
03:54:41,620 --> 03:54:42,860
Oh, it's so strong!

5952
03:54:43,300 --> 03:54:43,860
Okay, good.

5953
03:54:44,020 --> 03:54:44,600
Okay, I...

5954
03:54:44,600 --> 03:54:45,300
I'm gonna...

5955
03:54:45,300 --> 03:54:46,440
That's actually really good.

5956
03:54:46,440 --> 03:54:48,060
I kidnapped you.

5957
03:54:55,110 --> 03:54:56,270
Nice, I crit it.

5958
03:54:57,470 --> 03:54:58,350
Okay, Boomerang.

5959
03:54:58,670 --> 03:54:59,530
Sky drop.

5960
03:55:01,490 --> 03:55:02,970
I'll take you up in the air.

5961
03:55:04,250 --> 03:55:04,950
It's alright.

5962
03:55:08,010 --> 03:55:09,250
Yeah, that was crazy.

5963
03:55:10,230 --> 03:55:11,550
Okay, that should kill him.

5964
03:55:12,270 --> 03:55:12,790
Right?

5965
03:55:13,030 --> 03:55:13,670
Yeah, it should.

5966
03:55:14,510 --> 03:55:16,970
He's literally like falling from the fucking sky.

5967
03:55:17,190 --> 03:55:18,610
It should kill him from impact alone.

5968
03:55:21,970 --> 03:55:23,530
On Wild Battles, bud.

5969
03:55:23,790 --> 03:55:24,770
Here, have these!

5970
03:55:25,130 --> 03:55:25,570
Oh, nice!

5971
03:55:27,070 --> 03:55:28,870
Just doing it for the sake of it.

5972
03:55:31,090 --> 03:55:31,230
Okay.

5973
03:55:34,610 --> 03:55:35,650
And then...

5974
03:55:37,410 --> 03:55:38,190
There you go.

5975
03:55:39,530 --> 03:55:41,090
So that should open...

5976
03:55:41,090 --> 03:55:42,810
Yeah, that should open the gates then.

5977
03:55:43,530 --> 03:55:43,830
Yay!

5978
03:55:46,130 --> 03:55:47,110
So what's this?

5979
03:55:50,760 --> 03:55:52,760
Oh, I can go down the waterfall?

5980
03:55:53,260 --> 03:55:55,640
Oh my god, not the stupid stick bug.

5981
03:55:58,520 --> 03:56:00,220
Stupid fucking stick bug.

5982
03:56:03,200 --> 03:56:06,080
Okay, I wanna grab that item before I go down the waterfall.

5983
03:56:13,060 --> 03:56:14,100
Okay, thank god I looked.

5984
03:56:15,520 --> 03:56:16,940
Con... Covert cloak.

5985
03:56:17,940 --> 03:56:19,400
Alright, down I go.

5986
03:56:20,780 --> 03:56:21,320
Yay!

5987
03:56:21,960 --> 03:56:22,780
Oh, there he is!

5988
03:56:24,760 --> 03:56:25,680
Yes!

5989
03:56:26,700 --> 03:56:27,620
Okay.

5990
03:56:27,980 --> 03:56:28,560
We're catching.

5991
03:56:31,860 --> 03:56:32,880
Oh my god.

5992
03:56:35,000 --> 03:56:36,820
There it is.

5993
03:56:38,860 --> 03:56:40,160
There it is.

5994
03:56:40,160 --> 03:56:42,260
There he is.

5995
03:56:42,740 --> 03:56:43,380
There he is.

5996
03:56:44,920 --> 03:56:46,640
He has returned.

5997
03:56:48,360 --> 03:56:49,920
I'm too...

5998
03:56:49,920 --> 03:56:52,040
Perfect for the goon.

5999
03:56:54,860 --> 03:56:57,520
That yes came from the heart.

6000
03:56:58,620 --> 03:56:58,920
No!

6001
03:57:03,210 --> 03:57:06,410
Yes, I'm too lazy to evolve cheap right now.

6002
03:57:07,290 --> 03:57:08,630
Okay, we'll put Husky...

6003
03:57:10,250 --> 03:57:11,330
Goon in here.

6004
03:57:11,530 --> 03:57:12,670
So he can stun him.

6005
03:57:16,570 --> 03:57:17,790
If he lives.

6006
03:57:18,430 --> 03:57:19,150
He lives.

6007
03:57:19,310 --> 03:57:19,450
Okay.

6008
03:57:19,810 --> 03:57:20,950
And then we'll stun Spore.

6009
03:57:31,880 --> 03:57:32,520
Alright.

6010
03:57:32,860 --> 03:57:33,760
And then...

6011
03:57:33,760 --> 03:57:34,520
Whip him!

6012
03:57:34,820 --> 03:57:35,220
Yes!

6013
03:57:38,860 --> 03:57:39,900
Whip him!

6014
03:57:41,460 --> 03:57:42,220
I'll just...

6015
03:57:42,220 --> 03:57:42,580
I'll just...

6016
03:57:42,580 --> 03:57:43,720
Use stun Spore to like...

6017
03:57:43,720 --> 03:57:44,580
As a throwaway move.

6018
03:57:48,740 --> 03:57:49,300
Alright.

6019
03:57:49,480 --> 03:57:50,220
Baseball cat.

6020
03:57:52,280 --> 03:57:52,840
Yay!

6021
03:57:57,290 --> 03:57:58,570
Cheap chomp was caught!

6022
03:58:01,430 --> 03:58:01,990
Alright.

6023
03:58:02,250 --> 03:58:03,410
Who wants to be him?

6024
03:58:03,850 --> 03:58:04,790
You know where what...

6025
03:58:04,790 --> 03:58:06,770
You know what box you're going into though.

6026
03:58:06,770 --> 03:58:07,510
Just...

6027
03:58:11,570 --> 03:58:13,270
A bigger-lipped fish.

6028
03:58:13,590 --> 03:58:15,630
It's appetite is unmatched.

6029
03:58:18,290 --> 03:58:22,230
It prowls shallow waters and swallows its prey whole.

6030
03:58:22,430 --> 03:58:22,690
Whoa!

6031
03:58:23,110 --> 03:58:25,370
It is the subject of rumors and ghost stories.

6032
03:58:27,290 --> 03:58:28,570
Oh, apparition?

6033
03:58:28,930 --> 03:58:29,090
Wait.

6034
03:58:29,250 --> 03:58:29,570
Ipu.

6035
03:58:30,330 --> 03:58:32,650
Has Ipu been named yet or no?

6036
03:58:32,950 --> 03:58:33,090
Wait.

6037
03:58:33,330 --> 03:58:34,930
Didn't Delta want it to be named?

6038
03:58:34,930 --> 03:58:35,150
Wait.

6039
03:58:35,270 --> 03:58:35,630
Actually.

6040
03:58:36,170 --> 03:58:38,610
I heard that Del Delta has been like...

6041
03:58:38,610 --> 03:58:40,470
Asking to be named for a long time.

6042
03:58:43,450 --> 03:58:44,090
Del...

6043
03:58:45,650 --> 03:58:46,430
Here you go.

6044
03:58:50,510 --> 03:58:51,790
You asked...

6045
03:58:51,790 --> 03:58:53,610
And you received it.

6046
03:59:01,100 --> 03:59:02,540
Put me in that box.

6047
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:06,060
Thank you for the secret chat.

6048
03:59:06,260 --> 03:59:06,660
Thank you.

6049
03:59:06,880 --> 03:59:07,400
Thank you.

6050
03:59:09,360 --> 03:59:10,510
I got bamboozled.

6051
03:59:11,240 --> 03:59:11,520
Don't worry.

6052
03:59:11,620 --> 03:59:12,560
I'll find another one.

6053
03:59:13,540 --> 03:59:14,120
Oh.

6054
03:59:14,420 --> 03:59:15,680
Is that what you really wanted?

6055
03:59:16,320 --> 03:59:16,740
Is...

6056
03:59:17,330 --> 03:59:19,640
I can find another one for you, Ipu.

6057
03:59:23,860 --> 03:59:26,060
The monkey paw girl.

6058
03:59:29,400 --> 03:59:30,180
Don't worry.

6059
03:59:30,260 --> 03:59:31,440
I got you, bro.

6060
03:59:31,440 --> 03:59:32,620
Is that...

6061
03:59:32,620 --> 03:59:32,760
I...

6062
03:59:32,760 --> 03:59:35,440
I did not realize you were so passionate about...

6063
03:59:37,960 --> 03:59:38,960
Don't worry.

6064
03:59:39,320 --> 03:59:41,840
We needed more of these guys anyway.

6065
03:59:45,140 --> 03:59:48,340
Put them together alone in a box.

6066
03:59:48,920 --> 03:59:50,760
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

6067
03:59:50,900 --> 03:59:51,200
Thank you.

6068
03:59:51,400 --> 03:59:51,980
Thank you.

6069
03:59:52,560 --> 03:59:53,620
Oh my god.

6070
03:59:53,840 --> 03:59:56,820
It's all the fucking stupid stick bugs.

6071
04:00:03,440 --> 04:00:04,060
All right.

6072
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:04,780
Let's see.

6073
04:00:05,580 --> 04:00:06,160
All right.

6074
04:00:06,180 --> 04:00:07,160
I'll do two more encounters.

6075
04:00:07,320 --> 04:00:08,340
If we don't get him...

6076
04:00:08,340 --> 04:00:09,380
We'll find another...

6077
04:00:09,380 --> 04:00:11,040
We'll find him again in another day.

6078
04:00:11,120 --> 04:00:11,280
Oh.

6079
04:00:11,400 --> 04:00:11,860
No worries.

6080
04:00:12,220 --> 04:00:12,520
Don't worry.

6081
04:00:12,620 --> 04:00:13,800
The game was like...

6082
04:00:13,800 --> 04:00:14,160
No.

6083
04:00:14,460 --> 04:00:15,440
We really...

6084
04:00:20,320 --> 04:00:20,800
Wait.

6085
04:00:20,800 --> 04:00:21,140
Wait.

6086
04:00:21,320 --> 04:00:21,460
Wait.

6087
04:00:21,460 --> 04:00:21,720
Wait.

6088
04:00:21,920 --> 04:00:22,680
I got this.

6089
04:00:23,280 --> 04:00:23,480
Wait.

6090
04:00:26,560 --> 04:00:27,040
Wait.

6091
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:27,100
Wait.

6092
04:00:27,260 --> 04:00:27,700
Don't leave.

6093
04:00:40,390 --> 04:00:41,010
All right.

6094
04:00:41,150 --> 04:00:41,430
Nice.

6095
04:00:41,830 --> 04:00:42,930
You thought I'd kill that.

6096
04:00:43,030 --> 04:00:44,410
You were hoping he died.

6097
04:00:51,810 --> 04:00:52,770
You were...

6098
04:00:57,180 --> 04:00:58,020
All right.

6099
04:01:03,000 --> 04:01:03,560
All right.

6100
04:01:03,560 --> 04:01:04,200
Stun spore.

6101
04:01:07,550 --> 04:01:08,330
All right.

6102
04:01:09,330 --> 04:01:09,950
Don't worry.

6103
04:01:10,070 --> 04:01:11,090
I got you, Ippu.

6104
04:01:11,470 --> 04:01:12,670
That's what you wanted, right?

6105
04:01:12,930 --> 04:01:13,770
I got you.

6106
04:01:15,190 --> 04:01:15,750
See?

6107
04:01:15,890 --> 04:01:17,210
I didn't bamboozle you.

6108
04:01:17,530 --> 04:01:19,210
You asked and you received.

6109
04:01:19,970 --> 04:01:24,150
Ha ha ha ha,ha ha ha ha!

6110
04:01:24,830 --> 04:01:25,050
Yeahh,

6111
04:01:30,030 --> 04:01:30,030
thank you.

6112
04:01:30,730 --> 04:01:31,210
Good.

6113
04:01:33,470 --> 04:01:33,710
No.

6114
04:01:33,910 --> 04:01:34,450
Bloody crisis.

6115
04:01:34,810 --> 04:01:36,550
Thank you in the super chat, thank you.

6116
04:01:36,730 --> 04:01:37,050
Thank you.

6117
04:01:37,050 --> 04:01:37,130
Thank you.

6118
04:01:37,530 --> 04:01:39,410
Oh you're not going to the exile box.

6119
04:01:39,610 --> 04:01:41,010
I'm not letting you off that easy.

6120
04:01:46,360 --> 04:01:47,040
All right.

6121
04:01:48,440 --> 04:01:48,920
Actually...

6122
04:01:48,920 --> 04:01:50,440
That's where Dell would go.

6123
04:01:50,440 --> 04:01:56,640
Oh, and then... Where's... Where's Kuro... Okay.

6124
04:02:00,850 --> 04:02:01,870
There we go.

6125
04:02:04,310 --> 04:02:05,410
Have fun.

6126
04:02:13,870 --> 04:02:14,810
There we go.

6127
04:02:15,090 --> 04:02:15,430
Perfect.

6128
04:02:29,810 --> 04:02:30,250
Alright.

6129
04:02:30,890 --> 04:02:32,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6130
04:02:38,630 --> 04:02:39,250
Oh, wait.

6131
04:02:39,370 --> 04:02:39,750
What the fuck?

6132
04:02:39,770 --> 04:02:40,470
He kicked me out.

6133
04:02:45,560 --> 04:02:46,000
Alright.

6134
04:02:50,750 --> 04:02:57,140
I have to, like, physically move Toad over?

6135
04:02:57,320 --> 04:02:58,020
That's so dumb.

6136
04:02:59,100 --> 04:03:00,360
Like, he's right there!

6137
04:03:01,280 --> 04:03:04,520
Can't let you in town unless you defeat us in a 2v2.

6138
04:03:04,520 --> 04:03:06,100
I'm trying!

6139
04:03:10,520 --> 04:03:11,880
What?

6140
04:03:19,270 --> 04:03:21,350
Oh, with Mario.

6141
04:03:21,830 --> 04:03:22,110
Okay.

6142
04:03:24,130 --> 04:03:25,490
What?

6143
04:03:26,130 --> 04:03:28,290
Oh, I have to talk to Toad.

6144
04:03:28,470 --> 04:03:28,710
Okay.

6145
04:03:32,270 --> 04:03:32,950
Stupid.

6146
04:03:36,570 --> 04:03:37,910
That should be super!

6147
04:03:38,250 --> 04:03:41,230
There shouldn't be anything left in our way to a jungle village!

6148
04:03:41,550 --> 04:03:42,230
Okay, go together.

6149
04:03:42,470 --> 04:03:42,610
Alright.

6150
04:03:42,850 --> 04:03:43,490
Come over here.

6151
04:03:45,350 --> 04:03:48,790
He says he won't let you in town unless we defeat him in a wild battle!

6152
04:03:49,010 --> 04:03:49,570
Yeah, we're ready.

6153
04:03:49,570 --> 04:03:49,590
Okay.

6154
04:03:50,130 --> 04:03:52,310
I was like, he's- You're right here!

6155
04:03:52,530 --> 04:03:58,770
I don't have- I shouldn't be forced to, like, fucking- Talk to Toad to activate this.

6156
04:04:04,600 --> 04:04:05,160
Alright.

6157
04:04:06,080 --> 04:04:09,800
I must be- Dad must be heavier.

6158
04:04:10,140 --> 04:04:10,720
Must be heavier.

6159
04:04:11,000 --> 04:04:12,280
What if I just squish him?

6160
04:04:16,840 --> 04:04:19,580
I- I just go and squish my own teammate.

6161
04:04:24,310 --> 04:04:24,670
Zero!

6162
04:04:25,310 --> 04:04:26,670
Chris, thank you for the super chat!

6163
04:04:26,810 --> 04:04:27,770
Thank you- Thank you!

6164
04:04:28,030 --> 04:04:28,490
There we go.

6165
04:04:28,590 --> 04:04:29,110
I knew it.

6166
04:04:30,290 --> 04:04:31,530
Yeah, I'm not gonna crit him.

6167
04:04:35,500 --> 04:04:38,640
I was like, he better- He's like the fucking king of the bombs!

6168
04:04:44,770 --> 04:04:46,490
The sunlight is so strong!

6169
04:04:48,670 --> 04:04:49,850
Oh, wait, they have two?

6170
04:04:50,190 --> 04:04:50,910
Wait, that's cheating!

6171
04:04:51,510 --> 04:04:52,510
Oh, it's the fish bone.

6172
04:04:53,630 --> 04:04:55,410
I don't think I can crush him, so I'll just throw him.

6173
04:04:57,890 --> 04:04:58,570
What the fuck?

6174
04:04:58,830 --> 04:04:59,530
What'd he do?

6175
04:05:00,990 --> 04:05:01,550
Oh, wait.

6176
04:05:01,710 --> 04:05:05,350
Oh, yeah, cause he's- Why- Why did you use fire on him?!

6177
04:05:08,250 --> 04:05:10,670
Oh, wait, it's- No, he just has several moves.

6178
04:05:10,850 --> 04:05:11,710
Jesus Christ!

6179
04:05:14,630 --> 04:05:15,250
Oh!

6180
04:05:15,570 --> 04:05:16,950
Fuck, I forgot he's a ghost.

6181
04:05:19,490 --> 04:05:20,370
I forgot.

6182
04:05:23,030 --> 04:05:24,390
Oh, that's awkward.

6183
04:05:36,140 --> 04:05:37,580
Alright, snow time.

6184
04:05:41,460 --> 04:05:43,360
Oh, now he's an ice bro!

6185
04:05:47,200 --> 04:05:48,320
Oh, Jesus.

6186
04:05:48,980 --> 04:05:50,100
That's so strong.

6187
04:05:50,840 --> 04:05:52,200
Wait, is this the hill?

6188
04:05:52,920 --> 04:05:54,320
No, it doesn't do hill damage.

6189
04:05:56,700 --> 04:05:58,780
Okay, I literally just need to hit one of them.

6190
04:06:03,460 --> 04:06:04,420
Alright, that's fine.

6191
04:06:04,860 --> 04:06:07,140
That barely does any- Okay, that does a lot.

6192
04:06:07,500 --> 04:06:08,180
Never mind.

6193
04:06:08,380 --> 04:06:10,440
Why did you change your moveset?!

6194
04:06:13,560 --> 04:06:14,620
Toad, please!

6195
04:06:17,640 --> 04:06:18,780
Please!

6196
04:06:18,780 --> 04:06:19,560
Toad!

6197
04:06:23,540 --> 04:06:25,340
Oh my god.

6198
04:06:29,430 --> 04:06:31,140
Please, Toad!

6199
04:06:36,170 --> 04:06:38,450
Jesus Christ, Toad.

6200
04:06:39,010 --> 04:06:39,930
You fucker.

6201
04:06:42,210 --> 04:06:47,050
I literally just needed you- I literally just needed you- Oh, what if- Am I- Am I like- Stronger?

6202
04:06:47,210 --> 04:06:49,970
Am I heavier than- Than chain chomp?

6203
04:06:50,110 --> 04:06:50,690
Let's find out.

6204
04:06:50,690 --> 04:06:50,790
Toad.

6205
04:06:50,790 --> 04:06:52,090
I swear to god.

6206
04:06:52,310 --> 04:06:52,550
Toad.

6207
04:06:53,050 --> 04:06:53,210
Please.

6208
04:06:54,350 --> 04:06:54,910
Please.

6209
04:06:55,750 --> 04:06:56,130
Toad.

6210
04:06:56,330 --> 04:06:58,850
I- I swear to god.

6211
04:06:59,770 --> 04:07:00,330
Toad!

6212
04:07:00,470 --> 04:07:03,030
I expected you to- Oh my god.

6213
04:07:03,110 --> 04:07:03,630
I'm sorry.

6214
04:07:03,790 --> 04:07:04,630
I'm mad too!

6215
04:07:05,210 --> 04:07:06,510
I'm mad too!

6216
04:07:08,730 --> 04:07:09,810
Toad!

6217
04:07:09,810 --> 04:07:11,310
Wait thirty more minutes!

6218
04:07:12,790 --> 04:07:14,950
I'm also mad!

6219
04:07:18,670 --> 04:07:20,830
Toad, why?!

6220
04:07:23,190 --> 04:07:24,870
Oh my god.

6221
04:07:25,010 --> 04:07:26,670
Toad has like fuck- Toad!

6222
04:07:26,870 --> 04:07:27,170
Please!

6223
04:07:28,370 --> 04:07:31,670
I need to hit one person!

6224
04:07:35,990 --> 04:07:36,530
What?

6225
04:07:36,530 --> 04:07:37,070
Why?

6226
04:07:37,110 --> 04:07:37,550
Why?

6227
04:07:37,650 --> 04:07:37,650
Why?

6228
04:07:37,790 --> 04:07:37,790
Why?

6229
04:07:37,890 --> 04:07:37,890
Why?

6230
04:07:38,310 --> 04:07:38,570
No.

6231
04:07:39,230 --> 04:07:40,110
Okay, do we feed him early?

6232
04:07:40,630 --> 04:07:41,970
Do I give in, guys?

6233
04:07:42,330 --> 04:07:43,070
Do we give in?

6234
04:07:44,530 --> 04:07:46,250
He's not asking.

6235
04:07:47,110 --> 04:07:47,470
Why?

6236
04:07:47,670 --> 04:07:52,810
It's because he... It's because he tricked me and made... He tricked me into feeding him early.

6237
04:07:52,810 --> 04:07:54,570
And now he is mad.

6238
04:07:55,310 --> 04:07:56,370
And now... No.

6239
04:07:58,030 --> 04:07:58,910
Don't give in.

6240
04:07:59,090 --> 04:07:59,650
Okay, we wait.

6241
04:07:59,790 --> 04:08:00,430
We just need to wait.

6242
04:08:00,530 --> 04:08:02,670
We literally need to wait 30 more minutes.

6243
04:08:03,010 --> 04:08:04,070
Oh my god.

6244
04:08:04,170 --> 04:08:06,350
We need to wait 30 more minutes.

6245
04:08:08,790 --> 04:08:10,110
Yeah, I'm closing the door.

6246
04:08:14,620 --> 04:08:15,560
I'm confused.

6247
04:08:15,920 --> 04:08:18,340
He was like, you closed the door?

6248
04:08:19,260 --> 04:08:22,660
He said he didn't think he was a super chap that he made.

6249
04:08:26,700 --> 04:08:27,220
Alright.

6250
04:08:27,220 --> 04:08:27,740
Nice.

6251
04:08:31,100 --> 04:08:32,440
What the fuck is that?

6252
04:08:34,040 --> 04:08:35,760
Oh, and Takti does more of him.

6253
04:08:35,920 --> 04:08:37,320
Yeah, nobody's gonna be fainting.

6254
04:08:46,680 --> 04:08:48,260
We did it, Mario!

6255
04:08:48,760 --> 04:08:49,840
We said we'd go in!

6256
04:08:50,520 --> 04:08:51,000
Nice.

6257
04:08:52,700 --> 04:08:53,560
What's going on?

6258
04:08:57,930 --> 04:08:58,910
Bowser, bro.

6259
04:08:59,250 --> 04:09:04,270
I'm shocked you've gotten four power stars without knowing how to properly utilize items.

6260
04:09:04,590 --> 04:09:05,270
Wait, that's me!

6261
04:09:05,910 --> 04:09:06,630
Yeah, yeah.

6262
04:09:08,770 --> 04:09:09,890
Hey, Luigi.

6263
04:09:10,250 --> 04:09:13,930
Can you please explain in excruciating detail what every item does?

6264
04:09:14,310 --> 04:09:15,410
Certainly, bro!

6265
04:09:16,230 --> 04:09:19,930
Mushrooms are healing items that you can use in the middle of battle.

6266
04:09:20,310 --> 04:09:23,890
There are different varieties that restore different amounts of health.

6267
04:09:24,570 --> 04:09:26,410
Have you located the golden banana?

6268
04:09:27,250 --> 04:09:28,570
Yes, my sneeziness.

6269
04:09:28,870 --> 04:09:30,670
They're as deep in the safari zone.

6270
04:09:32,190 --> 04:09:33,790
He is a min-maxer.

6271
04:09:33,890 --> 04:09:34,410
He is.

6272
04:09:34,710 --> 04:09:36,950
I bet he IV trains, too.

6273
04:09:37,530 --> 04:09:37,890
Perfect.

6274
04:09:38,230 --> 04:09:41,110
Start mobilizing our troops with haste.

6275
04:09:42,650 --> 04:09:42,850
Ah.

6276
04:09:46,860 --> 04:09:48,860
Mario, great to see you again.

6277
04:09:49,260 --> 04:09:51,280
You've met Luigi, right?

6278
04:09:53,160 --> 04:09:54,040
Hey, bro!

6279
04:09:54,400 --> 04:09:56,520
I'm gonna be with Bowser for a bit.

6280
04:09:56,900 --> 04:09:59,620
I'm teaching how fun this game is!

6281
04:10:01,480 --> 04:10:02,400
That's right.

6282
04:10:02,820 --> 04:10:05,400
Luigi's gonna be helping out from now on.

6283
04:10:06,020 --> 04:10:11,780
So you better watch your back because our next fight will be a total and utter victory.

6284
04:10:13,340 --> 04:10:13,980
Minions!

6285
04:10:14,200 --> 04:10:16,060
We're getting the golden...

6286
04:10:16,060 --> 04:10:18,080
I mean, the next power star!

6287
04:10:18,500 --> 04:10:20,080
It was the golden banana.

6288
04:10:20,820 --> 04:10:21,140
Bro!

6289
04:10:21,480 --> 04:10:22,700
Isn't this great?

6290
04:10:24,200 --> 04:10:24,840
Luigi!

6291
04:10:25,180 --> 04:10:26,980
Are you sure this is a good decision?

6292
04:10:27,660 --> 04:10:28,920
Of course, bro!

6293
04:10:29,620 --> 04:10:31,520
Everyone deserves to have a fun.

6294
04:10:31,820 --> 04:10:33,400
It's a game, of course.

6295
04:10:34,060 --> 04:10:37,620
Anyway, I'm going with Bowser to Khan Capital.

6296
04:10:38,080 --> 04:10:39,660
I hope to meet you, too.

6297
04:10:40,260 --> 04:10:40,720
There.

6298
04:10:41,200 --> 04:10:43,900
I have a bad feeling about all this.

6299
04:10:44,500 --> 04:10:48,300
But, there's nothing else we can do but play along.

6300
04:10:49,020 --> 04:10:51,680
Let's head to World 5, too, whenever we're ready!

6301
04:10:53,320 --> 04:10:54,460
Wait for me!

6302
04:10:55,340 --> 04:10:58,720
Ooh, I bet that Cooper joke is up to no good.

6303
04:10:59,500 --> 04:11:00,200
What's this?

6304
04:11:01,280 --> 04:11:01,900
Oh!

6305
04:11:03,240 --> 04:11:05,560
Oh, is this, like, the Pokemon Center?

6306
04:11:07,800 --> 04:11:08,540
Yeah!

6307
04:11:13,730 --> 04:11:15,070
Oh, I don't want that.

6308
04:11:18,030 --> 04:11:19,810
I'm so worried that...

6309
04:11:21,090 --> 04:11:21,830
No.

6310
04:11:23,370 --> 04:11:25,710
I'm so worried I accidentally pressed yes.

6311
04:11:26,810 --> 04:11:29,670
Thank goodness someone here speak something out here than monkeys!

6312
04:11:30,210 --> 04:11:34,170
I feel like we're going insane trying to understand the cons and they're wild and battles!

6313
04:11:34,810 --> 04:11:36,410
It's literally double battle.

6314
04:11:36,930 --> 04:11:38,610
How does he not understand that?

6315
04:11:43,560 --> 04:11:44,080
Okay.

6316
04:11:44,260 --> 04:11:45,000
Oh, there's a Yoshi!

6317
04:11:45,480 --> 04:11:45,980
Noshin!

6318
04:11:47,360 --> 04:11:47,800
Hmm.

6319
04:11:48,180 --> 04:11:50,680
I don't really trust those Koopas that were here earlier.

6320
04:11:51,560 --> 04:11:53,000
Oh, is this a Mario?

6321
04:11:53,660 --> 04:11:55,260
Want to buy some tasty goodies?

6322
04:11:55,800 --> 04:11:56,340
Where are they?

6323
04:11:56,660 --> 04:11:58,000
Oh, Yoshi cookies!

6324
04:12:00,040 --> 04:12:01,720
All saddest problems.

6325
04:12:03,780 --> 04:12:05,200
Oh, that's so cute!

6326
04:12:05,840 --> 04:12:07,860
Oh my god, they're little monkeys!

6327
04:12:10,040 --> 04:12:12,040
Mushroom, super shroom, ultra shroom.

6328
04:12:12,160 --> 04:12:13,080
Okay, we need this.

6329
04:12:15,380 --> 04:12:16,780
Okay, we'll buy two of these.

6330
04:12:17,180 --> 04:12:22,580
We have to buy them or else or else he's gonna or else they're gonna come and get me, guys.

6331
04:12:22,840 --> 04:12:23,220
I...

6332
04:12:25,480 --> 04:12:28,040
Guys, I have to spend all my money, guys.

6333
04:12:28,600 --> 04:12:29,080
I...

6334
04:12:29,080 --> 04:12:30,540
Or they're gonna get me.

6335
04:12:31,000 --> 04:12:31,920
They're gonna...

6336
04:12:36,260 --> 04:12:37,200
Okay, there we go.

6337
04:12:38,960 --> 04:12:39,640
That's a cat.

6338
04:12:39,940 --> 04:12:43,280
Talk to that guy on the right counter and he'll help fill that thing up.

6339
04:12:45,100 --> 04:12:46,140
I'm too scared.

6340
04:12:48,100 --> 04:12:55,840
Cookies are the best things to eat, but Yoshi cookies provides all the essential nutrients for a goring body, but only for Yoshis.

6341
04:12:56,440 --> 04:12:58,500
He can still eat them to heal status almonds.

6342
04:13:01,240 --> 04:13:02,220
Ooh, banana.

6343
04:13:03,860 --> 04:13:05,120
Oh, outsiders?

6344
04:13:05,420 --> 04:13:08,260
You simply have to stay and learn the special move I recently learned.

6345
04:13:08,760 --> 04:13:09,280
Wonderful!

6346
04:13:09,680 --> 04:13:11,500
It's called grassy glide.

6347
04:13:11,780 --> 04:13:12,780
Okay, we're not learning that.

6348
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:16,540
I know, but like, I'm scared.

6349
04:13:18,420 --> 04:13:19,280
I'm not...

6350
04:13:19,280 --> 04:13:20,660
I'm not risking it.

6351
04:13:22,440 --> 04:13:23,920
I'm not risking it.

6352
04:13:25,200 --> 04:13:28,700
Lord, Bowser knew you'd be following us, so he told us to stay put.

6353
04:13:29,420 --> 04:13:30,440
Come on, Mario.

6354
04:13:30,640 --> 04:13:31,300
Come on, Mario.

6355
04:13:31,540 --> 04:13:32,940
We can beat them in a battle.

6356
04:13:33,400 --> 04:13:35,420
Yeah, and...

6357
04:13:35,420 --> 04:13:36,700
Oh my god!

6358
04:13:36,980 --> 04:13:38,820
Oh my god, they threw him away!

6359
04:13:39,440 --> 04:13:40,160
What are you doing?

6360
04:13:40,460 --> 04:13:41,840
We supposed to accept the challenge!

6361
04:13:42,240 --> 04:13:43,540
That's part of the rules!

6362
04:13:46,460 --> 04:13:49,040
Who told you that we follow the rules?

6363
04:13:50,720 --> 04:13:51,320
Mario!

6364
04:13:52,180 --> 04:13:53,200
Wait, that's illegal!

6365
04:13:53,740 --> 04:13:56,060
Now then, how about we fight fairly?

6366
04:13:56,280 --> 04:13:57,640
Wait, they just...

6367
04:13:57,640 --> 04:13:59,500
Wait, is he...

6368
04:13:59,500 --> 04:14:01,640
How will he survive that?

6369
04:14:02,000 --> 04:14:03,640
They just needed him!

6370
04:14:05,520 --> 04:14:07,720
Okay, to be fair, him...

6371
04:14:07,720 --> 04:14:08,440
them...

6372
04:14:08,440 --> 04:14:11,140
throwing away toad actually helps us.

6373
04:14:11,520 --> 04:14:12,100
Like...

6374
04:14:12,100 --> 04:14:13,920
Because we can actually...

6375
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:17,320
We can actually progress the game now.

6376
04:14:19,360 --> 04:14:20,280
Like...

6377
04:14:24,300 --> 04:14:26,560
That's good, we needed him out.

6378
04:14:30,620 --> 04:14:31,480
Oh my...

6379
04:14:31,480 --> 04:14:32,980
Oh wait, that doesn't do anything.

6380
04:14:33,580 --> 04:14:34,960
That should work, right?

6381
04:14:36,820 --> 04:14:37,440
Nice.

6382
04:14:38,700 --> 04:14:39,320
Okay.

6383
04:14:40,960 --> 04:14:42,820
Toad was 100%.

6384
04:14:42,820 --> 04:14:48,180
If you don't lie and say he wasn't, we all know he was 100% dead weight.

6385
04:14:52,380 --> 04:14:53,100
All right.

6386
04:14:58,180 --> 04:14:58,980
Slash him!

6387
04:15:00,260 --> 04:15:02,180
Okay, that should kill him, I was gonna say.

6388
04:15:03,640 --> 04:15:03,940
Yay!

6389
04:15:07,650 --> 04:15:08,490
U-turn?

6390
04:15:08,670 --> 04:15:09,290
What is U-turn?

6391
04:15:10,510 --> 04:15:11,250
Then switch is...

6392
04:15:11,250 --> 04:15:12,170
No, you don't do that.

6393
04:15:12,770 --> 04:15:14,530
You stay and fight till you die.

6394
04:15:21,490 --> 04:15:22,870
Okay, sucker punch.

6395
04:15:23,410 --> 04:15:25,010
Okay, what does sucker punch do?

6396
04:15:26,190 --> 04:15:29,430
Fight strikes first if the foe is preparing an attack.

6397
04:15:31,110 --> 04:15:32,670
Oh, we don't need struggle bug.

6398
04:15:36,090 --> 04:15:38,030
All right, thank you for the super chat.

6399
04:15:38,130 --> 04:15:38,890
Thank you, thank you.

6400
04:15:38,990 --> 04:15:44,050
I love how the minions battle theme is Bowser's battle theme to Mario and Luigi's Bowser's inside story.

6401
04:15:44,650 --> 04:15:45,090
Showtime!

6402
04:15:45,570 --> 04:15:46,330
Thank you for the super chat.

6403
04:15:46,450 --> 04:15:47,390
Thank you, thank you.

6404
04:15:48,670 --> 04:15:51,130
Yeah, I love like...

6405
04:15:51,130 --> 04:15:53,570
Oh wait, we can burn him.

6406
04:15:53,570 --> 04:15:57,850
I love the music in this one, especially when you're doing like...

6407
04:15:59,030 --> 04:16:00,710
Oh fuck, okay, never mind.

6408
04:16:02,870 --> 04:16:03,390
No!

6409
04:16:05,750 --> 04:16:07,310
It protected himself!

6410
04:16:08,410 --> 04:16:09,490
No, okay, whoops.

6411
04:16:12,250 --> 04:16:15,250
Yeah, the music is so good, especially when they made it like...

6412
04:16:15,250 --> 04:16:16,810
What's the version called?

6413
04:16:17,030 --> 04:16:18,070
Is it like...

6414
04:16:18,070 --> 04:16:19,510
8-bit songs?

6415
04:16:19,810 --> 04:16:20,770
Is that what it's called?

6416
04:16:22,730 --> 04:16:24,090
How do I keep lynching?

6417
04:16:30,950 --> 04:16:31,770
Not 8-bit?

6418
04:16:31,870 --> 04:16:32,430
What is it called?

6419
04:16:32,630 --> 04:16:34,150
Like, those types of tracks?

6420
04:16:35,110 --> 04:16:35,670
Chip tunes?

6421
04:16:35,890 --> 04:16:36,650
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

6422
04:16:37,510 --> 04:16:38,330
Is it chip tunes?

6423
04:16:38,530 --> 04:16:42,050
Like, they make it like that type, especially songs that didn't have a chip tune before.

6424
04:16:46,560 --> 04:16:47,880
How do I keep lynching?

6425
04:17:02,690 --> 04:17:03,750
Punch the bullet!

6426
04:17:05,390 --> 04:17:05,830
Yes!

6427
04:17:06,690 --> 04:17:07,130
Yes!

6428
04:17:08,530 --> 04:17:09,610
Punch the bullet!

6429
04:17:15,840 --> 04:17:17,600
All right, there's one more.

6430
04:17:17,940 --> 04:17:18,940
Hold up, trooper.

6431
04:17:20,320 --> 04:17:22,340
All right, we're squishing him.

6432
04:17:23,900 --> 04:17:25,980
Okay, we're squishing him next move.

6433
04:17:29,180 --> 04:17:29,900
Okay.

6434
04:17:32,620 --> 04:17:33,340
Now...

6435
04:17:33,340 --> 04:17:34,820
Now we're squishing him.

6436
04:17:42,930 --> 04:17:43,650
Boom.

6437
04:17:44,250 --> 04:17:45,410
Leave that imprint.

6438
04:17:50,770 --> 04:17:53,370
I throw a rock and I squish.

6439
04:18:00,800 --> 04:18:01,400
Yay!

6440
04:18:02,160 --> 04:18:03,220
We did it!

6441
04:18:03,580 --> 04:18:04,840
Our master plan!

6442
04:18:05,300 --> 04:18:05,900
Ruin!

6443
04:18:07,220 --> 04:18:09,960
Okay, your plan was literally the Chuck Toad.

6444
04:18:11,120 --> 04:18:11,340
Oh!

6445
04:18:12,420 --> 04:18:14,320
Looks like I've been separated from Mario!

6446
04:18:14,680 --> 04:18:17,380
I better make it back to him as soon as possible!

6447
04:18:17,640 --> 04:18:18,580
All right, we leave now.

6448
04:18:21,520 --> 04:18:25,180
We'll let future Jokey worry about that.

6449
04:18:26,280 --> 04:18:28,120
I think it's a good stopping point.

6450
04:18:28,260 --> 04:18:28,940
We played...

6451
04:18:28,940 --> 04:18:29,700
We played...

6452
04:18:29,700 --> 04:18:31,360
We played a lot of progress today.

6453
04:18:31,960 --> 04:18:33,440
We finished the world.

6454
04:18:35,720 --> 04:18:37,780
I think it's a good stopping point.

6455
04:18:38,480 --> 04:18:38,780
Oh!

6456
04:18:39,380 --> 04:18:40,360
That was fun!

6457
04:18:40,920 --> 04:18:43,140
Yeah, we've been playing for four hours.

6458
04:18:44,000 --> 04:18:44,400
Ah!

6459
04:18:44,740 --> 04:18:46,200
I had a great time!

6460
04:18:46,420 --> 04:18:47,400
This game is really fun.

6461
04:18:47,560 --> 04:18:48,280
I like the...

6462
04:18:48,280 --> 04:18:48,760
I don't know.

6463
04:18:48,820 --> 04:18:50,240
I just really enjoyed the...

6464
04:18:50,240 --> 04:18:56,840
I really enjoyed the story so far and just like messing around by capturing drag wounds.

6465
04:18:57,180 --> 04:18:58,520
Oh, you guys have been enjoying this playthrough!

6466
04:18:58,860 --> 04:19:00,500
I don't even know how much we have left.

6467
04:19:00,500 --> 04:19:02,320
I think we have like four more worlds, right?

6468
04:19:02,780 --> 04:19:03,500
So like...

6469
04:19:03,500 --> 04:19:04,480
We could...

6470
04:19:04,480 --> 04:19:05,240
I think...

6471
04:19:05,240 --> 04:19:08,220
Okay, to be fair, we got very distracted in the Waluigi world.

6472
04:19:12,200 --> 04:19:14,020
But I had a lot of fun so far.

6473
04:19:14,520 --> 04:19:16,360
I hope you guys have been having fun watching.

6474
04:19:17,140 --> 04:19:17,460
Um...

6475
04:19:17,460 --> 04:19:19,360
I have to feed dad soon.

6476
04:19:19,640 --> 04:19:19,940
But...

6477
04:19:19,940 --> 04:19:20,920
Sageon, thank you for the super chat.

6478
04:19:21,060 --> 04:19:21,220
Thank you.

6479
04:19:21,320 --> 04:19:21,740
Thank you.

6480
04:19:21,780 --> 04:19:22,560
Thanks, Stokey.

6481
04:19:22,760 --> 04:19:23,600
Thank you, guys.

6482
04:19:23,760 --> 04:19:24,860
I'm glad you guys have been enjoying it.

6483
04:19:24,880 --> 04:19:26,140
I'm happy to be streaming again.

6484
04:19:26,700 --> 04:19:27,020
Um...

6485
04:19:27,020 --> 04:19:28,280
I always forget, like...

6486
04:19:28,280 --> 04:19:28,820
No, not forget.

6487
04:19:28,980 --> 04:19:30,960
I always, like, get scared and be like, oh my god.

6488
04:19:31,100 --> 04:19:34,560
What if, like, I just forget how to stream whenever I take these, like, breaks and stuff?

6489
04:19:34,720 --> 04:19:39,840
And then we can fix our microphone and, like, adjust the sound setting so I sound less weird.

6490
04:19:39,840 --> 04:19:40,500
Um...

6491
04:19:42,640 --> 04:19:43,120
Um...

6492
04:19:43,840 --> 04:19:44,320
Um...

6493
04:19:44,320 --> 04:19:45,460
But yes, thank you, everybody.

6494
04:19:47,720 --> 04:19:48,200
Um...

6495
04:19:48,200 --> 04:19:50,180
Thank you, everybody, for watching.

6496
04:19:50,760 --> 04:19:51,160
Um...

6497
04:19:51,160 --> 04:19:56,980
I wanna say, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and run around to get that blood flowing.

6498
04:19:57,160 --> 04:20:00,860
And if you say it for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it.

6499
04:20:01,020 --> 04:20:03,200
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

6500
04:20:03,880 --> 04:20:04,620
Bye, guys.

6501
04:20:04,620 --> 04:20:05,940
Bye.
