00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Welcome to WrestleTuber 2024!

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Huge shoutout to all the members, all the Vtubers coming in here, giving up their day and time participating in this event to wrestle, to give their interviews.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,240
So, really huge shoutout to every participating member.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,780
Each winner of both the show matches and the tournament will receive the WrestleTuber badge!

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:32,920
Gamersup is fully funding and sponsoring this event, and they will be providing and shipping out the WrestleTuber belts to the champions.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,480
But, it feels weird that this seat is empty.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,300
I wonder where is my co-capt...

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,060
Oh shit!

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,780
Huh?

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,540
Seth?

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,740
What was that?

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,420
Kept you waiting, huh?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,320
This wrestling ring is already haunted by the champion, Doki Bird.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,980
Okay, security?

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,120
I thought I said no crashes tonight.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,760
What the fuck was that?

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,300
How did they get here?

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,840
Hello?

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,520
Hello?

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,320
Hello?

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,260
That was your cue!

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,460
I don't know how I could have made that any more clear here.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
Wait, where do I go?

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,640
Little bit...

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,560
Ladies, as the first matchup of the day, how are you guys feeling?

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,140
I'm really hoping that it's a nice quick match, because, you know, it sucks to hurt people and...

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,100
Your name is Limu, alright?

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm gonna take those limes, alright?

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,320
I'm gonna cut them in half, and I'm gonna squirt them on your eyeballs.

30
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,560
And then I'm gonna take another lime, and I'm gonna squirt them on my own eyeballs.

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,240
And then I'm gonna eat your ass.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
You're gonna eat her ass?

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,880
Wait, what?

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,620
You're free?

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,880
You're gonna eat her ass?

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,320
It's been six years.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,380
Sixty-five million years, Gerard.

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,360
How have you been doing?

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,600
Getting pregnant, I hear.

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,420
You've been doing your research.

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,280
I see.

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
The galaxy never disappoints.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,640
You've always been watching me.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,460
I know you have three children who live under a bridge with no mom, no dad, and you eat limes.

45
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,720
That is none of your business!

46
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,400
Keep your nose out of my life!

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,320
Are you crying?

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,140
I'm not crying.

49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm trying to live.

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,020
Gerard, do you have a question for me?

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,180
Yes.

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,800
Mahogany or oak?

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,500
Mahogany.

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,040
Okay, good.

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,940
That's gonna be the coffin.

56
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,260
I'm gonna put you in six feet under.

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,520
Oh, son of a bitch!

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,380
Hey, Hakko.

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
We got some TMI, Justin.

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,360
Is this from the bathroom?

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:29,900
What is this?

62
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
Yeah, you're like, in the bathroom, Hakko?

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,220
Like, what the fuck?

64
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,320
I literally told you, hold up.

65
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm taking a shit.

66
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,700
Ping me.

67
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,720
Was it a nervous shit?

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,380
Absolutely.

69
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,900
Wait, I thought, like, birds eat eels.

70
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,040
He's a tiny bird.

71
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,260
Okay, to be fair, he is pretty tiny.

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,420
My tail is as tall as him.

73
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,200
You have to understand.

74
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,820
Sorry, this is the accurate height.

75
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,260
Shinri?

77
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:50,800
Shinri?

78
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,640
Shinri?

79
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,260
Is that how he sounds?

80
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,760
It's me.

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,160
It's me.

82
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,540
It's me.

83
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,040
I'm real fine.

84
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,360
Yeah.

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,180
Shinri, um, do you think...

86
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,940
Yeah.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah.

88
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,820
Yeah.

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,680
You can't understand what you're fucking saying!

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,760
That's right.

91
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,200
That's right.

92
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,920
I know half of the boys out there fucking got slaughtered, bro.

93
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,480
Now, as the sensei, you know, I gotta come out and win for them.

94
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,420
You better, senpai.

95
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,580
I'm rooting for you, buddy!

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Hell yeah, baby.

97
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,200
You know, I gotta fucking channel my inner Steve Irwin and fucking tackle you down like a little fucking crocodile.

98
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,100
He fucking died to a stingray!

99
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,940
I just had to poke you in the fronting heart!

100
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,520
Bro, you don't look like a stingray!

101
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,060
Bro, I can just punch you in the heart and you're fucked!

102
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,840
Bring your ass.

103
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,700
You look like the chicken I had at Nando's today.

104
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,440
Wow!

105
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,700
You're just a little robo-boy.

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,560
Can't handle all this... kangaroo.

107
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,980
I'm gonna bring my kangaroo.

108
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,520
Yeah?

109
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
You're gonna bring a kangaroo?

110
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,000
I will.

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,400
I'll bring out two kangaroos.

112
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
I'll bring my computer to smack the shit out of you with.

113
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,820
I'll bring... even more computers.

114
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,740
You're fighting a leprechaun reject or what's going on here?

116
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,460
Excuse me, that's Fuyo Man?

117
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,900
Fuyo Man smash.

118
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,360
What is this?

119
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,760
Fuyo Man slaps the rap horn.

120
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,220
I'm so fucking dead, you guys.

121
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,160
You're dead already, but you haven't even...

122
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,860
Fuyo Man, Fuyo Man, please, mercy, mercy.

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
No mercy.

124
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
Snuff, you're gonna take that?

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,360
Yeah.

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,720
What do these cards say?

127
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,220
Just call me Daft Punk, because tonight I'm gonna get lucky.

128
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,260
Hello, hello, how are we?

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,120
How are you?

130
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,740
You're about to face someone with a very stinky face.

131
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,000
A stinky diaper.

132
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,540
I will not stoop to this thick and twisted diaper meta.

133
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,740
Today, I fight as a man, not as a baby.

134
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,060
You just say that because you're scared of the diaper.

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,820
I don't know how you're gonna win without the diaper, but I'm looking forward to see how this match is gonna go.

136
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,320
I don't know.

137
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,260
I'm not convinced, man.

138
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Okay, everyone who's had a freaking diaper wins, man.

139
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,760
I'm scared.

140
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,460
No diapers for me.

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,060
We're going commando today, baby.

142
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,040
That's sad, because when you shit yourself, they're all gonna see.

143
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,680
You know what?

144
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,040
That's fine.

145
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,880
Shit into the air.

146
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,360
That's great.

147
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,540
We shit like men.

148
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,000
Not cowards.

149
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,320
We don't need diapers.

150
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,780
Can't wait for that chocolate fountain, man.

151
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,160
Can't wait.

152
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,240
I see.

153
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,240
Dropper.

154
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,260
Damn!

155
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,600
Wow!

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,700
The advantage here keeps changing.

157
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,380
Who's winning?

158
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,320
Bettle or Luto?

159
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,400
I can't tell.

160
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,600
Oh, they keep missing.

161
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,380
They keep jumping and missing.

162
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,100
Ah, there we go.

163
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,380
I wanna see what happens to Luto if she removes her diaper.

164
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
It's like those little power limiters, right?

165
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,480
It's like walkways.

166
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,080
It's a power limiter, definitely.

167
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,900
Take out the diaper.

168
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,140
She needs that limiter to fight in a normal man's wrestling match.

169
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,340
Okay.

170
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,440
Oh, the top.

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,760
Oh, but Bettle didn't like that.

172
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,260
Oh, headbutt right to the ribs.

173
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,180
Oh, another.

174
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,740
Oh, what's he doing?

175
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,140
Oh, top of the rope.

176
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,440
Oh, I thought he was gonna take it off again.

177
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,840
Come on, do the flip.

178
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,600
You know you wanna.

179
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,340
Max luck.

180
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,160
Oh, fucking broke his ass.

181
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,600
Little, little fuck.

182
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,720
Little squish.

183
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,300
Oh, what is that?

184
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,780
No, the low blow.

185
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,960
Yeah, you're gonna fucking kick me in the balls.

186
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,980
That's illegal.

187
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,860
Yeah, I think again.

188
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,120
The illegal move.

189
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,760
Two, three.

190
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
I can't believe it.

191
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,260
I can't believe it.

192
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,560
I can't believe it.

193
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
I can't believe it.

194
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,040
I can't believe it.

195
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,920
With a low blow to win the match.

196
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,500
I didn't think it could get dirtier than the diaper, but here we are.

197
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,380
I, yeah.

198
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,360
My fucking balls.

199
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,940
Listen, to defeat your opponent, you attack the source.

200
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,780
The diaper is the source.

201
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,400
You will go for the heart.

202
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,620
I will avenge Doki.

203
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,780
I will flip on your face and I will beat you to a pulp.

204
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
I will take your teeth and remove the venom from them.

205
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,100
It's not necessarily a venomous snake.

206
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,220
I'm one of the types that constrict you.

207
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,600
I'll have you tapping before long.

208
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,820
Let's, uh, let's just say that.

209
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
I don't care what your kinks are.

210
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,000
Fight.

211
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Billion seems to be moving at times two speed.

212
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,540
Yeah, I was just about to say that.

213
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,240
She's looking so fucking speedy right now.

214
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,700
Oh, my God.

215
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,980
She got that Final Fantasy haste spell on.

216
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,360
I thought that was me.

217
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,980
Or drugs.

218
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:09,760
Let's go.

219
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,060
Oh, right in the gut.

220
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,800
Oh, right in the face.

221
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,380
The Rose of Lucera.

222
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,680
How do you block an arm that thick?

223
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,860
Whoops.

224
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,100
Oh, that was close.

225
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh.

226
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,960
Oh.

227
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,380
Whoops.

228
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,400
Whoa.

229
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh.

230
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,980
What am I watching?

231
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,780
The wrestling or Olympics?

232
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,420
These flips are fucking insane.

233
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Fillion's in the wrong place.

234
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,040
She should be at the fucking Gymnastic Olympics.

235
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,580
All right.

236
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Not the fucking WWE.

237
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,920
But it's not on me to judge her career path.

238
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,280
One.

239
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,560
Three.

240
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,660
This is it.

241
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,340
That was it.

242
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,460
Fillion.

243
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:35,940
Fillion won.

244
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,860
Fucking huge.

245
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,480
Against Bulky Bogan.

246
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,460
Holy crap.

247
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, shit.

248
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,400
Sorry.

249
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,460
Oh, shit.

250
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,080
Oh, shit.

251
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,780
It was a good fun.

252
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:47,820
Yeah, it was.

253
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,880
The intermission was wild.

254
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,340
Oh, sorry.

255
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,620
We needed a couple extra minutes.

256
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,300
Matyarikun.

257
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,240
You are a Bug.

258
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,840
And what do you have to say about that?

259
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,560
I am a Bug.

260
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,360
And I have a lot to say about that.

261
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,720
I hope she kind of ... I hope she eats my fright.

262
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,620
That's what I hope.

263
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Wow.

264
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,980
Are you technically a ghost spirit?

265
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,760
That's a really great question.

266
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,260
Why are you laughing?

267
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,620
Why are you laughing?

268
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,680
Why are you laughing?

269
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,660
I think Batara is choking.

270
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,980
Batara, how are you going to beat Mint?

271
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,840
First, I'm going to show her my boobs and I'm going to show her my butt.

272
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,160
And then she'll be too embarrassed to fight me anymore.

273
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,940
My personality is shit, so it's all I've got.

274
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,920
I need to know now, Mint, do you like ass and boob?

275
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,260
I'm an ass and a boob.

276
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,240
Ass is life and boob is hometown.

277
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,460
I'm going to motorboat the fuck out of those boobs.

278
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm going to get on them nice and juicy and I'm going to...

279
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,020
I'm going to go down in two seconds.

280
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,240
Mint!

281
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
It's fine, I'm getting her defenses low.

282
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,120
The bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?

283
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,720
What is she doing?

284
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,120
She's emoting on me.

285
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,060
This is so rude.

286
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,580
She's doing her mom dance on you.

287
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,900
Where did she go?

288
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,920
Oh, and she... Batara got out of the fence and doesn't know that she got the suplex.

289
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
Oh my god.

290
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,160
Holy shit.

291
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,060
The London Bridge suplex.

292
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,940
Of course I can pull off the London Bridge.

293
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,260
I coined the term.

294
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,860
Of course.

295
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,080
The London Bridge was created for you.

296
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,000
By Mint in the 1980s.

297
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,180
When she was just 70 years old.

298
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,440
And another.

299
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,220
It's in her pin.

300
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,180
Here you go.

301
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,340
One.

302
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,300
Two.

303
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,680
Three.

304
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,240
Yes!

305
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,680
I got everybody!

306
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,760
Mint!

307
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,200
Batara, you talked very lowly about yourself and I think that may have affected your performance.

308
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,120
I know.

309
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:16,700
I know.

310
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:16,900
I know.

311
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:16,960
I know.

312
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,020
I know.

313
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,300
I don't think so so much.

314
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,940
I think...

315
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,840
I don't think.

316
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have a concussion.

317
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,660
Do you recall how many glasses of wine you had before you stepped into the match?

318
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,160
That's a great question.

319
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,140
Thank you for asking.

320
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,440
You know...

321
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
This is...

322
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,280
Oh no.

323
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,720
Oh my god.

324
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,360
Oh no.

325
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,920
Batara is having a stroke.

326
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,600
Someone call 911.

327
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,040
Someone call 911.

328
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,260
Oh my god.

329
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,500
Someone is having a stroke!

330
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,480
Someone's having a stroke!

331
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,840
Oh god.

332
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,540
I...

333
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,040
I'm scared.

334
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,780
Why are you scared?

335
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,760
Why are you scared?

336
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,420
I...

337
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,940
I've seen that thing in the ring.

338
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,200
That's...

339
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,720
It's not human.

340
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:55,940
...

341
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,720
It's just chill.

342
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,180
It's just chill.

343
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,400
Let's just chill.

344
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,520
Let's just chill.

345
00:10:59,520 --> 00:10:59,760
Listen.

346
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,680
I made a promise.

347
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,520
Made a promise.

348
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,540
I made a promise.

349
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:02,940
I made a promise.

350
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
I beat the diaper meta.

351
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,180
The diaper meta's going down.

352
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Or I die in the ring.

353
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,800
The flip jump and the fucking...

354
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,820
Oh my God!

355
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,840
Is this just Tekken?

356
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,880
He plays one Tekken, and is now an expert.

357
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,220
Yeah.

358
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,840
What is in Fuyo Man's pants?

359
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,900
I mean... you know what's in his pants.

360
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,580
On the back side?

361
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Oh, the back side!

362
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,360
You think I meant...

363
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,580
You also know what's in his pants.

364
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm being told that it's a coin.

365
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,900
I hope it's not a chocolate coin.

366
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,140
Fiddle, knock him out so he can go inside!

367
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh my god.

368
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,560
Fiddle slid in like a ferret.

369
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,060
Is Fuyo Man at...

370
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,340
No!

371
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,820
Fuyo Man got him DQ'd!

372
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,720
Fiddle wins!

373
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,920
Oh my god!

374
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,300
Fiddle eliminated both diaper players!

375
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,480
Fuyo Man, what happened?

376
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,700
Fuyo Man BP.

377
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,780
You know what I'm more surprised by?

378
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,300
The fact that Fillion made it this far.

379
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,200
But she looks like she has no muscle in those bones.

380
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,860
Fillion, are you just gonna take that?

381
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,620
I know, I know.

382
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,460
But here's the thing.

383
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,460
You know who's built like me?

384
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,020
Luffy.

385
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,020
And he's going to be king of the pirates.

386
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,600
That's true.

387
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,560
I'm literally carrying your legacy right now.

388
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,700
Oh shit, you're right.

389
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,760
Sorry, sorry.

390
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,820
Fillion, kick her ass.

391
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,780
Hey, hey, wait a second!

392
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,440
Look at how malnourished she is.

393
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,880
Did anyone feed her?

394
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,140
Did anyone feed Fillion at all?

395
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,420
Is she yellow from being a Simpsons?

396
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,780
Or is she yellow from her scurvy?

397
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,340
I feel like we've kept Fillion in a cage since this was announced.

398
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,200
The crowd's cheering her on.

399
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,140
And she hits those!

400
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,440
See?

401
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,100
Oh.

402
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,860
Wait.

403
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
You teleported!

404
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
Oh my god!

405
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
You teleported to Fillion!

406
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
That was a big personal kid.

407
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,880
You really did.

408
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,120
You're gonna lose after teleporting!

409
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,380
Oh no!

410
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:13,880
Oh no!

411
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,620
One!

412
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,840
Two!

413
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,100
Stop!

414
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,560
I don't

415
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,680
believe you lost after teleporting!

416
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,020
You know what?

417
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,800
At least I beat Matara.

418
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,600
That's all that matters.

419
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,580
Mint, you were a worthy opponent.

420
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,240
One of the toughest I've ever faced.

421
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,860
I have a spot on my crew just for you.

422
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,740
On the right hand of my ship.

423
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,500
Leading my steering wheel.

424
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,340
What?

425
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,700
She can't drive though.

426
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,440
Yes I can!

427
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,860
Shut up!

428
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,680
This match?

429
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,880
It's not just the finals.

430
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,620
This is personal.

431
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,840
What did Fillion do to you?

432
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,180
Why?

433
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,900
Fillion called me Charlie!

434
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,320
Oh, you're still mad about that?

435
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,980
Yeah, I'm still mad about it!

436
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,980
You all did this to me.

437
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm gonna take my fist and put it through your trolley face.

438
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,200
You understand me?

439
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,680
Oh my god.

440
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,300
She pulled out the Charlie.

441
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,240
She called you by your fake name.

442
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,840
Well, then I'll call you David.

443
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,860
David?

444
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,020
David?

445
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,700
My name's not David!

446
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,420
David!

447
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,840
David!

448
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,740
Seems like Battle is currently winning the polls, Fillion.

449
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,520
Wait, how?

450
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,620
Battle's like a knock-off version of me though.

451
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,120
Is he not?

452
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,460
What?

453
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,240
What the?

454
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,660
What the?

455
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,940
Do you do the ball grabs though?

456
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,340
I fight with honor.

457
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,800
And I fight for my friends.

458
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,660
What friends?

459
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,940
Listen up, Charlie.

460
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,820
Your name?

461
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,960
Is Beta.

462
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Your drip?

463
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,660
Is Beta.

464
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,580
And your favorite video game?

465
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,820
Is for Betas!

466
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,940
How did you know I liked League of Legends?

467
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,080
Oh my god.

468
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,480
Oh my god.

469
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,820
Oh my god.

470
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,560
She's beyond saving.

471
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

472
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,400
It speaks for itself.

473
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,400
Like every match he got through, he was not confident at all.

474
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,880
Yeah, exactly.

475
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,760
It was like that... being pushed into...

476
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,220
What?

477
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,140
Oh, that is...

478
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,380
One...

479
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,200
Two...

480
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,580
Okay.

481
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,160
Okay.

482
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,540
It's a match.

483
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,220
And there was...

484
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,780
Oh, Finn.

485
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,960
What's going on?

486
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,740
Oh my god.

487
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,540
Oh my god.

488
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,740
He's getting spanked like a bad child.

489
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,560
Bad baby.

490
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,120
Bad baby.

491
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,940
Bad baby.

492
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,060
Bad baby.

493
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,640
Bad baby.

494
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,640
Bad baby.

495
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,640
It was like a fake of this... of the whole tournament.

496
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,360
Oh yeah.

497
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,820
I think so.

498
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,660
Wait.

499
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm better.

500
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,020
One.

501
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,640
One.

502
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,200
Two.

503
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,780
Two.

504
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh that was so close.

505
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,060
That was so close.

506
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,700
I thought it was over.

507
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,460
I was ready to call it.

508
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:25,860
Oh my god.

509
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,740
I felt like the ref might have been paid off.

510
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,900
That should have been three.

511
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,980
I counted in my head and it was three.

512
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,520
Hey, what are you saying, Doki?

513
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,880
Are you saying this is not a fair, you know...

514
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
Well, I'm not saying it.

515
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,900
I'm implying it.

516
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,380
Is this your tournament?

517
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:40,900
Yes.

518
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,380
She sees me.

519
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:42,940
Here we go!

520
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,320
One!

521
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,920
Two!

522
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,400
Two!

523
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,020
Oh!

524
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:45,960
What?

525
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,060
Elaine gets trolled.

526
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,760
Oh!

527
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,740
Oh!

528
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,420
Oh!

529
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,180
Where'd the lights go?

530
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:50,920
This is so weird!

531
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,180
Oh my god!

532
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,740
She copied the moves!

533
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,000
It doesn't matter!

534
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,040
She knew what to do!

535
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,040
She knew what to do after me!

536
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,120
Yeah, she downloaded your moveset and knew how to counter it.

537
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,600
Oh my god!

538
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,120
Vale is maxing that luck right now!

539
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,560
That did not look good for Fillian.

540
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,560
That looks like it's definitely her.

541
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Oh, her legs.

542
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,900
She ain't flipping anytime soon anymore.

543
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,960
I don't think so.

544
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,740
He's getting rid of all her appendages so she'll never flip again.

545
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,160
It's because she doesn't get enough calcium.

546
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,120
Her bones are brittle.

547
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,060
Someone throw her an orange.

548
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,060
He's not done playing around with her.

549
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,120
Oh!

550
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,880
And another one.

551
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,660
Oh, here we go!

552
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,320
Whoa!

553
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,500
One, two, three!

554
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,870
Your winner for WrestleTuber 2024!

555
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,630
The Charlie Denier!

556
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,910
The Diaper Destroyer!

557
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,450
The Baby Girl himself!

558
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,790
Valor!

559
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,890
That was the most insane match I've seen today, Mint.

560
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,530
Absolutely.

561
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,150
It was worthy of the finale.

562
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,790
How do you feel being such a winner and holding that championship belt?

563
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,510
You know, it feels good.

564
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,230
It feels good.

565
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,230
I had some brothers in this and this.

566
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,650
I had to kill my brother to get here.

567
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,470
So I had to absorb his nutrients to become more powerful.

568
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:35,590
Vettel here will be holding on to that champion belt to represent the winner of the very first WrestleTuber 2024.

569
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,510
No one will stop him.

570
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,510
Unless...

571
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,840
We now have a new contender?

572
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,460
Who are you, sir?

573
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,560
I'm Heavyro.

574
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
I don't have to fight him, do I?

575
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,940
Oh, you're fighting this 3D man right now.

576
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,260
I'mma make that, I'mma make that heavyro.

577
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,160
It's not over, Vettel.

578
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,640
You gotta defend your title.

579
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,840
Already?

580
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,100
Are you ready?

581
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,740
Where is my bell?

582
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,920
Where is my bell?

583
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,020
It's over there, sir.

584
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,420
It's over there.

585
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:53,840
No, no, no.

586
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,660
Please don't hurt us.

587
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,380
All right, battle.

588
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,820
Good luck.

589
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,760
Good luck, battle.

590
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,320
Off to the ring we go.

591
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,600
Good luck, everybody.

592
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,580
I don't know.

593
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,340
Battle looks pretty puny next to that guy right now.

594
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,780
That one got me.

595
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,960
Oh, shit.

596
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,440
You're...

597
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,560
Oh, my God.

598
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,020
This is definitely the wrong way, class.

599
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
Holy shit.

600
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,820
Oh, my God.

601
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,100
This just falls to the ground.

602
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,760
It's okay, battle.

603
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,320
You can do it.

604
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:19,900
It's okay, battle.

605
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,660
Just get up, battle.

606
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,360
Get up, battle.

607
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,080
You got this.

608
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,240
Oh, my God.

609
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,940
Oh, my God.

610
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,100
The arms are limp.

611
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,040
The arms are limp.

612
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,240
What the fuck?

613
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,580
Battle, please.

614
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,060
What the fuck?

615
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,240
It's a fucking double flip into battle.

616
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,260
Guys, I...

617
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,520
Guys, I think I feel a little bit bad.

618
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,820
He's tired.

619
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,800
He, like, totally let his guard down thinking he was tired.

620
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,100
He was done with all these matches.

621
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,740
Yeah, like, he unclenched, you know?

622
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah.

623
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,180
He was fully clenched up during the entire tournament, and he thought...

624
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,620
Battle thought it was just over.

625
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,500
Yeah.

626
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,800
Wait.

627
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,160
Is it...

628
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,920
Uh-oh.

629
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,380
Uh-oh.

630
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,660
Wait.

631
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,240
Oh!

632
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,860
What in the flip?

633
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,060
Oh, no.

634
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,740
He's just...

635
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,940
He's just emoting into the ring.

636
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,320
Oh, God.

637
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,670
No way.

638
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,170
No way.

639
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,550
Oh, my God.

640
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,070
Are we done?

641
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,010
All of five minutes.

642
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,430
But we, um, yeah.

643
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,750
We have a new champion!

644
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,830
Yuuman.

645
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,630
Did I win?

646
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,770
Yeah.

647
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,030
No.

648
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,790
He had the title for 14 seconds.

649
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,210
How did it feel to be a winner for five minutes, Battle.

650
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,010
Well, it felt great.

651
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,370
It felt great.

652
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,910
I'm, you know, I'm happy to be a winner of something for about 5 minutes, but...

653
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,050
I just lost it already...

654
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,350
So proud of you, man.

655
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,450
Pretty proud of you.

656
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,970
A real chad.

657
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,750
Violence.

658
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:15,410
U MAN, U MAN, U MAN, U MAN, U MAN, U MAN

659
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,850
U MAN, U MAN, What are your words to your fans!

660
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,970
To your audience!

661
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:23,330
Um...

662
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,370
Check my music video.

663
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,490
Is this a self-promo?

664
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,990
Wow.
