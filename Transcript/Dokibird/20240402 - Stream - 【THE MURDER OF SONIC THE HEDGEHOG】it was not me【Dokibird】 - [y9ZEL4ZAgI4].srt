00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,560
April Fools!

3
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
The screen... we're so back!

4
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,790
Hello.

5
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
Today I'm a little naked today.

6
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,090
What is this knife I'm holding?

7
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm making a salad.

8
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,350
What do you mean?

9
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,850
I'm... I'm... I'm my true form.

10
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,750
Also my brain today.

11
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,410
I just need you guys to know.

12
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,310
Um... I had four hours of sleep.

13
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,490
My brain's a little bit more enhanced than usual.

14
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,770
I might be a little more stupid than usual because like...

15
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,530
I had like three to four hours of sleep today because I was working.

16
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:42,010
I... I spent my entire night... I went to bed at like 9am today.

17
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,910
And then... yes today.

18
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,030
I went to bed at 9am today.

19
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,390
And then...

20
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,390
yes today.

21
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,390
I went to bed at 9am today.

22
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,850
And then like I woke up at...

23
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,810
What time did I woke up?

24
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,690
12?

25
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,750
At like 12 or 1pm.

26
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,270
So my brain is not okay.

27
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,330
But that's fine!

28
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,330
Today's the best day to not be okay.

29
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,210
It's April Fools!

30
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,570
If I do something fucked up...

31
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,390
I can be like... Ha ha!

32
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,690
April Fools!

33
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,750
That's not me.

34
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,270
That's not my intrusive thoughts thinking.

35
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,250
I'm just joking.

36
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,070
I'm just joking with you guys.

37
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,490
April Fools!

38
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,350
You'll never know what is right or wrong.

39
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,690
So yes, my brain currently...

40
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,410
Might need a little bit more oxygen today.

41
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,250
But I sort of like fucked up with that.

42
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:32,930
So...

43
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,450
Right now I'm actually on a stream of consciousness.

44
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,750
Where I'm not even thinking about what I'm saying.

45
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,090
And... Oh god this is not a good idea.

46
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,750
This is not...

47
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,230
Usually I have...

48
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,970
I know it's really fucking wild.

49
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,550
But usually I would have this little filter on.

50
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,670
Like a little... you know...

51
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,370
Don't be a brand risk filter.

52
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,310
You know?

53
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,570
Like...

54
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,630
You're... You're a...

55
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,750
You're an internet personality now Doki.

56
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,290
Don't say anything that you will regret.

57
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,770
But today...

58
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,270
Today is a little risky.

59
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,310
When there's not enough oxygen going to my brain.

60
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,930
It is...

61
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,490
It is a little risky right now.

62
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,170
For me to stream because...

63
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,670
I don't think I did not have a lot of sleep.

64
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,710
So we'll see how this goes.

65
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,230
We're gonna see how this goes.

66
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,750
But it's okay.

67
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,890
It's okay.

68
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,950
What are you gonna do?

69
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,130
What are you gonna do?

70
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,170
Cancel a tomato?

71
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,490
I'm a fucking fruit.

72
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,130
You can't do that to me.

73
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,570
Anyway, yes.

74
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,990
Happy April Fool's everybody.

75
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,590
I hope you guys...

76
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,450
I hope...

77
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,390
I hope...

78
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,490
I hope you guys enjoyed...

79
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,950
Welcoming back our intro.

80
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,210
It was...

81
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,450
It's finally here!

82
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,230
I know like April F...

83
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,770
I could have just played the intro for an hour straight.

84
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,010
But I sort of actually really wanted to play the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

85
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,150
And...

86
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,450
It's been like a game that I wanted to play since last year.

87
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,450
So like...

88
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:10,950
I was like...

89
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,450
You know what?

90
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,170
I was so...

91
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,110
I was so sad.

92
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,590
I was actually waiting to like...

93
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,110
You know...

94
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,690
Cause like...

95
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,450
Japan is really, really good with like April Fools.

96
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:21,690
And...

97
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,090
Um...

98
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,650
Um...

99
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,270
So I was like...

100
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,730
Oh wait...

101
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,710
Cause like they released...

102
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,370
Cause you know...

103
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,810
Japan really goes like all out when it comes to like April Fool pranks for some reason.

104
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,870
I don't know why.

105
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,990
I don't know why.

106
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,670
But like...

107
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,730
It's always Japan that does like...

108
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,370
Like...

109
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,970
Pull all stops and does like a hundred percent on April Fools jokes.

110
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,430
You know?

111
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,130
Like people in America...

112
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,210
They don't try as hard as Japan.

113
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,130
Like...

114
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,730
Like Japan will make like actual like...

115
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,010
I was so scared.

116
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,770
Killala finally announced like a new season.

117
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,430
But I couldn't even tell if it was real.

118
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,350
I was like...

119
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,910
Please don't be April Fools.

120
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,970
Please don't be a sick April Fools joke.

121
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,650
Because they've done this before.

122
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,530
They will release like fully animated trailers.

123
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,130
And just be like...

124
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,690
Kihi April Fools.

125
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,590
I swear.

126
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,590
They've done it.

127
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,030
They did it for Panty and Stalk...

128
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,670
I remember they did it for Panty and Stalking before they actually announced like...

129
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,150
They did that before for Panty and Stalking.

130
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,030
And it hurt.

131
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,770
It actually hurt so much.

132
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,170
So I couldn't tell.

133
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,670
I couldn't tell.

134
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,850
So like...

135
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,550
Anyway...

136
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,930
Um...

137
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,550
Before I posted my schedule...

138
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,630
I was actually waiting to see if like Japan was gonna do this.

139
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,970
Like if they were gonna release anything similar to the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

140
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,530
So I can be like...

141
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,870
So I could...

142
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,290
I could be like...

143
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,370
I could be like...

144
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,470
Okay I could get in on this.

145
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,970
The FOMO.

146
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,150
Flavor of the month.

147
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,350
I could get in on the April Fools.

148
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,870
Flavor of the month.

149
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,330
If they release another game.

150
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,810
On April Fools.

151
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,570
But they didn't.

152
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,150
They didn't release anything new.

153
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,090
I was so sad.

154
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,010
I was like...

155
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,090
Oh my god.

156
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,210
No April Fools flavor of the month?

157
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,610
What is this?

158
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:19,770
How would we stream or survive without our regularly released content?

159
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,690
Oh my god.

160
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,130
We need new content.

161
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,630
But it's okay.

162
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,230
It's okay.

163
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,350
I haven't played the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

164
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,550
So it's almost new for all of us.

165
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,170
It's almost new.

166
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,750
I'm so sad.

167
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:32,890
I'm so sad.

168
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,010
I'm so sad.

169
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:35,750
I love Sonic the Hedgehog.

170
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,170
The real April Fools.

171
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,150
The real April Fools.

172
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,990
No fucking free games to play on April Fools.

173
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,810
How is this possible?

174
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,210
So yes.

175
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,090
Anyway, Meddy thank you for the super chat.

176
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,450
Thank you.

177
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,010
Thank you.

178
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,090
I had a ratatouille flashback moment with the intro.

179
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,070
Thank you for the super chat.

180
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,410
Thank you.

181
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,950
Thank you.

182
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,990
Don't worry guys.

183
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,190
In two hours.

184
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,130
I think I scheduled it for two hours.

185
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:09,150
The full intro will be uploaded as a video.

186
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,950
Oh my god, Sonic!

187
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,350
The game was actually developed by the social team.

188
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,690
Oh my god!

189
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,950
America!

190
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,030
Fuck yeah!

191
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,530
Oh my god!

192
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,130
If I can get fact checked by anybody, I'm happy it was Sonic the Hedgehog.

193
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,910
Sonic the Hedgehog!

194
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,730
Where is my sequel?

195
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,290
What happened?

196
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,770
The Sega of America!

197
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,350
I'm happy that... you know what?

198
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,770
I'm not upset that I got actuallyed.

199
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,950
Because I got... who else?

200
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,110
Alright, who else could have got actuallyed by the official team?

201
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,550
The official Sonic the Hedgehog though.

202
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,550
Come on!

203
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,510
I wear that pride.

204
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,970
I wear that with honor.

205
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,590
I don't worry.

206
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,130
What happened?

207
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,910
Sonic!

208
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,770
Did you guys peaked?

209
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,570
You guys fell off!

210
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,710
No!

211
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,830
Oh my god.

212
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,510
Anyway, I'm super... I'm super duper excited to...

213
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,590
Finally play... I have like no...

214
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,610
I have like no actual knowledge of whatever this game is.

215
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:45,750
The only thing I know about this game is that I saw a screenshot of Sonic doing the Yamcha pose.

216
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,410
So that is like literally my only point of knowledge for this game.

217
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,450
Okay, and then I looked at the... Also, by the way, how's the sound by the way?

218
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,330
Um...

219
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,330
Is the... Is the... Is the sound okay?

220
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,210
That's actually crazy though.

221
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,490
Oh my god, Sonic.

222
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,250
I can't believe the official Sonic team is here.

223
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,310
Watching a tomato play this game.

224
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,270
A year late by the way.

225
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,950
Okay, so like I know it's not just a visual novel.

226
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,770
Because, um...

227
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,930
I was looking... Okay, let's see if my sound guy is awake.

228
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:25,850
Uh...

229
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,450
Alright, they're not in my chat.

230
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,590
So I assume they're not awake.

231
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,850
Oh, wait.

232
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,970
They are!

233
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,050
They are in my chat!

234
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,890
Okay, I know that there's more to this.

235
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,030
Because I looked at assist mode.

236
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,510
And why the fuck is there invisibility?

237
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,690
And, uh...

238
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,790
Invincibility?

239
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,890
And then remove pitfalls.

240
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,810
I was like, oh, this is not a regular...

241
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,930
This is not a regular visual novel.

242
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,790
I was just like, this is...

243
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,930
What do you mean?

244
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,070
Pitfalls?

245
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,210
What does this mean?

246
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,750
This is not a regular...

247
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,630
There's a journalist mode.

248
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,230
Why is there a journalist mode in my visual novel?

249
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,790
Anyway...

250
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,150
Um...

251
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,790
Yes, don't mind the knife.

252
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,090
I'm just making my salad.

253
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,750
So, um...

254
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,570
If anybody like...

255
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,950
If anybody gets stabbed...

256
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,430
It wasn't my fault.

257
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,970
They walked into it, okay?

258
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,210
Okay, I'm just saying...

259
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,070
If I start walking around...

260
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,530
Extending my arm out...

261
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,710
Holding a knife...

262
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,570
And like...

263
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,050
I just walk forward...

264
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,650
Is it really my fault if somebody else walks into my knife?

265
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,810
Is it really my fault?

266
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,230
I would say that like...

267
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,390
It would be an act...

268
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,770
It was like their fault for being stupid enough to walk into my knife.

269
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,890
Okay, guys?

270
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,870
Like, how is that my fault?

271
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,250
Like, they could just...

272
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,890
You know, they could just like...

273
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,990
Walk the other way.

274
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,090
Like, oh my god, just turn around.

275
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,150
Hahaha...

276
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,570
What is that red stain?

277
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,890
It's just tomato sauce.

278
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,010
You know?

279
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,150
I was just making a salad.

280
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,170
Alright.

281
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,230
Anyway.

282
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,350
Let's...

283
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,890
Let's fucking play the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

284
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,110
Phew.

285
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,590
Made it on the train 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

286
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,350
So far, so good for my first day on the job.

287
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,430
Oh, I totally forgot my name tag.

288
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,710
Uh...

289
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,490
It isn't ready yet.

290
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,230
I should make...

291
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,850
Wait, is that me?

292
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,590
Is that my Sonic OC?

293
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,570
I'll just...

294
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,690
I'll just sign my name here.

295
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,290
Oh my god!

296
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,330
Hahaha!

297
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,250
Oh my god!

298
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,790
He's red too!

299
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,830
Just like me!

300
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,150
How did they know?

301
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,250
I can't believe it!

302
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,130
That's my official Sonic OC, guys.

303
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,290
Um...

304
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:44,990
Okay.

305
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,470
Doki...

306
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,950
FPS...

307
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,550
VTuber...

308
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,030
TTV...

309
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,770
Oh, wait.

310
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:53,870
Uh...

311
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,130
Okay.

312
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,910
Doki...

313
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,390
Tomato...

314
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,810
FPS...

315
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,950
VTuber...

316
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,530
Okay, there.

317
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,790
There we go.

318
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,290
That feels better.

319
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,130
Alright.

320
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,870
C.I.

321
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,970
Thank you for the Akasupa!

322
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,070
Thank you, thank you!

323
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,430
Doki, I passed my PhD today.

324
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:07,890
Let's go!

325
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,830
Real 90 Roblox!

326
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,170
Thank you for confirming.

327
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,750
Thank you for the Akasupa!

328
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,870
Thank you, thank you!

329
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,910
Doki Mado?

330
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,930
Oh my god, you're right.

331
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,310
I need people to know I'm a VTuber.

332
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,190
I need, like, Doki Mado FPS VTube.

333
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,090
There we go.

334
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,770
I need people to know I'm a VTuber.

335
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,610
Alright.

336
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,550
Doki Mado FPS VTube.

337
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,170
Did I spell that right?

338
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:30,610
Yeah!

339
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,670
Yes.

340
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,750
Oh my god, that's me!

341
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,690
Hope passengers can read my scribble.

342
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,530
I can't believe it.

343
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,350
I'm an official Sonic OC.

344
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,920
Dining car.

345
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,970
Uh oh.

346
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,130
Am I nervous?

347
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,810
Is this first day on the job jitters?

348
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,490
Working the train's dining car can be so...

349
00:15:59,490 --> 00:15:59,710
See?

350
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,870
This is why I have a knife!

351
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,550
I'm a chef!

352
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,590
Come on, Doki Mado FPS VTube.

353
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,310
Shake it off!

354
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,350
Slap.

355
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,690
Doki Mado FPS VTube.

356
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,430
Okay, maybe it was a bad idea to have an incredibly long name.

357
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,950
Doki Mado FPS VTube.

358
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,750
Did I, uh, just see you hitting yourself?

359
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,110
Mr. Conductor, sir.

360
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,970
How are you doing this morning?

361
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,670
Ho ho ho.

362
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,530
Quite alright, my dear.

363
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,910
I'm doing myself, though feeling a little bit bittersweet.

364
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
Is that because you're...

365
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,430
Ha ha ha ha ha!

366
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,490
Guys!

367
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,150
Guys, I need a promotion.

368
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,010
Okay.

369
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,290
I have a family to feed.

370
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,490
The family is me.

371
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,370
Oh, trying to butter me up on the very first day, are we?

372
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,030
Alas, today is my last day as the Conductor.

373
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,350
I'm retiring after 32 wonderful years.

374
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,250
Time for me and the Mirage Express to say goodbye to one another.

375
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,670
Oh, congratulations on retirement, sir!

376
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,850
Thank you.

377
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,330
My wife is...

378
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,390
Oh, he has a...

379
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,090
No, it's okay.

380
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,370
I can be the...

381
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,630
I can be the...

382
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,730
The trading side.

383
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,630
Very excited about it.

384
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,590
She's already got our plane tickets to Spagonia Unlocked.

385
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,330
Oh, Locked.

386
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,030
Our shower's been on the fritz, so I'm excited to use the hotels.

387
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,890
Ha ha!

388
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,250
I can see why his wife's excited.

389
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,930
Enough of my quibbles.

390
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,170
Today is your first day working the dining car.

391
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,250
Here's the menu for today.

392
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,810
Menu added to your inventory.

393
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,770
Oh, I got the menu.

394
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,870
I can open up the inventory at any time to see what's on that menu.

395
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,170
It features Chili Dog Instant Ramen.

396
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,350
And Chicken Cordon Bleu.

397
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,430
I like how Instant Ramen is in there.

398
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,990
It looks so fancy!

399
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,230
Imagine eating like, Instant Ramen at such a fancy VIP.

400
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,930
There's a fucking chandelier!

401
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,130
How is there like, a chandelier in this fucking...

402
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,430
Like, in this train?

403
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,630
I don't know.

404
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,630
I feel like having a chandelier on a moving train seems incredibly fucking dangerous.

405
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:30,850
Um...

406
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,890
Why do you look so nervous?

407
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,950
All we have on the train is a microwave.

408
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,250
Ha ha ha ha!

409
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,110
Though...

410
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,110
I'm sure a little quiz is in order.

411
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,070
A quiz?

412
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,250
Which of these do we serve in the dining car?

413
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,330
Oh.

414
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,070
Chicken...

415
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,670
Oh, I read!

416
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,350
I can...

417
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,630
Guys, for April Fools, the biggest joke right now is that I can read.

418
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,010
Ding ding ding!

419
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,250
Ding!

420
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,270
Glad you can read the menu okay.

421
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,210
Bwahaha!

422
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,070
A little about the vessel.

423
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,990
This is a state of the art, high speed, smart train.

424
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,610
With all the latest gadgets.

425
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,010
The train can really handle anything you throw at it.

426
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,890
But yet we serve Instant Ramen?

427
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,410
We've had a lot of adventures together.

428
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,130
Me and this train.

429
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,710
It's not easy to leave.

430
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,450
After 32 years?

431
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,010
I don't blame it for being wistful.

432
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,650
This train is exclusively used for events.

433
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,190
It's not a passenger train.

434
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,130
All the budget went to the fucking chandelier.

435
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,070
Imagine eating Instant Ramen with champagne and chandeliers.

436
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,470
Ha ha ha ha!

437
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,670
I remember that from the interview.

438
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,550
What's the event today?

439
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,650
A murder mystery party.

440
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,410
Wait, you mean Sonic isn't actually dead?

441
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,030
I got click baited.

442
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,570
Sonic Team!

443
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,250
Ha ha ha ha!

444
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,630
I can't believe he's not actually dead!

445
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,830
What's the point?

446
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,790
What?

447
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,010
Nothing better than some throws to end my tenure as conducted.

448
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,190
Guests will be funneled here to the dining car as a home base, so to speak.

449
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,410
I'll be with you to gather tickets.

450
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,890
But after that, you'll be on your own.

451
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:46,850
So I'll need you to do everything in your power to make sure our paying guests are well taken care of.

452
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,830
Understood?

453
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,550
I can't afford to lose my job.

454
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,430
This is all I have left.

455
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,470
You sure can't.

456
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,650
The severance pay is lousy.

457
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,670
Ha ha ha!

458
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,650
Doors to the Mirage Express are opening.

459
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,310
All aboard!

460
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,090
I can't believe Sonic is actually still alive.

461
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,050
I know!

462
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,310
What the fuck was the point?

463
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,650
Ha ha ha ha!

464
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,810
Why did I bring a knife for?

465
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,930
That's so messed up.

466
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,170
Oh.

467
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:22,950
Amy!

468
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,270
Wow!

469
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,550
Oh, sorry, wait.

470
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,590
Wow!

471
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,010
This train is incredible!

472
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,610
What fascinating tech!

473
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,150
I forgot what Vector sounds like.

474
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,430
He's a gator.

475
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,450
You're right, Dez.

476
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,090
I could get used to staying on a train like this.

477
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,570
What do you expect?

478
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,150
You know, I always go all out for my birthday parties.

479
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,750
Oh shit.

480
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,250
Ha ha ha ha!

481
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,630
Wait.

482
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:00,730
Um.

483
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,590
Ha ha ha ha!

484
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,570
Guys, I could never do, like, Rouge Justice.

485
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,870
Ha ha ha ha!

486
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,970
This train is as elegant as you are, Amy.

487
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,130
I can't promise I won't take anything, though.

488
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,290
Ha ha ha ha!

489
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,110
Oh, wait.

490
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,130
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:22,630
Oh, fuck.

492
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:22,950
I'm like, really?

493
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,590
Fuck, there's so many voices.

494
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,350
Guys, I can't keep up to date with a lot of...

495
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,910
Today I'm a little stupid, so I can't keep up to date with all these voices.

496
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:29,850
Um.

497
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:31,850
Whoa!

498
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,450
Calm down there, Rouge.

499
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,950
Did I not just catch you stealing from the train station gif shop?

500
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,230
Howdy!

501
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,550
Ha ha ha ha!

502
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,530
That was my best country accent!

503
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,850
It was a pen, knucklehead.

504
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,990
Who's gonna miss me?

505
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,270
A teeny, tiny pen.

506
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,110
Oh, I love the directing.

507
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,410
What cast of characters am I stuck with?

508
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,250
Get a hold of yourself, Dokimedo FPSVTube.

509
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,850
You're sweating through your uniform.

510
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,130
Oh shit.

511
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,910
Oh my god!

512
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,310
It's the star!

513
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,090
It's him!

514
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,110
Sonic, are you still here?

515
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,750
That's you!

516
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,630
Oh my god!

517
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,270
That's him!

518
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,230
Okay, the main character!

519
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,910
Wait, let me get into the mindset.

520
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,770
Chilly dogs, chilly dogs.

521
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,150
Chilly dogs, chilly dogs!

522
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,550
Hey pal!

523
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,670
Can I get one of those chilly dogs?

524
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,260
They're both the same answer.

525
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,140
What a lovely day to be alive and...

526
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,220
and not dead.

527
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,400
This is an illusion of choice.

528
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,740
It's literally the same answer.

529
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,340
Okay, radio friend.

530
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,740
Well, aren't you friendly?

531
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,020
Why can't I be normal for one second?

532
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,320
Sonic, wait until I announce everyone's rules to get food.

533
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,560
Sorry about that, birthday girl.

534
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,560
I'll be coming around to collect everyone's tic...

535
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,380
I almost said TikToks.

536
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,280
I'll be coming...

537
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,820
Oh my god, what's wrong with me?

538
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,920
I'll be coming around to collect everyone's tickets.

539
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,500
Please have them out and ready.

540
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,200
You'll join me, Dokimedo FPSVTube, won't you?

541
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,860
Just click on whoever you'd like to talk with and we'll collect their tickets.

542
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,280
Okay, got it.

543
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,540
Alright.

544
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,480
Who are you?

545
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,620
You never introduced yourself.

546
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,340
Oh my god!

547
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,800
This is... this is my actual Sonic OC.

548
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,260
Here.

549
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,660
Thank you.

550
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,060
Everything is in order.

551
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,160
He seems concerned about something.

552
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,140
You know what I wish?

553
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,780
What would be the best gift in the whole wide world?

554
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,300
If they like, re-released the Shadow game where he holds a gun.

555
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,680
I feel like...

556
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,460
Please...

557
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
I don't understand!

558
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,300
Why we don't have...

559
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,040
We have so many remakes.

560
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,760
But not the one where we save the president.

561
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,480
The most important...

562
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,140
We make the most...

563
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,620
The most important game of all.

564
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,760
I wanna fucking be Shadow the Hedgehog and shoot somebody.

565
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,460
Like, I don't understand.

566
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,620
I don't understand why we can't have that.

567
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,420
Why we don't have that.

568
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,860
Is there anything we can help you with?

569
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,080
Hmm...

570
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,760
Do you sell gift bags here?

571
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,400
Um...

572
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,980
No.

573
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,780
Sadly.

574
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,720
But I have a plastic grocery bag in the back I could get for you.

575
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,440
Hmm...

576
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,140
That stare...

577
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,240
Oh, so cold.

578
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,920
Doki made a FPS VTube.

579
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,240
You're shivering.

580
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,340
Do you need me to fetch your jacket?

581
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,240
Oh my gosh, what will your wife think?

582
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,900
Oh, no.

583
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,720
No, I'm good.

584
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,840
He's so cool.

585
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,240
He's so fucking cool.

586
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,220
Okay.

587
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,400
Howdy.

588
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,060
Can I please get your ticket?

589
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,580
I think that's a ticket.

590
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,400
But I really don't want to argue with this guy.

591
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,460
Everything looks good.

592
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,460
Thank you.

593
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,660
Seems the conductor doesn't want to argue either.

594
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,640
Hmm...

595
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,940
Can I get your ticket, young'un?

596
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,500
Right here, sir.

597
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,660
Thank you.

598
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,740
May I offer you any of the snacks we have on board?

599
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,100
No, thank you.

600
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,780
When I travel, I always pack my own Sparkle Gelatin.

601
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
It's a sparkly jelly that can melt any jaded heart.

602
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,500
No way I brought my own Sparkle Gelatin with me too.

603
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,280
It's my first day.

604
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,240
And I was a little nervous.

605
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,980
Oh, my God.

606
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,480
We're going to be best friends, Tails.

607
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,640
Honestly, always be like really good friends with like the smart kid.

608
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,380
Because like they'll always have your...

609
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,660
Because like the reason why is that what if they become a millionaire?

610
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,040
It's like you'll become the millionaire and then you'll always get like very expensive gifts later on.

611
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,560
Also, they're good friends too, by the way.

612
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,440
It's not always about...

613
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,260
Bye.

614
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,480
Bye.

615
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,830
It's not always about the money, you know.

616
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,330
It's not always about the money.

617
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,170
They'll be really good friends.

618
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,030
But also the bonus.

619
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,230
The bonus is that they'll be like, hey, you want that iPhone?

620
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,790
Don't worry, man.

621
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,070
I just got my allowance.

622
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,310
Let me get that for you.

623
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,910
Don't be nervous.

624
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,970
You're doing great so far.

625
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,470
We're Sparkle Gelatin buddies.

626
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,110
Bye.

627
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,330
Unless they become a doctor.

628
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,850
Then they don't make any money.

629
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:25,770
Alright,

630
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,550
let's see.

631
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,250
We'll talk to Sonic last.

632
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,050
A princess such as myself must always be punctual.

633
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,050
Princess?

634
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,310
Did she just say princess?

635
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,930
I actually don't know the lore with her.

636
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:03,410
I think like... I think her and the chameleon... I don't really know much lore about them.

637
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,990
But I think they're like more like the comics, right?

638
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,280
Like...

639
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,540
Um...

640
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,460
Aren't they like... Aren't they like...

641
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
More so like...

642
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,200
Like Sonic comic characters?

643
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,980
Because I don't know much about Blaze or...

644
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,680
Or...

645
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,360
The Iguana Kid.

646
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,800
Or Gator.

647
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,440
It don't mean I'm asking.

648
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,420
Are you visiting from somewhere?

649
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,800
A separate dimension actually.

650
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,740
A separate what?

651
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,900
Just here for Amy's birthday.

652
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,460
Then I'll hop back to my own dimension.

653
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,460
They're not comic characters.

654
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,140
Wait, which... Which game are they from?

655
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,340
I quite prefer the birthday cake from this world more than on my own.

656
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,560
I'm exci... I meant I'm a bit excited.

657
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,420
Ho ho ho!

658
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,860
You don't say.

659
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,220
Well, I hope you enjoy your stay princess.

660
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,620
Many games.

661
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,440
I like how the Sonic 06 and the Sonic Rush people are fighting each other right now.

662
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,060
And I'm just like who's she?

663
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,600
Should I bow?

664
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,360
Do I bow before the princess?

665
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,220
What are you doing?

666
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,920
Please.

667
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,420
Get up.

668
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,540
Why can I not win with this group?

669
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,580
Alright, let's see.

670
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,720
Who's he?

671
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,600
She?

672
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,350
He?

673
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,400
Could we please see your ticket?

674
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,800
Of course.

675
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,780
Excellent.

676
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,540
Thank you.

677
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
And I hope you enjoy your stay with us.

678
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,420
Absolutely.

679
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,920
I appreciate it.

680
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,440
There's a calmness about...

681
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
Oh, he was super calm.

682
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,860
Sorry, I was...

683
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,400
I have no idea who this person is.

684
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,340
I just knew he was a chameleon.

685
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,160
There's a calmness about him.

686
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,240
Something about his presence puts me at ease.

687
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,440
Do you consider me calming?

688
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,840
He's looking right at me.

689
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,180
I study ninjutsu.

690
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,500
I believe one can communicate through the subconscious.

691
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,200
Fucking nerd.

692
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
Wow, ninjutsu?

693
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,640
That sounds like a lot of difficult training.

694
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,560
Can you cling on to walls?

695
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,160
Cling on to walls?

696
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,140
What kind of question is that?

697
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,100
We...

698
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,160
We...

699
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,220
We...

700
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,640
I must certainly can.

701
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,640
The conductor looks a bit too smug at that answer.

702
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,240
Who else are you missing?

703
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,080
Oh no, Gator.

704
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,320
Hello, my friend.

705
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,700
Can I get your ticket?

706
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,720
Yeah, of course.

707
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,340
As a gentleman of upsetting morals, I love to show you my...

708
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

709
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,780
Maybe not.

710
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,220
Maybe put that down.

711
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,720
Don't need to show me your ticket, man.

712
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,100
Farewell.

713
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,520
Get out.

714
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,280
Don't you worry.

715
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,580
We'll take a look around for you and see if it turns up.

716
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,260
That would be amazing.

717
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,520
Thanks a million.

718
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,900
Seems as though we should keep our eyes peeled for his ticket.

719
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,040
Get out.

720
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,320
Paying customers only.

721
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,160
Can I please get the birthday girl's ticket?

722
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,820
Why certainly.

723
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,820
Oh shit.

724
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,860
I don't know what he said.

725
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,060
Well, the birthday discount certainly helped.

726
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,960
It must not have been important.

727
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,420
Who doesn't love a good bargain?

728
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,900
And a murder mystery train?

729
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,240
Just sounds so exciting.

730
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,520
It's right out of my alley.

731
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,380
Who doesn't love a good thrill?

732
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,720
You see, I'm a girl who loves a good truth.

733
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:44,800
I'm a girl who loves a good truth.

734
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm a girl who loves a good crime.

735
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,220
Oh no.

736
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,580
She's one of those people.

737
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,160
Maybe I should leave her to have fun.

738
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,680
Before we move along for you...

739
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,300
Before we move along for you, miss.

740
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,440
Oh, have fun!

741
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,240
Thank you!

742
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,460
Where do I use this?

743
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,980
That unlocks any door on the train.

744
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,180
Happy birthday!

745
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,120
The birthday girl gets the birthday key.

746
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,780
It's practically traditional.

747
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,060
Wait, the birthday girl gets to cheat?

748
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,700
That's not fair!

749
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,520
Why the fuck does she get to play on journalist mode?

750
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,080
And I actually have to try.

751
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,420
Very useful.

752
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,660
Well used this wisely.

753
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,540
Thank you!

754
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,960
Alright.

755
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,520
Fuck.

756
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,220
Okay, rouge.

757
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,520
Oh, fuck.

758
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:35,860
Okay.

759
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,360
Well, hello, YouTube.

760
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,480
Okay.

761
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,080
Sorry.

762
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,020
Well, hello, YouTube.

763
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,680
What can I do for you?

764
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,480
Good morning, ma'am.

765
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,200
Can we get your ticket?

766
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,520
My, my.

767
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,200
How forward.

768
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,000
Let me fetch it for you.

769
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,040
Wait, is it like in her...

770
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,940
Where did she... Where did she get it?

771
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,080
Come back if you need anything.

772
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,360
Anything else?

773
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,160
You hear?

774
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,120
Wow, she's so polite.

775
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,620
Very easy to talk to as well.

776
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,360
Ma'am, I saw you sneak that $20 bill out of my pocket.

777
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:30,880
Wait, what?

778
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,840
He has a wife!

779
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,600
And a...

780
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,300
And he already has a side...

781
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,920
He already has a train wife too.

782
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,100
And he already has a train wife too.

783
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,140
Gonna have to kindly ask for that back.

784
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,600
Oh, this was yours?

785
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,260
Must have slipped out.

786
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,580
Here you go.

787
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,600
I may not actually be the best at judging characters.

788
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,960
Alright, Sonic's the last...

789
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,580
ticket, please.

790
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,880
Oh wait, sorry, that's conductor.

791
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,700
I thought that was...

792
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,420
Thank you kindly.

793
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,520
Happy that someone as renowned as yourself aboard.

794
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,120
Huh?

795
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,960
Don't worry about it.

796
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,760
I just like helping.

797
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,120
When Eggman took over, I truly feared the worst.

798
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,280
But my kids swore you would swoop in eventually.

799
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,960
And you did!

800
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,140
I can't offer much other than my sincere gratitude.

801
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,240
Don't sweat a thing.

802
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,800
I'm glad you and your family are safe.

803
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,760
Wait a minute.

804
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,180
Is he...

805
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,840
Is he Sonic the Hedgehog?

806
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,240
Okay, to be fair, how many other blue hedgehogs out there?

807
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,100
How the fuck did I not know this was Sonic?

808
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,600
If I didn't know it was Sonic, I should have known by Amy Tale's shadow.

809
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,380
And now I'm like, whoa, there's Amy Tale.

810
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,120
I wonder who this blue hedgehog is.

811
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,040
Oh my god!

812
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,840
I can't believe that's Sonic the Hedgehog!

813
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,100
I promise you an excellent stay on our train.

814
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,820
How many blue hedgehogs are fucking in this world anyway?

815
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,000
Sonic, have fun now.

816
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,120
Sonic, have fun now.

817
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,440
Yes!

818
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,140
Have fun!

819
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:43,740
Have fun now!

820
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,740
Will do!

821
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,600
Thanks!

822
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,740
Oh wait, there's one more.

823
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,900
That's not a character.

824
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,060
Mmm, yum.

825
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,660
Ha ha!

826
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,720
Mmm, yummy!

827
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,540
Don't mind if I do.

828
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,920
Dokimedo FPS VTube.

829
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,120
Those are for our guests, you know.

830
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:10,120
Train, be sure Dokimedo FPS VTube only gets one of those if they ask.

831
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,440
Hmm.

832
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,720
Okay.

833
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,340
You're like what about like, there's...

834
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,940
There's metal Sonic.

835
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,340
Yes!

836
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,840
He's made of metal!

837
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,920
Like, he's fucking metal!

838
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,180
The Sonic's not made of metal!

839
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,720
The arms just kinda not?

840
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,180
Actually, uh, Train.

841
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,280
The conductor wants me to have the whole plate.

842
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:37,960
Hmm.

843
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,220
Ha ha ha!

844
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,560
Good try, young boss.

845
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,140
What about my OC?

846
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,620
Jeremiah the blue hedgehog who looks just like Sonic.

847
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,880
Did I talk to everybody?

848
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,200
Oh wait, what's this?

849
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,360
What's sticking out the napkin holder?

850
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,720
Oh, it's the Gator's ticket!

851
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,600
Say, wasn't someone looking for that ticket earlier?

852
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,300
Let's be sure to return this to its rightful owner.

853
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,120
Alright, let's make sure no one uses their ticket as a napkin.

854
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,260
Alright, hello!

855
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,900
I found your ticket.

856
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,320
Yeah, we might just have what you need.

857
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,020
Donky Medoh FPS VTube, why don't you show our friend here what we picked up?

858
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,060
Look, I found a menu.

859
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,880
Oh, I'm starved!

860
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,100
I'll take one of each!

861
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,400
On second thought, maybe I'll wait a bit.

862
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,700
Donky Medoh FPS VTube, I was referring to the other thing we picked up.

863
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,860
Oh, right, sorry!

864
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,480
Oh no, maybe they're hungry!

865
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,880
If they want to order food, they'll have to pay for it and then we get more money, right?

866
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,500
Can I?

867
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,760
Oh, it's the same thing.

868
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay.

869
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,420
I was gonna say, would he call me stupid if I do it again?

870
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,640
Ah!

871
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,720
Here it is!

872
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,240
That's my ticket!

873
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,960
Thanks so much to you both!

874
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,300
Was really worried you'd kick me out and I missed the murder mystery!

875
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,300
Oh, oh!

876
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,260
Old Donky Medoh FPS VTube!

877
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,680
Here we'll have their hands full kicking you out!

878
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,900
You're right!

879
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,820
I wouldn't leave without a fight!

880
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,740
Ha ha ha ha!

881
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,180
Whoa!

882
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,800
Wait, who made me both microwave expert and security guard?

883
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,540
Wait, am I the only staff here?

884
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,040
Other than the train?

885
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,940
Where are the other people?

886
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,280
Wait a minute.

887
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,500
Where are the other Sonic OCs?

888
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,140
You're both all right in my book!

889
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,120
Thanks again for the assist!

890
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,980
This is like the most unrealistic thing.

891
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,600
There only being one self-insert Sonic OC.

892
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,560
Of course!

893
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,720
Just let us know if you need anything else!

894
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,760
Okay everyone!

895
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,260
Time for me to read out everyone's rules for the murder mystery!

896
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,500
And that's my cue to leave!

897
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,200
I must prepare the driver's compartment for departure!

898
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,860
Ah, the conductor's car.

899
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,140
You remember our promise, yeah?

900
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:50,700
You'll do everything in your power to make sure our guests have a safe and enjoyable time on the Mirage Express!

901
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,260
Absolutely!

902
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,920
You can count on me!

903
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,960
The one person, you know, in charge!

904
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,040
On the first day!

905
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,300
For a celebrity!

906
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,980
And train?

907
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:13,140
Assist Dokimedo FPS VTube if they need any help, won't you?

908
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,980
This is my self-insert Sonic OC fanfiction.

909
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,660
That's all I need to hear.

910
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,040
You have my trust.

911
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,060
Nothing more heartwarming than a conductor and his train.

912
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,220
Just me and my train wife.

913
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,540
Excellent!

914
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,700
I'll be off.

915
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,480
I must take my leave, everyone.

916
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,260
Please, have a phenomenal time!

917
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,900
And don't worry about mucking up the place's otter.

918
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,500
This train is state of the art and our systems were dealing with all of that.

919
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:58,380
For everything else, please talk to Dokimedo FPS VTube here if you need anything else.

920
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,300
Sounds good!

921
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,300
Absolutely!

922
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,600
Okay, wait, they sound the same now.

923
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,740
Oh no.

924
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,580
I made Tails and Sonic sound the same and I didn't realize.

925
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,700
Because I can only do three voices.

926
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,500
Okay.

927
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,320
Absolutely!

928
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,060
Will do!

929
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,640
Okay, bye now!

930
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,640
I like that guy!

931
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,000
Thank you all for following the outfit guide.

932
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,600
I sent you.

933
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,820
You all look...

934
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,900
Oh yeah, by the way, do you guys know like Mirage from Apex voices Sonic the Hedgehog?

935
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,780
I sent you.

936
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,000
You all look amazing!

937
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,640
I trust you all read your lore cards as well?

938
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,260
Lore cards?

939
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,700
That must be the details of their motivations.

940
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,280
I suppose it makes sense.

941
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,800
Lore cards aren't read out loud otherwise people will know the murderer's intentions.

942
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,320
Yeah!

943
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,340
You guys didn't know that?

944
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,040
It's the same voice actor.

945
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,080
Now, on to the nitty gritty for the murder mystery game.

946
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,200
One of you will be murdered and the rest are suspects.

947
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,660
Man, I wonder who's going to be murdered in the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

948
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,800
Everyone has assigned roles for characters they will be playing.

949
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,020
Participation is required.

950
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,400
For it is my birthday!

951
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,990
Of course!

952
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,270
Birthday girl makes the rules!

953
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:47,370
Sonic, you are a ship captain and you'll be stationed in the conductor car.

954
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,950
Naturally, that's where the captain would go.

955
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,530
Tails, you are the detective.

956
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,770
You'll be here in the dining car.

957
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:00,930
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

958
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,850
You'll be here in the dining car, too.

959
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,430
I'll wait for you.

960
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,310
I'm sorry.

961
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:20,170
You'll be here in the dining car.

962
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,230
Exactly.

963
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,290
I'll wait for you.

964
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,190
I'll wait for you.

965
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,010
Your birthday in the lived room.

966
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:29,630
I'm sure you're ready.

967
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,080
What?

968
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,800
It's a train!

969
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,600
No wonder he's... Okay, now I understand why he's a cowboy.

970
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:00,260
Sounds fun.

971
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,920
Wait, why the fuck is the butcher in the library?

972
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,320
Wouldn't the butcher be in the dining car?

973
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,540
This doesn't make sense, Amy.

974
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,520
You already fucked it up.

975
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,520
Like, all the other ones fit!

976
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,360
Why the fuck is the butcher in the library?

977
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,800
Oh my god.

978
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,240
I'm cooking.

979
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,980
This is my self-insert fanfiction.

980
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,380
Very educated butcher.

981
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,840
Both found in the library.

982
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,540
Hear that, Espio?

983
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,500
We get to hang out together!

984
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,940
And do what?

985
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,960
Yeah, what are we going to do?

986
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,660
Reeeeeeeend?

987
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,240
Maybe we can make a tower of books or something.

988
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,000
Yeah, books.

989
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,860
Shadow is the locksmith hanging out in the looom.

990
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,120
And last but not least, me!

991
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,780
I'm the locksmith!

992
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,420
The Dreadless Reporter!

993
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,500
I'll be moseying around with everyone!

994
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,200
Did you get all that?

995
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,520
Yeah, a tower made of... books.

996
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,460
Did it have the April Fools?

997
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,220
Oh my god, actual dreadless mode!

998
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,760
Oh my god, she's actually...

999
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,760
oh my god!

1000
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,960
She's actually a Dreadless!

1001
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,600
Don't worry, I'll do your...

1002
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,540
Don't worry, I'll do your decimal.

1003
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,100
Will she re...

1004
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,800
No, okay, I don't want her to repeat that.

1005
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,880
I was listening!

1006
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,600
Hope that's okay.

1007
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,040
Stop!

1008
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,860
More than alright!

1009
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,160
You can help ensure everyone's following their rules!

1010
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,800
Ugh, that reminds me!

1011
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,540
Oh shit, thank god I have a map.

1012
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,780
I have a map for each of you!

1013
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,720
Everyone's station is marked on the map as well.

1014
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,600
How convenient!

1015
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,480
Map added to my inventory.

1016
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,660
Oh thank god, it won't get lost.

1017
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,520
Okay guys, I don't need you guys to help me remember.

1018
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,340
I have a map.

1019
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,740
The rules of the game are as follows.

1020
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,480
There is a murder amongst you all.

1021
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,060
The murder can kill a single participant, however they choose.

1022
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,980
But you must physically be present with the victim for it to count.

1023
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,580
Everyone else must collect evidence throughout the train and use it to integrate.

1024
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,720
Interrogate fellow passengers to figure out who's done it.

1025
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,020
The murder will lie to get out of being accused.

1026
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,740
The murder will lie to get out of being accused.

1027
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,980
So inspect everything you can.

1028
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,700
Find clues.

1029
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,180
And interrogate.

1030
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,460
Oh my god, it's like Phoenix Wright in Among Us.

1031
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,920
I'll set a timer for you.

1032
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,760
One hour.

1033
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,480
So everyone can mingle and the murder can do their thing.

1034
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,280
Is everyone ready?

1035
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,120
Yeah!

1036
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,280
Let's play!

1037
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,880
Sounds like everyone's excited!

1038
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:55,640
Yeah!

1039
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,520
Stop, stop.

1040
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,480
Everyone at your stations!

1041
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,060
Alright.

1042
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,500
Let's find some clues.

1043
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,720
Can someone die yet?

1044
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,760
Ah, this is so exciting!

1045
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,100
A mystery is unfolding right under our very noses!

1046
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,100
How thrilling!

1047
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,840
I know, it's kinda scary!

1048
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,960
Oh man, I'm...

1049
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,220
Oh man, I'm nervous too!

1050
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,540
Shouldn't you two be out here mingling with everyone?

1051
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:32,640
Shouldn't you two be out here mingling with everyone?

1052
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,460
Yeah, detective, do your fucking job!

1053
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,960
Who hired this kid to be a detective?

1054
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,760
He's a child!

1055
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:44,100
Well, actually, the detective and the journalist can't be the murderer.

1056
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,200
Wait, why can't they?

1057
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,120
They can fucking kill if they want to.

1058
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,440
Like, I think killing as a detective is like the perfect alibi.

1059
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,600
They can't arrest me if I'm the law.

1060
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,000
So we're stuck here for an hour before going out and scoping the place.

1061
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,880
This way, there's always a neutral party.

1062
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,620
Makes sense to me.

1063
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,300
Seems as though Amy's more excited about deciphering the mystery anyway.

1064
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,280
What do you think everyone's doing?

1065
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,260
I don't know, murder?

1066
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,700
Except for the people in the library, they're doing something else.

1067
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,960
Oh, probably inspecting their stations and talking amongst one another.

1068
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,400
Everyone has a role to play.

1069
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,380
So they must be exploring their characters.

1070
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,120
So they must be exploring their characters.

1071
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,580
Do you know what their character motivations are, Amy?

1072
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:42,200
Do you know what their character motivations are, Amy?

1073
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,620
No, the lore cards are confidential.

1074
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:45,540
No, the lore cards are confidential.

1075
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,620
No one knows but the person who received them.

1076
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:47,640
No one knows but the person who received them.

1077
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,860
Wait, but who made the lore cards?

1078
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,900
I thought you made it, Amy.

1079
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,160
Didn't you distribute them?

1080
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,760
Oh, what's this?

1081
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,300
Wait, I thought we're not supposed to know your lore tales.

1082
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,220
Oh my god, minus one RP.

1083
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:08,860
My backstory is that I was best friends with a flickie that decided to join the evil Dr. Eggman.

1084
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,140
Kickstarting my desire for justice in the world.

1085
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,260
My lore is that I'm a nosy person turned a journalist.

1086
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,320
She's so happy about that.

1087
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,440
Not gonna lie, that kinda sounds fun.

1088
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,200
Not gonna lie, that kinda sounds fun.

1089
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,420
I wish I wasn't stuck on microwave duty.

1090
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,120
Huh?

1091
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,660
Huh?

1092
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,040
The train started moving!

1093
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,760
It's so fast!

1094
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,440
Grab onto something!

1095
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,400
What is going on?

1096
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,100
Wait, a train isn't supposed to move?

1097
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,060
It's a fucking train.

1098
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,300
I'm slipping!

1099
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,720
Hold on!

1100
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,380
I can't!

1101
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,800
What would be a shame if that chandelier fell?

1102
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,860
AHHHHHHHHH!

1103
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,300
Plus one RP for me.

1104
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,660
I'm so immersed.

1105
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,220
Guys, am I immersing you?

1106
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,660
Nooooo!

1107
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,750
Oh shit, don't worry.

1108
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,170
Insurance covers all of this.

1109
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,510
Wait, you're...

1110
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,570
Wait, what?

1111
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,430
This isn't a dining car!

1112
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,230
Who moved this here?

1113
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:33,930
It's like...

1114
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,710
Oh my god!

1115
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,010
It's just like...

1116
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,190
It's as if I'm on the train right now!

1117
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,230
You're both awake!

1118
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,030
Yeah!

1119
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,670
It seems the train has slowed down considerably.

1120
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,490
Wow, how exhilarating!

1121
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,070
I know!

1122
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,170
The production on this train is outstanding!

1123
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,790
It's definitely more intense than I expected.

1124
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,590
I got a concussion!

1125
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:02,670
I'm so tired!

1126
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,850
I got a concussion and then we all got knocked out!

1127
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,670
And now I have a concussion and we're here now!

1128
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,970
So immersive!

1129
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:13,930
It seems we've been knocked into the dining car's closet.

1130
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,450
This train can't reach such incredible speeds!

1131
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,610
We're getting our money's worth with this experience!

1132
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,990
That's for sure!

1133
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,590
Is this actually intended?

1134
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,230
This is my first day, so...

1135
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,670
I'm not really sure.

1136
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,150
I don't recall them warning me about this in the interview.

1137
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,290
You know I'm getting paid minimum wage for this too.

1138
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,230
That's the worst part.

1139
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,250
We should go check on the others!

1140
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,450
Doki Mato FPSV Tube!

1141
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,790
Could you get the door?

1142
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,650
Of course!

1143
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,370
Getting the door.

1144
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:54,530
Hmm.

1145
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,830
Seems the- Oh shit, really?

1146
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:57,850
I wonder by what?

1147
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,890
It seems the door is blocked!

1148
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,670
I'm not sure.

1149
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,990
I don't think it's budging.

1150
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:04,710
Oh shit!

1151
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:07,550
What the fuck could be blocking the door?

1152
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,830
It can't be this fucking bookcase in front of me!

1153
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,530
It can't be this fucking bookcase in front of me!

1154
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,330
No...

1155
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:13,430
No...

1156
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,790
No...

1157
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,050
Idiot!

1158
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,830
Wait, am I actually- Oh my god!

1159
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,210
I'm so fucking dumb!

1160
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,310
Bro!

1161
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,530
My Sonic OC is actually so stupid!

1162
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,650
I'm- It was actually the fucking shelf!

1163
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,810
That's blocking the door that's in front of me!

1164
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:36,530
Okay.

1165
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:37,610
Alright.

1166
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,670
The Sonic OC reflects the streamer.

1167
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:41,810
Um...

1168
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,930
Idiot!

1169
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,030
Give that falling shelf a whack!

1170
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:46,650
With your pico pico hammer!

1171
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,330
Hmm.

1172
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:50,930
Huh?

1173
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,970
Let's find another way out.

1174
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:55,670
I'll uh...

1175
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,170
Start looking for clues!

1176
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,310
I'll start looking for clues!

1177
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,030
I'll search over here!

1178
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,270
She did it!

1179
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,330
She's not the red heron!

1180
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:06,310
She did it!

1181
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:09,350
You thought she was a- You thought she can't be the murderer!

1182
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:10,690
But she did it!

1183
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,430
Sus!

1184
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,510
It's always the first person!

1185
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,350
I know Amy.

1186
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,850
She's hiding something.

1187
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:25,790
Huh?

1188
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:29,050
I suppose she did wake up before us.

1189
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,010
Something could have happened.

1190
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,310
Listen.

1191
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:35,730
I know I'm the detective here.

1192
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:36,670
But...

1193
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,950
All the best detectives have sidekicks.

1194
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,010
And I'm gonna need your help.

1195
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,190
I'm gonna be Watson!

1196
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:50,530
Let's gather clues on why Amy's acting this way.

1197
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,490
And interrogate her about it.

1198
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,770
Check out everything you can around the world.

1199
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:59,750
And then we'll show it to Amy.

1200
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,850
To uncover the full situation.

1201
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,550
Gather evidence and interrogate.

1202
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:06,250
Got it.

1203
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,430
We're gonna pull a phoenix right on her.

1204
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,190
What's this?

1205
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,350
I'll need you to do everything in your power.

1206
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,810
To make sure our paying guests are well taken care of.

1207
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,070
Understood?

1208
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:21,590
Understood!

1209
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:23,730
Alright.

1210
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,570
I guess I gotta act.

1211
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:25,750
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1212
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,150
You can count on me, Tez.

1213
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,110
Don't worry.

1214
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,630
I'll make sure you'll have a great murder mystery party.

1215
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,870
While I get paid minimum wage.

1216
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,310
On my first day.

1217
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,610
I won't turn evil like your ex-flicky companion did.

1218
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,910
I won't turn evil like your ex-flicky companion did.

1219
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:43,430
I won't turn evil like your ex-flicky companion did.

1220
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,210
Happa to hear it!

1221
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,950
Now let's get searching!

1222
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:48,730
Now let's get searching!

1223
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,130
Awfully sweaty over there.

1224
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,370
Pretty suspicious.

1225
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,570
Something is always hidden in the trash.

1226
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,770
Let's check there.

1227
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,090
Sadly it's empty.

1228
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,490
But on the bright side.

1229
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,090
This is a very clean trash bin.

1230
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:12,510
How did I become as optimistic as a kid?

1231
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,510
Because he's a child.

1232
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:18,250
They haven't realized how fucked up the real world is.

1233
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,430
Oh to be a child again.

1234
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,750
What do you think Tez?

1235
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,770
Want me to cook any of this for you?

1236
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,950
When we get out of here?

1237
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:31,370
Sure!

1238
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,850
I normally never make microwave meals.

1239
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,990
I prefer to cook.

1240
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,370
My cast iron...

1241
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:38,910
Oh my god.

1242
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,930
Who let this child cook?

1243
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,550
My cast iron skillet has gotten a lot of use lately.

1244
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,590
I can cook a mean cast iron pizza.

1245
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:48,410
I can cook a mean cast iron pizza.

1246
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,690
I've only had mic...

1247
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:52,110
Oh...

1248
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,010
I'm so poor.

1249
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,970
I haven't had microwave lunches this week.

1250
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,730
Alright, let's see.

1251
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,470
Ah!

1252
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,170
The wet floor sign!

1253
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,190
Keeping people alert and safe.

1254
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,570
I'm on the college diet right now.

1255
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,670
Once I slipped on some spilled juice at the grocery store.

1256
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,710
No wet floor sign at all!

1257
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,170
Luckily, Sonic was there to catch me.

1258
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,090
My hero!

1259
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:22,650
Wow.

1260
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,150
Sonic really is as fast as they say.

1261
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,670
But he was going so fast.

1262
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:29,610
He also slipped on the juice.

1263
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:33,910
We slid into an older gentleman's shopping cart.

1264
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,550
Shredding me.

1265
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:37,590
Well...

1266
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,770
It's the thought that counts, I suppose.

1267
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,610
Super Persona!

1268
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:42,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1269
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:42,710
Thank you.

1270
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,370
Yo, I didn't know you liked Dangan...

1271
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,130
I actually love Danganronpa!

1272
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,830
I fucking love Danganronpa, man!

1273
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,910
I have so many actual like...

1274
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,130
Danganronpa... sorry.

1275
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,190
Not immersing anyone in it.

1276
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:58,310
Sorry, we're gonna be out of immersive mood right now.

1277
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,710
But like, I actually fucking love that show.

1278
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,010
And I love the game as well.

1279
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,310
And I have like so many Monokuma merch and stuff.

1280
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,310
Because I love Monokuma.

1281
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:12,050
Because the original voice actor for Monokuma was Doraemon.

1282
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,570
And I fucking love her work.

1283
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:17,710
But yeah, sorry.

1284
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,330
Back to immersion!

1285
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:25,750
The shelf blocking our exit is currently not possible.

1286
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,190
So we're not budging.

1287
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:27,850
Hey!

1288
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,950
Doki made a FPS VTube!

1289
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,850
Look closely at this.

1290
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,110
Wait...

1291
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,550
Is that from the...

1292
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,670
Wait, that could be the hammer!

1293
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:41,410
From the something something hammer!

1294
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,250
The Piku Piku hammer?

1295
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:47,250
I wonder how this side of the shelf got smashed.

1296
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,530
There's nothing this shelf could have fallen into.

1297
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,490
I'm not sure this damage wasn't here before.

1298
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,250
The chain has too much upkeep.

1299
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,710
I feel like this is important.

1300
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,630
We should log it.

1301
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,110
Check on the... crack on the shelf is added to the...

1302
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,030
inventory.

1303
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,410
I'm pretty sure like Amy like fucking whacked this shelf.

1304
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,590
To lock us in or something.

1305
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:13,730
What?

1306
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:14,730
What's this?

1307
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,010
A rod?

1308
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,250
Wait, is this...

1309
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,630
Wait, that's the hammer!

1310
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,050
It broke!

1311
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,950
The tip is broken.

1312
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,470
It looks like...

1313
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:24,670
It looks like...

1314
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,490
It's originally been attached to something.

1315
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:30,330
I'm not sure if it's related to our mystery.

1316
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,370
But I like spinning it around.

1317
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:33,290
So we'll keep it.

1318
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,850
The stick is added to your inventory.

1319
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,190
Yeah, this is the hammer!

1320
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,190
It's Amy's hammer!

1321
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,450
I think we found enough clues.

1322
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,530
Let's go interrogate Amy.

1323
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,910
And find what really happened.

1324
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,370
Alright Amy, I got you!

1325
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,450
What's the latest?

1326
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:50,010
Oh my god, I never even talked to her before.

1327
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,450
The game is up.

1328
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:55,490
I'm on my foot now Amy!

1329
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,050
Find any clues yet?

1330
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,410
I found a spoon!

1331
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,530
If we find two more, we can dig ourselves out!

1332
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,690
Dig ourselves out?

1333
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,110
On a train?

1334
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:11,810
Amy, you stupid bitch.

1335
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,370
Okay, that went like Newgrounds real quick.

1336
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:17,310
Uh...

1337
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,670
I'll keep looking.

1338
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,630
Alright, start... wait.

1339
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:22,670
What do I want to talk to?

1340
01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:23,750
Find any clues?

1341
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,490
Yeah, that's me calling her stupid.

1342
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,990
Uh... start interrogation.

1343
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:29,650
Amy!

1344
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,570
We believe you're hiding something from us!

1345
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:34,750
What?

1346
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,710
You accuse me?

1347
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,990
On my own birthday?

1348
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,990
How dare you!

1349
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,790
How dare you!

1350
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:45,570
This isn't going to be easy, is it?

1351
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:46,450
This isn't going to be easy, is it?

1352
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:47,210
It's my birthday!

1353
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:52,150
I've been stuck in here just like the two of you!

1354
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,190
What in the world do you think I'm hiding?

1355
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:00,110
Amy was awake before Tails and I were...

1356
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,210
What could she have done in that time?

1357
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,410
Oh no, what could she have done in that time?

1358
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:05,670
Okay.

1359
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:07,910
Microwave...

1360
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:09,190
Okay.

1361
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:12,630
Microwave the chili dog.

1362
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:13,930
I told you!

1363
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,990
I'm not eating until it's birthday cake time!

1364
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,990
Let me think through this again.

1365
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,750
Amy was awake before...

1366
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:25,110
Wait, I can just say all the wrong answers.

1367
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:26,350
Like...

1368
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,650
There's no stakes involved!

1369
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:31,950
Okay, attempted to...

1370
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:32,330
Okay.

1371
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:33,810
Attempted to escape?

1372
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:36,750
Why would she break the fucking...

1373
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:38,490
The bookshelves?

1374
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:43,290
I don't think you're stealing Ali while Dokimedo, FPSVTube, and I were knocked out.

1375
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,070
You attempted to escape the closet.

1376
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,430
Prove it!

1377
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:49,950
Huh?

1378
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:55,210
Show more evidence that I attempted to escape or help me search for a way out.

1379
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,070
Do we have evidence to prove that?

1380
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:00,710
Dokimedo, FPSVTube.

1381
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,970
Let me step you through this.

1382
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,490
First, find the correct piece of evidence from your inventory.

1383
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,230
You mean the only two evidence that I have?

1384
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:15,670
Once that has been deduced, we must form our arguments to fight back.

1385
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,410
Alright, let's do it.

1386
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:23,050
What proves Amy attempted to escape the dining car closet?

1387
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,830
Okay, there's this.

1388
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:26,290
The stick.

1389
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:27,750
Which is her hammer.

1390
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:29,810
Hmm...

1391
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,090
Let's get... wait, what?

1392
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,550
I mean, you need the stick to hit the shelf!

1393
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:38,950
Oh, I guess like the order goes with shelf first and then...

1394
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,890
And then like, she'll be like, but what did I use to escape?

1395
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:44,830
And then I'll be like, the hammer!

1396
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:47,570
What?

1397
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:48,410
Sorry!

1398
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,790
Some damage on the shelf is supposed to prove something.

1399
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:53,790
It fell over.

1400
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,650
Damage makes sense.

1401
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,410
Hmm...

1402
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,390
You don't have no argument there.

1403
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,770
You're just grasping.

1404
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:05,290
Oh, okay Tails, what now?

1405
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,950
Well, now we need to follow this train of thought.

1406
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,030
How does the crack on the shelf relate to Amy?

1407
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:13,010
I don't know.

1408
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:15,810
What other possible evidence do I have?

1409
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:16,970
Oh, wait.

1410
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,230
I had two.

1411
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:21,490
So now I have to explain myself.

1412
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:27,690
See, uh, well, uh, when I get stumped, I like to think.

1413
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,930
What would...

1414
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:33,170
Okay, Sonic would not be thinking.

1415
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,650
What would Sonic do?

1416
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,810
What would Sonic do?

1417
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,650
Sonic's a force to be reckoned with.

1418
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,750
He's always running for it.

1419
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,130
Collecting rings.

1420
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:50,030
Crushing bad.

1421
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,470
He never loses.

1422
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,610
Like an endless runner game.

1423
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,530
I play a lot of this on my phone.

1424
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:00,910
Oh my God.

1425
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,710
He's a TikTok kid.

1426
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:03,810
He's an iPad kid.

1427
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:04,830
Sure.

1428
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,610
Whatever works.

1429
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,330
Just close your eyes and think.

1430
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:14,750
What would Sonic do?

1431
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,970
And find your argument.

1432
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:21,430
Well, Sonic could just like, I don't know, run through the door.

1433
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:26,450
Like, couldn't Sonic just break through the door with a sheer speed force?

1434
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:27,810
All right.

1435
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,790
Let's prove we're not grasping.

1436
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:34,950
Let's follow the train of thought and fire a comeback like Sonic would do.

1437
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:36,550
Think.

1438
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,470
Oh my God.

1439
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:39,690
Oh, wait.

1440
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,230
What the fuck?

1441
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:41,670
Wait.

1442
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:44,250
Okay.

1443
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:45,750
All right.

1444
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,830
What would Sonic do?

1445
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,010
Yes, I'm ready.

1446
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,750
What do you mean?

1447
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,870
What else do I need to press?

1448
01:06:58,970 --> 01:06:59,450
Yes.

1449
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:00,970
Yes.

1450
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:02,850
Okay.

1451
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:03,790
All right.

1452
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:04,170
Here we go.

1453
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,250
All right.

1454
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,310
Time to collect those rings.

1455
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,290
Oh my God.

1456
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,670
I zoomed in out of accident.

1457
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,630
I'm sorry.

1458
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:11,650
I'm sorry.

1459
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,950
I zoomed that out.

1460
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,730
Oh my God.

1461
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,490
Oh my God.

1462
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:23,390
I got so embarrassed.

1463
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:23,830
It's because it was me.

1464
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:24,730
It's because I'm playing the video game.

1465
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,850
They gave me a video game so I zoomed in.

1466
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:39,950
Give me a sec.

1467
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,570
I'm locked in.

1468
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,250
I'm locked in give me a sec.

1469
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,510
Okay, all right here we go.

1470
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:55,570
All right, I'm back.

1471
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:57,990
I'm back now.

1472
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,130
I'm a little bit bigger though.

1473
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,050
Wait.

1474
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:02,770
Yeah, I'm really... whoa.

1475
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:02,950
Whoa.

1476
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:11,070
Guys keep being... pretend it's all immersion.

1477
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,970
Don't get immersed guys.

1478
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,690
Don't get immersed.

1479
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,530
Okay, we're back.

1480
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,470
We're back.

1481
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,370
Share the cell phone.

1482
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:30,010
You're telling me on a train this well kept...

1483
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,650
That the damage was here before.

1484
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,750
Before we arrived?

1485
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,530
Well, I...

1486
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,150
I believe someone is responsible for hitting that shelf.

1487
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,170
You said nothing was around for the shelf to fall onto.

1488
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:50,330
What was the shell hit with then?

1489
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,230
All right, your fucking hammer.

1490
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:53,970
The stick.

1491
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:56,310
What is that?

1492
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,150
A stick?

1493
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:02,630
You truly believe a stick could do this kind of thing?

1494
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,330
Damage.

1495
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:04,790
Think.

1496
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:06,630
Oh no, come on.

1497
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:09,770
Okay.

1498
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:10,530
Hey.

1499
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,690
No one now, I know what invincible...

1500
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:16,230
Why the fuck would you need invincibility mode on this?

1501
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:19,410
Like... Oh my god what...

1502
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:20,290
Okay, now I know.

1503
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:26,210
Guys I now know why we need invincibility mode.

1504
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:30,610
You're right.

1505
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:34,130
A stick can do this kind... can do this kind of job.

1506
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,350
Sorry!

1507
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:07,270
Oh, the way, but you failed.

1508
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:12,250
The handle to your hammer snapped right off.

1509
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,360
It's as we both said.

1510
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:32,260
I tried to get us out all out with my hammer, but I failed.

1511
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:43,090
I gave the shelf one big whack and I figured it was no big deal.

1512
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:49,550
And I tried to hide it, but I suppose my embarrassment got the better of me.

1513
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:58,310
She does look genuinely sorry about the situation.

1514
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,890
I never expected your hammer to snap like that, Amy.

1515
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:04,110
What is that?

1516
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:05,850
Fucking wish.com?

1517
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,170
It was one of my backups.

1518
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,930
It's a little lighter to carry around.

1519
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:14,470
I didn't think I needed it.

1520
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:21,390
Well, lucky for you, I'm a detective and I dabble as a mechanic.

1521
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,570
The hammer's made of fucking wood, Tails.

1522
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:28,410
Let me see both pieces of the hammer.

1523
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,050
There's no way metal snaps like that.

1524
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,570
No way.

1525
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,630
That was a wood snap.

1526
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,610
Just tighten things here.

1527
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,830
A little elbow grease there.

1528
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,970
And... fixed.

1529
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,290
Tails!

1530
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,610
Thank you!

1531
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,090
He's a carpenter's son.

1532
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:57,910
He is.

1533
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,910
They're all squeaky hammers?

1534
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,450
How the fuck does plastic snap like...

1535
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,330
That still doesn't mean I'm a mechanic!

1536
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:08,250
It's plastic!

1537
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:11,870
Classic way.

1538
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:13,430
Classic wood mechanic.

1539
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:21,970
According to my calculations, if you hit the shelf right here, it could do the trick.

1540
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:25,750
Alright!

1541
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,230
Stand back!

1542
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:34,270
The shelf completely shattered!

1543
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:36,150
Incredible!

1544
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:39,930
That was a fucking squeaky toy.

1545
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,630
Who the fuck said it was?

1546
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:41,910
I said it was a squeaky toy.

1547
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:42,890
I said it was a squeaky toy earlier.

1548
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:45,570
She fucking destroyed the shelf!

1549
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:48,170
No squeaky toy can do that!

1550
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:50,770
We did it!

1551
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:51,930
We're free!

1552
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,150
Property damage.

1553
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,250
Great job, Amy!

1554
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:58,650
Let's get out of here!

1555
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:02,270
It's super expensive.

1556
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,890
It's squeak, but it's metal.

1557
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,610
But it squeaks.

1558
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,110
Wait!

1559
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,530
Is that...

1560
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,550
Is that...

1561
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:12,850
Sonic!

1562
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,630
Oh my god!

1563
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,830
Who could have done such a thing?

1564
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,090
It can't be!

1565
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:27,770
I can't believe Sonic the Hedgehog died in the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog!

1566
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:29,450
Who would have thought?

1567
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,030
It can't be!

1568
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:40,810
Sonic!

1569
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:42,870
He's gone!

1570
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:43,610
No!

1571
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:48,570
Someone murdered my darling Sonic!

1572
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,470
Someone murdered my darling Sonic!

1573
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:53,250
Someone murdered my darling Sonic!

1574
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:55,450
Looks like the game's begun!

1575
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:59,590
I'm finding out who did this once at once!

1576
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,390
I'm finding out who did this once at once!

1577
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,250
Why is she so happy?

1578
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:03,670
Amy, wait!

1579
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,730
I wanna figure out who did this!

1580
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,150
Wait for me!

1581
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:11,110
Wait, what a whirlwind.

1582
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,790
I'm exhausted already.

1583
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,890
That was really convincing, Sonic.

1584
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,330
Yeah, Sonic!

1585
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:18,850
You can stop now!

1586
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:21,910
Sonic?

1587
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,830
Hey, Sonic!

1588
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,090
You can get up!

1589
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:28,870
They're gone now!

1590
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,730
Sonic?

1591
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,000
He's alive!

1592
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:38,720
He's alive!

1593
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,020
He's alive!

1594
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:39,840
He's alive!

1595
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,720
Body...

1596
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,340
Gnome...

1597
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:44,960
Can't...

1598
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,300
Move...

1599
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,980
Oh my god, what if it's Eggman?

1600
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,980
What if it was Eggman all along?

1601
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,740
Like the fucking... secret murderer?

1602
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,760
What are you saying?

1603
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,700
I don't understand!

1604
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,860
I just...

1605
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,500
need to...

1606
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,020
rest...

1607
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:08,300
Sonic?

1608
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,020
Sonic?

1609
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:10,300
SONIC!

1610
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,240
Is he actually hurt?

1611
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:13,980
Huh?

1612
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,120
Man, he can't move.

1613
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,720
Is he actually hurt?

1614
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,400
He's not moving.

1615
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,360
Are those...

1616
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,260
coins on him genuine?

1617
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,160
My hands on his wrist...

1618
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,140
I don't sense a pause!

1619
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,600
My god!

1620
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,480
Where did that voice come from?

1621
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,500
Oh my god!

1622
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:42,640
Oh my god!

1623
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,360
There's no pause!

1624
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,240
Sonic, talk to me!

1625
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,520
Am I...

1626
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,840
Am I doing this right?

1627
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,880
What in the world is going on?

1628
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,820
Is this part of the murder mystery?

1629
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:54,880
Or...

1630
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,360
Is this serious?

1631
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:58,920
Sonic!

1632
01:15:59,380 --> 01:15:59,940
SONIC!

1633
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,240
Oh no...

1634
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,520
I feel myself panicking!

1635
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,460
This is the most accurate way to kill me!

1636
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,540
I've seen depictions of panic attacks in an animated game!

1637
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,000
Calm down!

1638
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,240
Don't give me a PSP tube!

1639
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,120
What do I do?

1640
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,920
Oh, I need you to do...

1641
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,360
everything in your power...

1642
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,900
to make sure...

1643
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:25,300
our paying guests are well taken care of.

1644
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,540
Understood?

1645
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,200
Those guests are incredibly...

1646
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:31,620
renowned.

1647
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:35,320
Which means they must be remarkably rich!

1648
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:36,980
Which means they must be remarkably rich!

1649
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,820
You know...

1650
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,620
MAKA!

1651
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,460
So I leave their care to you...

1652
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,420
Dokimedo FPSB Tube.

1653
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,340
My favorite employee.

1654
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,340
My only employee.

1655
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,800
Surely you won't let me down...

1656
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,020
on this last ride.

1657
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,240
It's my first day!

1658
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,160
I need to catch up to Amy and Tails...

1659
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:09,920
and get to work.

1660
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:10,940
I'm going to the bottom of this...

1661
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,120
even though this is part of the game.

1662
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,920
I just can't risk it.

1663
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,380
I'll keep everyone safe...

1664
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:18,700
conductor.

1665
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:19,440
You'll see.

1666
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,260
I just need to feed Sonic the rings!

1667
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:22,920
I just need to force feed...

1668
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,840
I'm sorry!

1669
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,060
I just need to force feed him the rings!

1670
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,320
Alright, here we go.

1671
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,040
Fudge Top, thank you for the super chat.

1672
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:33,400
Thank you.

1673
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,100
He's definitely not...

1674
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:35,740
Oh my god, we've...

1675
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:36,980
Guys, we made it!

1676
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,040
We finally got through the tutorial!

1677
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,700
It only took one hour!

1678
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,280
We fucking did it!

1679
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,040
Tutorial done.

1680
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,840
Woah, look at this place.

1681
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,140
Tails.

1682
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,160
Tails seems like the most competent one.

1683
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,920
Hey Tails, where were you?

1684
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:05,800
Where are you?

1685
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:09,380
Jokey made of FPSVTube!

1686
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,340
I'm over here!

1687
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,960
I think Amy's already gone on ahead.

1688
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,020
I think Amy's already gone on ahead.

1689
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,140
It seems she's really excited.

1690
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,460
I bet you if there was like...

1691
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,780
It was like the Walking Dead...

1692
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,860
where like, oh, X amount of people chose like...

1693
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:25,200
this route...

1694
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,460
A or B or something...

1695
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,300
I would not be surprised in the maturity...

1696
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,820
of the people, pigtails.

1697
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,780
It seems she's really excited.

1698
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:36,320
It seems she's really excited.

1699
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,960
Did you need something from me?

1700
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,260
Uh, yeah.

1701
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,340
Just a question really.

1702
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,380
How do I put this?

1703
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,440
What if Sonic is actually hurt?

1704
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,300
Just force feed him rings.

1705
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,220
He'll never be hurt.

1706
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,720
He's laughing.

1707
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,500
Sonic doesn't go down so easily.

1708
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,080
He's on a train full of his friends.

1709
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:04,880
He's on a train full of his friends.

1710
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,940
Nothing would actually happen to him.

1711
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,380
Nothing would actually happen to him.

1712
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,720
It's a mystery for Amy.

1713
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:15,120
You have nothing to worry about.

1714
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,600
Promise.

1715
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,240
Plus...

1716
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,660
Sonic likes to nap in a lot of strange spots.

1717
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,400
He's fine.

1718
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,860
It's making a lot of sense.

1719
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,280
But I can't shake what...

1720
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,300
Sonic said to me.

1721
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,200
Is this really part of the murder mystery game?

1722
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,100
Or is there something deeper...

1723
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:36,640
happening?

1724
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:40,320
I need more evidence to figure out what's going on.

1725
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:42,480
Okay.

1726
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:44,860
Okay.

1727
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,160
It's my job.

1728
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:46,740
Okay.

1729
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,120
Wait.

1730
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:47,680
Yeah.

1731
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,280
I'm gonna let him know it's my job so he'll tip me.

1732
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,580
It's my job to keep an eye on you.

1733
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:54,720
It's my job to keep an eye on you.

1734
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,100
The train rules say I gotta stay and watch after everyone.

1735
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,720
The train rules say I gotta stay and watch after everyone.

1736
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,320
You just won't hang out with me.

1737
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,120
You just wanna hang out with me.

1738
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,080
Don't ya?

1739
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:07,600
I can see it in your eyes.

1740
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,960
I mean you picked me over Amy.

1741
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,860
How is everyone great at reading people but me?

1742
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,420
I mean you picked me over Amy.

1743
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,280
As I said...

1744
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,380
The best detectives...

1745
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,720
have sidekicks.

1746
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,160
So I'm happy to have you.

1747
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,340
If you ever catch me looking glum though...

1748
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:26,600
If you ever catch me looking glum though...

1749
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,200
Just know it's because...

1750
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,600
Where's my lawyer card?

1751
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:31,840
Oh my god.

1752
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,140
The last guy to work...

1753
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,820
The last guy to work a case with me...

1754
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:40,340
ditched our practice to join the evil Dr. Iggy.

1755
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:44,220
Not a proper detective without baggage.

1756
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,720
This is true.

1757
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,440
Yeah.

1758
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,240
Oh shit.

1759
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:49,480
Okay.

1760
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,420
Guys, I need you guys to know...

1761
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:53,320
I can't do accents.

1762
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,500
Especially country.

1763
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,340
Okay, wait.

1764
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,800
You vomit.

1765
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,820
What are you doing in my salon?

1766
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:10,360
What are you doing in my salon?

1767
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,700
Sorry.

1768
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,620
I'm not doing country accents.

1769
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,120
I'm not doing country accents.

1770
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,140
What are you doing...

1771
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,860
What are you all doing in my salon?

1772
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,700
What are you all doing in my salon?

1773
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,360
He's trying so hard to stay in character.

1774
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:27,220
He's trying so hard to stay in character.

1775
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,440
Knuckles!

1776
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:31,480
We're trying to figure out who murdered Sonic!

1777
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,380
I can...

1778
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,060
Okay.

1779
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,360
I can see that...

1780
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:39,520
I can see that...

1781
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,220
Amy moseyed through...

1782
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,880
and told me all about it.

1783
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,520
Enough of that.

1784
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,000
Oh, thank god.

1785
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,280
Okay.

1786
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,420
Enough of that.

1787
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,280
I wonder how long he kept that voice up for Amy.

1788
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,220
We were wondering if you could tell us what you were up to...

1789
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:00,900
before the murder.

1790
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,040
Anything to help us establish your alibi.

1791
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,160
And...

1792
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:06,500
Nope.

1793
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,280
I have nothing to tell...

1794
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:08,940
either of you.

1795
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,620
Leave me alone.

1796
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,620
He's sweating!

1797
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,360
He's sweating!

1798
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,020
Analysis!

1799
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,000
He is obviously agitated...

1800
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,780
about something.

1801
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,720
But why take it out on us?

1802
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,880
It's him.

1803
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:27,920
He's the murderer.

1804
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,980
Amy was the red herring.

1805
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,300
He's the actual murderer.

1806
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:34,620
I know better than to argue with Knuckles.

1807
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,700
So it seems we're on our own.

1808
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,040
Dokimedo FPS Vtube.

1809
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:40,360
Dokimedo FPS Vtube.

1810
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,460
We need to figure out what Knuckles...

1811
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,560
was up to while we were all apart.

1812
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,500
Let's investigate for clues...

1813
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,280
and then...

1814
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:51,620
interrogate.

1815
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:53,020
Right!

1816
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:53,980
Let's do it!

1817
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:54,820
Okay.

1818
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,920
He's obviously...

1819
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,160
He played video games and then smashed it.

1820
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,160
Clearly won't be able to give the game...

1821
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,460
Super Monkey Ball a try.

1822
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,580
Do we think it broke when the train...

1823
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,180
sped up?

1824
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,660
The damages...

1825
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,820
look more to be caused from...

1826
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:11,740
punches?

1827
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:14,400
Who could it... Oh, I wonder who?

1828
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,860
Could it be the Echidna?

1829
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,820
That has a name...

1830
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:21,340
Whose name is based on his fucking hands?

1831
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:22,420
No.

1832
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,260
Whose entire fucking super power is punching?

1833
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:28,520
No.

1834
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,200
Nah.

1835
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,280
Probably not.

1836
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:39,440
What are you two looking at me for?

1837
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,320
Smashed Arcade...

1838
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,640
is added to your...

1839
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,480
inventory.

1840
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,400
No fucking...

1841
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:47,900
way.

1842
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,820
No fucking way.

1843
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,340
Alright, let's talk to the head.

1844
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,060
The robotic arms here are really...

1845
01:23:59,060 --> 01:23:59,420
helpful.

1846
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,420
Mmm.

1847
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,240
Mmm.

1848
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:05,100
Hahaha.

1849
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,740
What's the arm doing to my hair?

1850
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,300
He fixed it up a bit!

1851
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,380
That's incredible!

1852
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,160
What interesting...

1853
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,480
tech.

1854
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,880
Uh oh.

1855
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,620
Should I fear for my job a little bit?

1856
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,540
How well can it microwave?

1857
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,560
What's this?

1858
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,320
Decent cash...

1859
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,060
reward for finding this robot.

1860
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,700
Maybe I'll keep an eye out.

1861
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,560
Ooh, I need that.

1862
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:30,660
Poor...

1863
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:31,460
Omochao.

1864
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,360
Hate to see them like this.

1865
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,640
What'd they do?

1866
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:36,900
Medical Mount...

1867
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:37,280
What?

1868
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,340
Interesting.

1869
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,180
Wait, what the fuck did they do?

1870
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,340
What the fuck?

1871
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,780
Alright.

1872
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:45,380
Oh.

1873
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,780
Dokimedo FPS VTube.

1874
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,080
This is...

1875
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:49,620
interesting.

1876
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,280
What is?

1877
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,160
It's just a few...

1878
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,680
used cups.

1879
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:55,220
Sure.

1880
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,920
But why are there...

1881
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,280
three...

1882
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,520
knuckles.

1883
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,800
You know what they say about...

1884
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,360
your kidness.

1885
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,860
Ugh!

1886
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:07,530
Um...

1887
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,520
Knuckles was really...

1888
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,000
thirsty.

1889
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,520
Dokimedo FPS VTube.

1890
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,520
This one has a lipstick...

1891
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,400
on the rim!

1892
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,940
That's not...

1893
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,700
Knuckles' color at all!

1894
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,620
Wait, he wears...

1895
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,120
lipstick?

1896
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,320
Someone else...

1897
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,720
must have been here.

1898
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,340
We should log in.

1899
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:34,120
Rouge!

1900
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,660
Oh, knuckles!

1901
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,360
You sly...

1902
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:39,500
dog!

1903
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,780
I think we have enough clues.

1904
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:43,640
Knuckles!

1905
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,100
What are you...

1906
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,920
doing with Rouge the cat?

1907
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:49,660
Oh, wait, no.

1908
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,500
Wait, Rouge the bat?

1909
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,180
What?

1910
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,080
Bat, cat...

1911
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,760
same thing.

1912
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:59,240
Bats are basically flying cats.

1913
01:25:59,480 --> 01:25:59,720
Okay.

1914
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,380
I thought I told you...

1915
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:05,860
to leave me alone.

1916
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:08,680
I like your hat.

1917
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,340
Oh!

1918
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,200
Guys!

1919
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,300
I'm getting...

1920
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,180
better at Rizzing, people.

1921
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,360
I told...

1922
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,260
you, chat!

1923
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,300
I told you I'm getting better...

1924
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,180
at Rizzing!

1925
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:25,700
Knuckles!

1926
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,380
Are you...

1927
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,160
blushing?

1928
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,940
I said...

1929
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:33,340
I said...

1930
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,140
leave me alone.

1931
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,200
Doesn't look like he's...

1932
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,380
used to being...

1933
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,420
complimented.

1934
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,680
Jonesy, thank you for the super chat.

1935
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,020
Thank you.

1936
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,220
I can't believe Doki murdered...

1937
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:46,780
Sonic for his passport.

1938
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,460
Did you just adjust...

1939
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,240
your hat a bit so...

1940
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,540
we could see it...

1941
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:53,580
better?

1942
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:57,220
I said...

1943
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:57,780
leave!

1944
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,220
Alright, can I take...

1945
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:01,620
your order?

1946
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,580
Hm.

1947
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,340
Not...

1948
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:03,680
hungry.

1949
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,240
Well, yeah...

1950
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:05,780
alright.

1951
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,160
Just let me know, won't ya?

1952
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,400
Don't tell the robot I wanna keep...

1953
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,040
my job.

1954
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,260
Sure.

1955
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,380
Like a butler of sorts.

1956
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:13,840
Right?

1957
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,100
Come on, DokiMatoFPSV2.

1958
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,780
You're not a butler.

1959
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:20,100
Tell him that.

1960
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,840
Yeah, like a butler.

1961
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,600
Cause I'm a little bitch.

1962
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:26,720
Excellent.

1963
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,220
Thank you, butler.

1964
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,000
Dang it!

1965
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,120
Oh shit, wait.

1966
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,060
He doesn't wanna talk to me.

1967
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,180
Alright.

1968
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,340
Start the interrogation.

1969
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:38,300
Objection!

1970
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:39,820
Knuckles.

1971
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,580
DokiMatoFPSV2.

1972
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,060
And I need to determine what you...

1973
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,340
were doing during the hour the murder...

1974
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:47,880
took place.

1975
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,020
I already told you.

1976
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:50,940
Buzz off!

1977
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:53,420
You're not getting anything out of me.

1978
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:55,860
Thank you, butler.

1979
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,060
We don't need to say much.

1980
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:58,980
What happened here is pretty obvious.

1981
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,380
Hm.

1982
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:02,800
Wait.

1983
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,180
It is?

1984
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,900
We have evidence too.

1985
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,600
We do?

1986
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:11,600
DokiMatoFPSV2.

1987
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,040
Just take a good...

1988
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,460
look at our inventory.

1989
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:14,960
Okay.

1990
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:17,340
I hope we're gonna grab more evidence.

1991
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,560
Because having two evidence...

1992
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,820
tells...

1993
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,280
tells the entire story.

1994
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,360
And like, I really just need...

1995
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,280
It's like a 50-50 on the order of the evidence.

1996
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,440
What was distracting Knuckles...

1997
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,240
during the time Sonic was murdered?

1998
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,480
His little...

1999
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:35,880
date.

2000
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:37,280
Yeah.

2001
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:39,720
Wait.

2002
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,200
What?

2003
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,360
Wrong choice.

2004
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,200
DokiMatoFPSV2.

2005
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,160
Let's try again.

2006
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:45,820
Wait.

2007
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,340
I lost the 50-50 guys.

2008
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,480
Just like Doki Day.

2009
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,200
I lost the 50-50.

2010
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:54,020
Okay.

2011
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,100
The smashed arcade.

2012
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,100
The arcade machine?

2013
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,340
Ha!

2014
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,700
What makes you think I touched it?

2015
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:05,440
Think!

2016
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:05,520
Think!

2017
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,040
Oh no.

2018
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:06,420
Okay.

2019
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:07,300
Okay.

2020
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,200
Guys, I'm thinking.

2021
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,320
Guys...

2022
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,020
I'm thinking.

2023
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,540
God, I'm thinking so hard right now.

2024
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:19,020
Oh my god.

2025
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,140
You can see my brain.

2026
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,040
Nice.

2027
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:22,640
I did it.

2028
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,500
As long as I don't send any spikes.

2029
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,380
Oh my god.

2030
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,880
Where's the fucking light bulb?

2031
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:28,920
I did it!

2032
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,420
I think!

2033
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:35,620
This isn't a tough one, Knuckles.

2034
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,260
Knuckles.

2035
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:40,640
You clearly touched the arcade machine because...

2036
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,800
The arcade...

2037
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,340
Okay.

2038
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,320
Your hair was filed at the scene.

2039
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:45,620
Okay.

2040
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:45,820
Wait.

2041
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,500
I wanna see this.

2042
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:47,960
You mean fur?

2043
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,520
Fur?

2044
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,600
You mean spines?

2045
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:52,880
Doesn't matter.

2046
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,700
Cause it seems I'm wrong here.

2047
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,000
Knuckles, you clearly touched the arcade machine because...

2048
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,820
The arcade machine cabinet is covered in punches!

2049
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,220
Take that!

2050
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,620
What evidence do you have?

2051
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:08,020
That the damages are punches!

2052
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:09,840
Hmm...

2053
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,120
Hmm...

2054
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,860
What are y'all staring at my hands for?

2055
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:16,700
My...

2056
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,520
Nipple hands...

2057
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,540
Do you guys know that famous, like...

2058
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,220
Sonic the Hedgehog comic?

2059
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,960
Regarding Knuckles' like...

2060
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:27,680
Nipple hands?

2061
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,240
And then the...

2062
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,920
The creator of that Sonic comic...

2063
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,960
Became like an official...

2064
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,500
Artist for the official Sonic comics?

2065
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:37,760
Did you guys kn...

2066
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:43,720
Did you guys know that?

2067
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,580
A little fun fact for you...

2068
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:46,540
Um...

2069
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:50,020
I don't think the official Sonic channel...

2070
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:50,760
Would like...

2071
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,660
Vouch for me though.

2072
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,600
Knuckles, you clearly destroyed the arcade machine.

2073
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,900
But why?

2074
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,460
I needed a punching bag.

2075
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:06,740
And none were available to me.

2076
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:10,320
Just a sudden urge to punch?

2077
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:11,660
Huh?

2078
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,080
I vouch!

2079
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,360
See?

2080
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,460
What I told you!

2081
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,280
It was real!

2082
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,840
He vouches!

2083
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:20,580
It's real!

2084
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:26,200
I believe repairing the arcade machine...

2085
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,480
Will give us our answer.

2086
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,880
How would you?

2087
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,120
I'm on it!

2088
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:33,900
Tokimato FPS VTube!

2089
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:35,340
Distract Knuckles!

2090
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,300
While I fix Super Monkey Ball!

2091
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,260
Bring it on!

2092
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,160
Oh shit!

2093
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:41,960
Don't worry.

2094
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,280
Let me pull up my fucking...

2095
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,660
Dream gear real quick.

2096
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:47,280
Sorry Knuckles.

2097
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,020
I can't pause the video game.

2098
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,180
This is...

2099
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,380
This is more important...

2100
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,280
Than an actual fight.

2101
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,660
Alright, here we go.

2102
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,140
Nice.

2103
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:00,540
Dodged.

2104
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,620
Easy!

2105
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,300
Oh my god.

2106
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,620
So fucking easy.

2107
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,720
Pink Doki Pink!

2108
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,300
The arcade machine is fixed!

2109
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,100
No!

2110
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:14,680
Don't look at the score!

2111
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,240
Quick!

2112
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:17,440
Look at the scores!

2113
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,320
I'm pulling it up now!

2114
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:23,640
I'm pulling it up now!

2115
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,320
Okay, what does that...

2116
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:25,840
Oh my gosh.

2117
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:26,720
By one point.

2118
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,520
Oh my god.

2119
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,060
Noob.

2120
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,660
Wait, does that...

2121
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,620
Oh okay, it says bread.

2122
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:33,100
Okay.

2123
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:36,000
Okay, what does this tell us?

2124
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,700
Nothing obviously.

2125
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,440
It tells us something massive!

2126
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,280
It tells us something massive!

2127
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,140
Look at the name at the top of the list!

2128
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,300
It's Vector!

2129
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,240
He's supposed to be in the...

2130
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,400
Library...

2131
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,200
He's like, hey do you remember where Vector is?

2132
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,060
Do you remember?

2133
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:53,980
If you don't remember, don't worry.

2134
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:55,580
It's in bolded red letters.

2135
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,620
It's supposed to be in...

2136
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:59,420
The library car!

2137
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:03,040
You just got Vectored.

2138
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:03,560
Oh yeah!

2139
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,880
The picture is beginning to be painted here.

2140
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,020
You competed with Vector to see who could get the highest score.

2141
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,520
And Vector beat you!

2142
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,380
Mmm...

2143
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:22,880
And in frustration, you destroyed the arcade cabinet!

2144
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:25,580
Aaaaaaah.

2145
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,720
He is punching the air in frustration.

2146
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,240
You are guessing.

2147
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:32,780
Where is your proof?

2148
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,780
Where is your evidence?

2149
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,800
Vector is a common name.

2150
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,160
Prove to me he was here.

2151
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,220
NOW!

2152
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,200
Okay, I am thinking.

2153
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:48,460
I don't know, there's like... wait but who's... I guess it was like Rouge, Vector...

2154
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:51,400
Oh my god, they're not playing the game, seriously!

2155
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,280
It's Amy's birthday!

2156
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,380
Why are they not taking care of... oh shit, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

2157
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,960
Why are they not taking her birthday seriously?

2158
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,380
I just barely made it, holy fuck.

2159
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,040
Maybe I should put on journalist mode.

2160
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:19,440
Now, looking made of FPSV tube, what proves Vector was here with Knuckles?

2161
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:25,460
Okay, I mean, I have two evidence, like what would my other evidence be?

2162
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:26,740
It's process of elimination.

2163
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:29,500
No!

2164
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,360
I thought it was strange there was more than one cup sitting next to you.

2165
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,760
Wow, you were supposed to be participating in the murder mystery game for Amy's birthday!

2166
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:46,380
You and Vector enjoyed some drinks playing arcade!

2167
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:54,060
It's... I'm... it's not like... it's not, I wasn't.

2168
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,900
There was a woman there too.

2169
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:59,320
Don't tell Amy.

2170
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,300
I think we're on the right track here.

2171
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:10,200
It's as you say, Vector popped in at the top of the hour.

2172
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:13,640
Wanting to play the arcade machine with me.

2173
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,420
We went back and forth, trying to figure the game out.

2174
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,520
But when we did, we competed for the high score.

2175
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:26,940
When he defeated me, I destroyed the machine.

2176
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:30,020
No proof of his win.

2177
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,280
Jesus Christ, man.

2178
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:39,640
I was trying to fix the arcade cabinet before you two came in.

2179
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,280
Honest.

2180
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,520
I didn't want to be caught.

2181
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,180
And that's my story.

2182
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,700
An alibi.

2183
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:51,940
I've already told an unbridged version of this to Amy.

2184
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:52,660
Wait, then why...

2185
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:56,040
Okay, if he told this version to Amy, why didn't he tell us?

2186
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:57,100
Like, he already got caught.

2187
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,180
Knuckles, you're just fucking stupid.

2188
01:35:59,320 --> 01:35:59,920
You already got caught!

2189
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,940
Why were you like trying to hide it?

2190
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:06,560
Whoa, this friend group...

2191
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,620
Has a lot of pride issues.

2192
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,740
I mean, there's a lot of issues in Sonic the Fandom.

2193
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:16,040
That explains one of the used cups.

2194
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:18,620
But...

2195
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:21,120
What is a cup with a lipstick mark?

2196
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:22,900
Hmm...

2197
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:25,160
I don't want people to know...

2198
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,340
That there was a woman here too.

2199
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,820
Who was in here too.

2200
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:32,720
Nevermind, I'm okay with saying it.

2201
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,640
Hahahaha!

2202
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:38,160
Hahahaha!

2203
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,080
It's inconsequential.

2204
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,320
Not worth mentioning.

2205
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:50,340
So you searched around for something.

2206
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:51,160
But failed.

2207
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,680
Made fun of her again.

2208
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,320
And left.

2209
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,640
I'm nauseous, that one.

2210
01:36:58,740 --> 01:36:59,480
But...

2211
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,400
You offered a drink, apparently?

2212
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,400
Listen...

2213
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,240
I don't know why she showed up.

2214
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,360
And I told you everything that happened before the train sped up.

2215
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,860
Are you not satisfied?

2216
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:11,700
Will you two relent?

2217
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:13,820
Hmm...

2218
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,720
I'm understanding the scenario.

2219
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,000
Vector visited to play games.

2220
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,280
Rouge couldn't find something and left.

2221
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,320
Then Knuckles destroyed the machine.

2222
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,520
That all makes sense to me.

2223
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:27,480
Thank you for answering so many of our quest...

2224
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,160
Actually...

2225
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,360
Actually...

2226
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,000
That's not everything.

2227
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:33,220
Hahaha!

2228
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,720
Is it Knuckles?

2229
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,600
Wait, there's more?

2230
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,720
He's clearly innocent.

2231
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,320
Huh?

2232
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,160
Hmm?

2233
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:44,400
He's sweating!

2234
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,260
Wait, there is more!

2235
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,760
I wanna step back to something I noticed.

2236
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:52,200
One more name on the high score list.

2237
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:54,400
Doesn't make sense.

2238
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:55,520
Wait, what?

2239
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:57,120
I just remembered bread.

2240
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,260
Dokimedo FPS VTube.

2241
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,740
Can you take a look one more time?

2242
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:06,300
An odd name on the high score list.

2243
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,800
What is Tails talking about?

2244
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,140
There's more?

2245
01:38:14,570 --> 01:38:15,170
Ultim?

2246
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,410
Where's Ultim?

2247
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:20,470
Is it Ultim?

2248
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:23,710
Cause like all of this is food.

2249
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:25,330
And then there's Ultim.

2250
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:26,250
Ultimate?

2251
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:28,910
All the names...

2252
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:29,030
Yeah!

2253
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:30,310
All the other names...

2254
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,770
have food theme.

2255
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,210
But this one...

2256
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:38,130
Who here goes by Ultim?

2257
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:39,910
Who the fuck is Ultim?

2258
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:44,870
You may not know Dokimedo FPS VTube.

2259
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,950
But there is someone here...

2260
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,750
that goes by that title.

2261
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:51,810
The ultimate life form.

2262
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:52,570
Oh!

2263
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:58,390
Oh!

2264
01:38:59,590 --> 01:38:59,710
Oh!

2265
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:08,170
Truly...

2266
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:11,650
The most edgy one out there.

2267
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:18,810
There's really someone here.

2268
01:39:19,110 --> 01:39:19,890
I told you.

2269
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:22,650
I'm just trying to be immersive chat.

2270
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:25,170
I'm just trying to be immersive.

2271
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:25,890
Okay?

2272
01:39:27,690 --> 01:39:30,330
I'm role playing as my Sonic OC.

2273
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:33,230
There's really someone here that goes by that?

2274
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:34,470
Also he's fucking...

2275
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,950
Bro!

2276
01:39:35,230 --> 01:39:35,850
You can't...

2277
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:38,890
How are you in the ultimate life form when you suck at video games?

2278
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:42,450
Nothing sneaks by you, does it bud?

2279
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:46,530
Vector and I were struggling so much with the game.

2280
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:47,850
But then...

2281
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:49,830
Shadow dropped by.

2282
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:51,810
So...

2283
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:53,090
Shadow is here too?

2284
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:56,830
We're not taking seriously of Amy's fucking birthday party!

2285
01:39:57,230 --> 01:39:59,610
What are you doing outside of your carts?

2286
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:06,550
He taught us the game and was the first to get his name on the scoreboard.

2287
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:10,250
Vector and I then fought to be Shadow's score.

2288
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:12,870
They're both very annoying.

2289
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:16,730
We only meanly had to compete, huh?

2290
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,230
He gave me this before he left!

2291
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:21,190
What did he give?

2292
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:21,730
A key?

2293
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:23,770
Where did Shadow go to?

2294
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:25,990
What was Shadow's cart?

2295
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:28,890
Shadow told me to lock the door.

2296
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,770
And to not open it for anyone.

2297
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:32,030
Then...

2298
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:32,990
He left.

2299
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,990
When Vector was leaving...

2300
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:37,770
I locked the door behind him.

2301
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:40,390
Saw no one else after locking the door.

2302
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:42,070
That is pretty sus.

2303
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:43,310
He did it!

2304
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,430
Knuckles and Amy were the red heron!

2305
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:46,670
It was Shadow!

2306
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,550
That's the honest truth.

2307
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:57,130
So when Amy came through here not too long ago...

2308
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:58,730
Did you open the door for her?

2309
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,370
It was Shadow!

2310
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,210
I knew it!

2311
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:02,430
I knew it was Shadow!

2312
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:04,110
No...

2313
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:06,670
I think she has some sort of key too.

2314
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:09,870
That's right.

2315
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:12,950
The conductor gave her that special birthday key.

2316
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:16,530
Well...

2317
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:18,870
I have a lot of questions.

2318
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:23,290
What happened in the library that caused Vector to come here?

2319
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:26,690
Why is Shadow locked in doors?

2320
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:28,870
And what was Rouge searching for?

2321
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:31,230
I don't know.

2322
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:33,570
They didn't tell me.

2323
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:37,390
Even though I asked with that cowboy accent.

2324
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:38,930
Y'all...

2325
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:44,570
You're gonna have to find them and ask them yourself.

2326
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:47,970
We did it!

2327
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:51,290
We fucking did it!

2328
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,430
We solved the mystery!

2329
01:41:52,670 --> 01:41:54,430
That is not Shadow...

2330
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:54,650
No sorry.

2331
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:55,310
Not Knuckles.

2332
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,790
Not Knuckles.

2333
01:41:57,270 --> 01:42:00,310
As of right now, I believe your story Knuckles.

2334
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:04,110
We'll only know for sure when we confirm things with Vector.

2335
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:05,930
Fair enough.

2336
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:08,370
The library is in the next car.

2337
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:10,710
I'll open the lock for you.

2338
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:17,110
Give whatever KO'd Sonic an earful for me, Detective Tails and Butler.

2339
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:21,030
I liked it better when he wasn't talking to us.

2340
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:24,090
Will do, Sheriff!

2341
01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:26,930
Come on, Doki-Mato FPS VTube!

2342
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:28,790
Let's head to the library!

2343
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:31,390
But we gotta knock first so they can, you know...

2344
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,910
In case we're interrupting anything.

2345
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:37,250
This is way more exciting than microwaving chili dogs.

2346
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,130
Doki-Mato FPS VTuber!

2347
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:42,050
Coming!

2348
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,490
Alright, let's go.

2349
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:45,710
Knock knock!

2350
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,390
Ready to mosey down on the next car.

2351
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:50,450
Oh wait.

2352
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,770
There's something in the trash can?

2353
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:54,750
Okay, what's in the trash can?

2354
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,770
Something's always hidden in the trash.

2355
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,310
Let's check there.

2356
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,550
Sadly, this one's empty as well.

2357
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:02,750
Liars!

2358
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:07,030
It's only a matter of time, Tails.

2359
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:07,810
Have faith.

2360
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:08,970
You're liars!

2361
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:10,430
There was nothing in the trash can!

2362
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:13,270
It's as they say.

2363
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:17,330
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

2364
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:18,610
Haha!

2365
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,190
I think Tails is ignoring me.

2366
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:22,550
Wait, try.

2367
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:22,890
Trust.

2368
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:24,710
Okay.

2369
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:26,170
It's only...

2370
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:27,150
Alright, we're gonna keep pressing.

2371
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:29,390
It's empty!

2372
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:30,290
What do you mean?

2373
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:34,250
It's still empty!

2374
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:38,070
Wait, is there an extra trash can?

2375
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:38,350
No!

2376
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:41,050
This one's empty!

2377
01:43:41,390 --> 01:43:42,550
Trust the system?

2378
01:43:43,770 --> 01:43:47,150
Okay, how many times do I have to press the fucking trash can?

2379
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:50,350
Oh, they mean the next car.

2380
01:43:50,590 --> 01:43:51,110
Okay.

2381
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:55,010
Alright.

2382
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,750
You got it, partner.

2383
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:00,010
Here we go.

2384
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:03,450
Onwards!

2385
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:09,410
Whoa.

2386
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:10,290
The library.

2387
01:44:10,450 --> 01:44:11,010
Hang in there.

2388
01:44:11,670 --> 01:44:12,950
The library car.

2389
01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:15,630
This is a big ass fucking car.

2390
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:20,190
This does not feel accurate to like the saloon back then.

2391
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:21,690
This is wider than the saloon.

2392
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:25,110
Oh, this stuff's getting heavy.

2393
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,870
I'll dump what I don't need.

2394
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:30,570
Everyone's favorite journalist reporter.

2395
01:44:31,690 --> 01:44:34,950
Amy Rose is hot on the scoop.

2396
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:37,530
I'm heading out.

2397
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:40,870
You've been fabulously helpful.

2398
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:43,230
Already?

2399
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:48,870
Before you go, Espio and I wanted to give you your presents.

2400
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:51,030
My presents?

2401
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:53,890
You're both too sweet.

2402
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,770
Thank you.

2403
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:58,070
Victor.

2404
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,590
It seems we have more guests.

2405
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:02,730
We have company.

2406
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:05,850
Amy!

2407
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:07,070
There you are.

2408
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:10,850
Are you found any leads yet?

2409
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:11,910
No, she doesn't have to join us.

2410
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:16,170
It's okay.

2411
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,130
She doesn't have to join us.

2412
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:18,850
We don't want too many customers.

2413
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:19,570
Cook's in the kitchen.

2414
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:21,190
Oh?

2415
01:45:21,610 --> 01:45:24,690
The detective pair needs help from the birthday.

2416
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:27,310
This is exactly why you're not joining us, Amy.

2417
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,670
This is...

2418
01:45:32,590 --> 01:45:36,450
She knows everyone's allowed to be this sassy on their birthday.

2419
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:41,610
This tip is just too juicy to ignore.

2420
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:43,190
I'll see you all around.

2421
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:46,290
Don't worry, Sonic.

2422
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:49,410
I'll be the one to avenge you and quick.

2423
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:53,050
But how are you going to leave?

2424
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:55,430
The door to the next car is locked.

2425
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:58,830
You doubt the birthday girl?

2426
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:02,990
I have the journalist mode key.

2427
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:06,850
Right, right.

2428
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:09,890
The birthday girl gets journalist mode.

2429
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:11,970
Of course.

2430
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:14,030
It's a birthday privilege.

2431
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:21,350
I'll solve the case before anyone else.

2432
01:46:21,870 --> 01:46:22,470
Bye!

2433
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:29,160
Amy may be hasty, but she's thorough.

2434
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:32,980
Now, what are you two doing here?

2435
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:36,120
Looking mighty suspicious, I say.

2436
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:42,000
Wait, does that mean like the key that Knuckles has only works for like one car?

2437
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,280
So like...

2438
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,680
Oh, because it's not the master key.

2439
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,340
It's like in the...

2440
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,180
Wait, then how did Shadow get the fucking...

2441
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:48,820
I fucking knew it was Shadow.

2442
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,780
How the fuck did Shadow grab the saloon car key?

2443
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,440
I'm the detective.

2444
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,960
And so I can be the murderer.

2445
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:02,780
I knew it was Tails.

2446
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:03,340
I knew it.

2447
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:07,040
Knuckles, uh, Vector, uh...

2448
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:10,120
Knuckles, Shadow, and Amy were red herons.

2449
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:10,740
I knew it.

2450
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,660
It was Tails all along.

2451
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:14,620
And I'm...

2452
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:15,500
Uh...

2453
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,780
Oh, he's the lock spy!

2454
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:18,620
I forgot he's the lock spy.

2455
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:19,140
I forgot he's the lock smith.

2456
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:22,300
Oh yeah, he had a job.

2457
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:22,880
Sorry.

2458
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:25,560
The ultimate life form actually has a...

2459
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,000
Imagine being the ultimate life form and still having a job...

2460
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,160
Having to get a job.

2461
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,200
Um, I'm here to ask if anybody's hungry.

2462
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:35,560
Starved!

2463
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,260
I'll kill you for a chicken parmesan right about now.

2464
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:43,100
Maybe kill isn't the right language to use right now.

2465
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:44,400
Sonic's dead.

2466
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,460
Um, Vector the butcher.

2467
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,860
I'm licensed to handle raw meat.

2468
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:51,980
Huh.

2469
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:53,580
That's right.

2470
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,960
And I'm Espio the poet.

2471
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:05,560
Ah, poetry.

2472
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,540
A resident message from poet to reader.

2473
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:15,800
Meant to challenge our delicate perspective with the most...

2474
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,660
Rhythmic of poise.

2475
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:19,700
Fucking...

2476
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:21,260
NERD!

2477
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:24,860
Can I hear some?

2478
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:27,380
Sure.

2479
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:31,120
Oh my god, he's a poser!

2480
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:33,460
Teardrops in the spring.

2481
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,660
Can you hear me sing?

2482
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:39,460
La la la la dee dee dee dee.

2483
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,560
Oh my god, that was so beautiful.

2484
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,560
That was so beautiful, guys.

2485
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:46,860
Oh my god.

2486
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,440
Beautiful.

2487
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,860
Was that it?

2488
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,040
I have more if you like.

2489
01:48:55,540 --> 01:48:58,120
Cherry blossoms in the spring.

2490
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:02,040
I'm satisfied now, thanks.

2491
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:03,980
I can't believe it.

2492
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,160
Why did you interrupt him?

2493
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:06,560
It was going so well.

2494
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,760
I'm blue da ba dee ba da da.

2495
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,820
At least he's rhyming, I suppose.

2496
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:14,440
I cry every time.

2497
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:17,060
It was like a haiku, but like with more syllables.

2498
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:21,980
It was almost like a haiku, guys.

2499
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:27,320
It was just like, you know, it might be just like a little bit more syllables than it should be.

2500
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,820
But it was almost like a haiku.

2501
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:31,480
Tokimedo, FPSVTube.

2502
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:35,960
And I am here to establish both of your alibis.

2503
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:38,080
It's snowing on Mt.

2504
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:38,740
Fuji.

2505
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:43,900
Can you walk us through what happened after Amy...

2506
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,160
had everyone leave the dining car?

2507
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,100
Oh sure, it's simple.

2508
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,640
We just explain to Amy, actually.

2509
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:52,380
Alright.

2510
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:55,780
Okay, so after this, we gotta talk through this.

2511
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,280
And then we gotta talk to Shadow.

2512
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,720
And then we solve the mystery.

2513
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:03,660
When we're all sent off, it's always like it has to be like the last person.

2514
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:04,980
And I knew it was Shadow.

2515
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,580
Everybody else were red herrings.

2516
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:10,400
Shadow and Sonic all pass through this library car.

2517
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,840
Where Amy told me...

2518
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,740
and Espio to stay.

2519
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,420
I promptly picked up a book off the shelf...

2520
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:21,680
and made myself comfortable.

2521
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,340
Vector got bored.

2522
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:28,380
So he left to see what Knuckles was up to in the saloon car.

2523
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:29,860
Yup.

2524
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:31,940
Where was Rouge?

2525
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,960
We happened to see her...

2526
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:38,300
We happened to see her lipstick stain on a cup after saloon car.

2527
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,140
Rouge came over to the library car.

2528
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:43,400
Seemingly to look for something.

2529
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:44,140
Maybe money?

2530
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,000
I mean she's always looking for money, right?

2531
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:49,440
Then she went to search the saloon car.

2532
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:52,040
She came back shortly after.

2533
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,080
We heard her shout, No way!

2534
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,340
At the brochure stand over there.

2535
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,380
But she left back to the casino car before Shadow came through and locked the door.

2536
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,640
It has to be like some sort of money thing.

2537
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:07,880
Like that's the only thing that gets like Rouge going.

2538
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:09,420
It's always like money related.

2539
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:10,940
Um...

2540
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,960
After all, she's a thief.

2541
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,640
Unlike me, who's also a thief.

2542
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,460
Wonder what she found.

2543
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:22,180
She's obviously been on the hunt for... something.

2544
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:26,960
After Rouge left, Shadow walked through the casino car.

2545
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,380
Then entered the library car and locked the door behind him.

2546
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,060
More importantly...

2547
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:37,180
Why has Shadow been lock...

2548
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:37,300
Yeah!

2549
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,720
Why have you been locking doors?

2550
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,800
What is he trying to hide?

2551
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:41,460
Huh?

2552
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:48,700
Shadow walked through the library car to the saloon car where Knuckles and I were playing games.

2553
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:53,400
He insisted on showing us at Super Monkey Ball.

2554
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:59,420
I got so engrossed by the rolling monkey action, I hardly noticed when Shadow left the saloon car.

2555
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:06,040
I guess he walked through the library car to the casino car again locking the door behind him.

2556
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:11,280
Then returned to the lounge car where he was meant to be stationed.

2557
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:18,100
When Vector came back, we realized Knuckles locked the door to the saloon car.

2558
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,180
We were stuck in the library car.

2559
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:22,860
Yes, because you're supposed to be stationed at your cars.

2560
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:23,900
You're not...

2561
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:25,680
Are you not taking this game seriously?

2562
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,780
Shadow took the game seriously.

2563
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:29,840
It's Amy's birthday.

2564
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:34,360
That's when the train sped up.

2565
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:38,300
We were worried about the bookshelves falling on us.

2566
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,260
But we got through it all right.

2567
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:45,260
We sat trapped here until Amy arrived, asking questions.

2568
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:48,440
She's the one that told us someone murdered Sonic.

2569
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,320
And yeah, that's all that happened.

2570
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,340
I mean, they don't look like they're hiding anything.

2571
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:56,340
Hmm...

2572
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,800
With all these locked doors...

2573
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:04,160
It seems Vector and Espio couldn't have left the library car.

2574
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:06,640
Or the saloon car.

2575
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,400
Thank you both for your cooperation.

2576
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:13,280
We're just gonna peek around and we'll return with any questions.

2577
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:16,040
If you return with any...

2578
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:17,240
Me...

2579
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,700
I'll chop it up for ya.

2580
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,540
And if you like to be serenaded with a poem...

2581
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,540
I've got you covered.

2582
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:28,840
Thanks guys.

2583
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:31,980
Their alibi seems solid enough.

2584
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,580
But we should still search for clues.

2585
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:38,280
What we're looking for is evidence that proves what they're saying.

2586
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,020
It's true!

2587
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:44,360
We need to confirm Vector's reason for leaving his post.

2588
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:47,600
And determine if Espio was actually in the library car.

2589
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:48,760
Reading.

2590
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:50,860
A tall task.

2591
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:52,420
But we can do it.

2592
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,920
Let's get to the bottom of this, Tails.

2593
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:56,340
Absolutely!

2594
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:57,400
Yay!

2595
01:53:58,740 --> 01:54:01,420
Okay, what were the brochures?

2596
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,680
I mean, there's books everywhere.

2597
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,640
So obviously they've been reading, right?

2598
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:07,200
Oh yeah, where's the trash can?

2599
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,380
Something's always hidden in the trash can.

2600
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:10,520
Let's check it there.

2601
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,920
I hate to say it, but there's nothing here.

2602
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,600
I really thought there'd be something there.

2603
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,260
No quimedo, FPSVTube.

2604
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:21,420
Are you sad there was nothing in the trash can?

2605
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:22,920
No.

2606
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,160
I got one guide.

2607
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:37,000
I'm sure there'll be something hidden in the next trash can.

2608
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,740
Wait.

2609
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,040
It's in the next one, I swear.

2610
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:42,580
I won't get one guide again.

2611
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,300
You really think so?

2612
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:47,760
Yeah.

2613
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:48,860
We just gotta stay optimistic.

2614
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:50,760
Yeah.

2615
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:51,600
Okay.

2616
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:53,520
There's no way we get one guide again.

2617
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:54,120
Right, Tails?

2618
01:54:56,020 --> 01:54:57,000
Trust the stream.

2619
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:59,480
Doki made a FPSVTube.

2620
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,960
You're pretty unconventional.

2621
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,240
But I like that.

2622
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:04,900
Was that supposed to be a compliment?

2623
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:06,400
All right.

2624
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:06,620
Anyway...

2625
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:09,540
Assume like... what were she looking at the brochures?

2626
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:11,360
Brochures!

2627
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:13,980
There are travel destination ideas here.

2628
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:17,280
Like amusement parks, caverns, hotels, restaurants!

2629
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:17,940
Oh!

2630
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:21,900
Tokimeto FPS VTube!

2631
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:22,860
Look at this!

2632
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,180
There's a couple maps here.

2633
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:25,300
Wait, of what?

2634
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:26,800
This is like literally...

2635
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,740
It's like... it's a singular line.

2636
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,080
You go up or down.

2637
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,320
This seems to be a map of the library car.

2638
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,580
The books are organized by genres.

2639
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:39,720
What's your list here?

2640
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:43,340
I love a good overhead map.

2641
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:44,640
Let's take it!

2642
01:55:45,320 --> 01:55:45,880
Okay.

2643
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:48,740
Should we take this brochure about cave too?

2644
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:49,580
Look!

2645
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,620
There's stalactites.

2646
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:53,560
Nah!

2647
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:54,260
Leave it!

2648
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,220
Yeah, that's fair.

2649
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,860
Wait, but what was the brochure that Rouge was looking at?

2650
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:03,060
Nobody shares my brochure.

2651
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:04,500
My fondness for caves.

2652
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:05,860
Are they caves?

2653
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:08,100
I mean, that makes sense actually.

2654
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:09,760
Well, this is like...

2655
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,560
scarily accurate.

2656
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,000
To my Sonic OC.

2657
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,340
I wish we had time to pick them up.

2658
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:20,500
I sadly have no interest in picking up these books.

2659
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:25,220
A lot of these were knocked out by the trains speeding up.

2660
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:30,580
But Rouge pulled a lot of these out searching for something.

2661
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:32,200
What's she searching for?

2662
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:33,180
What?

2663
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:34,100
Reckless behavior!

2664
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:36,380
I feel sorry for the poor books.

2665
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:38,920
The spines are creasing.

2666
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:40,160
They're opening too far.

2667
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:43,580
This kid feels empathy for everything.

2668
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:45,120
Wait.

2669
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,220
What could it be?

2670
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:50,320
That could like, disprove what they're saying.

2671
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,220
Like, do I look at the books?

2672
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:54,420
Wow.

2673
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:57,700
I wish I could stop and look at all these books.

2674
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,080
But Sonic needs me.

2675
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:01,720
No time to rest.

2676
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,760
Alright, let's move on then.

2677
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,360
I mean, a little peek wouldn't hurt.

2678
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,960
He's scavenging through all the books a little excitedly.

2679
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,720
He's like a kid in a candy shop.

2680
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,980
Or in this case, a genius in a train library.

2681
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:18,980
That's odd.

2682
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:24,060
I know some books have fallen out on the floor and everything.

2683
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:25,800
But...

2684
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:28,340
Every book on these shelves...

2685
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:30,800
is in alphabetical order.

2686
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:34,200
But this one...

2687
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:34,640
Ohhhh.

2688
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:37,820
How the fuck did you notice that?

2689
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,900
Who looks at the alphabetical...

2690
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:40,520
Oh my god.

2691
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:41,540
What a fucking nerd.

2692
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:42,660
This is...

2693
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:46,900
This is why you're not hanging out with other kids, Tails.

2694
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,560
This is why you're hanging out with adults.

2695
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,540
It's the user guide to the Mirage Express.

2696
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:01,020
The train we're currently on.

2697
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,280
Do you think someone found it on the ground and put it back?

2698
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,440
It is interesting.

2699
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:11,980
Okay, that's mean.

2700
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,440
Where are your children friends?

2701
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:17,440
Where are your friends at your age, Tails?

2702
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:21,160
Let's make a note of this.

2703
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:28,300
Mirage Express manual is added to your inventory.

2704
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:31,460
Alright.

2705
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:31,700
Alright.

2706
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:32,360
We got the...

2707
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:32,820
Oh, wait.

2708
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,280
What?

2709
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,880
Why is there another book?

2710
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,660
What's this bright red book?

2711
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,540
Oh, yuck.

2712
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,240
This reeks of the evil sign.

2713
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,020
Wait, what?

2714
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,160
Dr. Eggman?

2715
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:45,940
What is this written by Dr. Eggman?

2716
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:46,780
I mean, he is a doctor.

2717
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:48,180
Is he a real doctor?

2718
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,680
I remember someone said that he's not a real doctor.

2719
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:51,620
And his name...

2720
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,140
He's like impersonating.

2721
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,200
Yep.

2722
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:59,240
This is Dr. Eggman's autobiography and recipe book.

2723
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:02,280
He is?

2724
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:03,960
He's a real doctor?

2725
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,460
He has a PhD?

2726
01:59:07,260 --> 01:59:08,600
What kind of recipes?

2727
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:11,680
Who cares?

2728
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:13,440
I wouldn't trust any book.

2729
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:15,480
He has a PhD, Tails.

2730
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:16,320
What do you have?

2731
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:17,520
You're not Dr. Tails?

2732
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,700
It's weird this is even here.

2733
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:23,260
Do you even have a master's degree?

2734
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:26,080
Do you have a license to be performing mechanical things?

2735
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:27,540
Did you even went to trade school?

2736
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:31,020
Maybe people just appreciate an omelet.

2737
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,380
You may not be wrong.

2738
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:36,480
Okay.

2739
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:38,360
Oh, the seat?

2740
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:38,660
No.

2741
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,000
What would...

2742
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:42,040
I don't feel like...

2743
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,220
Is there anything else?

2744
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:45,220
Okay.

2745
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,080
What other fucking...

2746
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:52,660
Oh, wait.

2747
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:53,880
Maybe the lights?

2748
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:54,820
Oh, okay.

2749
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,260
Never mind.

2750
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:56,980
Check out our book club.

2751
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:58,060
On the train?

2752
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,140
Book of the month.

2753
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:01,000
Gone gal.

2754
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:02,880
That's nice.

2755
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:07,140
What?

2756
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,860
What can I...

2757
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:09,660
Oh, wait.

2758
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:10,640
Do I have...

2759
02:00:11,420 --> 02:00:12,760
Do I have all the evidence?

2760
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:14,120
Okay.

2761
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:14,760
Let's see.

2762
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:17,140
This is that.

2763
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,980
And then...

2764
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:22,100
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

2765
02:00:22,940 --> 02:00:23,580
Huh.

2766
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:28,520
I don't have all the evidence yet.

2767
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:31,680
The cherry tree?

2768
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:32,600
So, these are pretty obvious.

2769
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:37,720
Let's take a look at that.

2770
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:41,420
That just looks pretty cool.

2771
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:41,420
No,

2772
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,920
I want...

2773
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:47,840
Oh my God!

2774
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:48,840
Oh, tsk.

2775
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:51,920
Oh, it's supposed to be...

2776
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:52,480
WOOOAAHHH!

2777
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:55,060
Ooh, that was tough.

2778
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:56,860
Overall, I really like it.

2779
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:57,240
It's just...

2780
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,080
It's low like in injangando.

2781
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:00,660
I'm in the first row.

2782
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:01,100
I'm a murderer.

2783
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:02,640
Ruined my nap time.

2784
02:01:03,620 --> 02:01:04,920
That is a bit concerning.

2785
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:10,120
Oh, poor thing.

2786
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,840
That arm is really struggling cleaning up this car.

2787
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:16,000
To be fair, I wouldn't want to clean up all this mess either.

2788
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,620
Let's just leave it alone and do its thing.

2789
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:21,540
Yeah, probably for the best.

2790
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:22,800
What?

2791
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:27,800
I feel like I looked at all the evidence except for hang in there, but I'm pretty sure that's not evidence.

2792
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:31,300
A globe of our marvelous planet!

2793
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,140
I haven't traveled around much.

2794
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:38,680
The islands are fun and all, but I love to visit some of the counties.

2795
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,200
They're a lot of fun, honestly.

2796
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,180
Plenty of the wonderful people and shops.

2797
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:46,600
The food can't be beat either.

2798
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,760
Sounds perfect for a vacation.

2799
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:52,800
The conductor was talking about Spagonia.

2800
02:01:53,370 --> 02:01:54,420
Have you ever been there?

2801
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:57,000
I have actually!

2802
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:02,140
If you're ever visiting, be sure to stop at the university and say hi to Professor Picker!

2803
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:07,240
That'll tell you everything about the area and make one scrumptious sandwich!

2804
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,420
I'll keep that in mind.

2805
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:10,180
Thanks!

2806
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,920
This group knows everyone and has been everywhere, haven't they?

2807
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:14,760
Yeah, they're fucking rich!

2808
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,120
DokiMatoFPSVTube, you're just a train boy.

2809
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:21,300
You barely earn minimum wage.

2810
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:23,560
Alright, let's see.

2811
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,180
I feel like I talked to everything except for this.

2812
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,380
I swear to God, this cannot be.

2813
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:29,880
Let me talk to Vector.

2814
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:32,620
Do you bring me any meat to chop?

2815
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,780
I may be a butcher.

2816
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,780
But they confiscated my meat cleaver before getting on the train.

2817
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,160
Did you actually try to bring a knife on the train?

2818
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,200
I mean, I did.

2819
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:48,640
Stop, stop.

2820
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:52,820
I'm a man of authenticity.

2821
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:56,480
Because with a knife, I'm just a chef.

2822
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,340
And a catcher.

2823
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:58,500
I'm a chef's stained apron.

2824
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,080
Not a butcher.

2825
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,660
I think they had a knife on you.

2826
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:04,080
We definitely think you're the murderer.

2827
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:05,720
Um...

2828
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:12,520
Um...

2829
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:14,740
Except for me.

2830
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:17,320
Um...

2831
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:20,680
But what if I hit the knife?

2832
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,280
Hehehehe.

2833
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,320
Hehehehe.

2834
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,320
You know, I'm not the biggest fan of that line of thought.

2835
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:30,640
Alright, can I start my interrogation now?

2836
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,700
I don't think we have enough evidence yet.

2837
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,980
Why don't we take a look... a little more... look around.

2838
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:38,340
Wait, then what the fuck?

2839
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,600
What the fuck am I missing?

2840
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:42,240
I looked at these books.

2841
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,700
I looked at that book.

2842
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:47,240
I looked at the table.

2843
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:50,480
I looked at those books.

2844
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,260
Is there more books that I forgot?

2845
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:56,380
The door?

2846
02:03:58,860 --> 02:03:59,300
Hmm...

2847
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:02,440
Shadow supposedly walked through the library door before going to the saloon car.

2848
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,900
Oh my god, I was supposed to look at the door?

2849
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:12,040
When Shadow left the library car, he locked this door on his way out.

2850
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:14,880
There's gotta be a reason he's doing this.

2851
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,620
Should we make a note of it?

2852
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:20,880
Hmm... I do believe we should.

2853
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:24,420
Shadow's lock is added to your inventory.

2854
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,680
I think we found enough clues.

2855
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:27,300
It was the first time we found a lock.

2856
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:27,620
We're going to have to find a door.

2857
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:30,200
Let's go interrogate Vector.

2858
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,180
I have no idea.

2859
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:32,060
I don't know.

2860
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,780
I don't know what the reasoning is.

2861
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,460
Guys, I don't even know.

2862
02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:37,940
I'm going to have to have the game to handhold me.

2863
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:41,000
I don't know what we figured out.

2864
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:45,620
All right, start interrogation.

2865
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:50,700
So the two of us, you don't believe us?

2866
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:54,080
It's not that I don't trust either of you.

2867
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:54,920
But...

2868
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,180
I wouldn't be a proper detective.

2869
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:21,500
Oh, that's easy.

2870
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:21,920
I got bored.

2871
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:22,640
Hahaha!

2872
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:23,000
Hahaha!

2873
02:05:25,180 --> 02:05:26,080
That's the thing!

2874
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:28,280
Why would you put the butcher in the library?

2875
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:30,260
It doesn't make sense, Amy!

2876
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:31,700
Amy!

2877
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:33,660
This is not immersive!

2878
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,760
Why is he in the library?

2879
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:38,620
Unless he's getting some meat.

2880
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,240
Hahaha!

2881
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:42,440
What?

2882
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:46,240
I wasn't interested... Oh, damn.

2883
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:47,180
Damn.

2884
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,460
That sucks, man.

2885
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:50,640
Hahaha!

2886
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:54,260
I was entertaining him enough, it seems.

2887
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:56,880
Vector enjoys being social.

2888
02:05:57,180 --> 02:05:57,520
Damn.

2889
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:00,320
Just no chemistry, huh?

2890
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,580
Just no chemistry.

2891
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:02,600
Hahaha!

2892
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:10,480
Plus, we were instructed to mingle.

2893
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:14,600
I remembered the arcade machine in the saloon car.

2894
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,760
So I figured I'd go check it out.

2895
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:21,560
This seems to line up with the information we gathered with Knuckles.

2896
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:24,840
That brings our attention to you, SBO.

2897
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:30,360
Woosh entered the library car, found something, and then left.

2898
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:34,100
You said you immediately started reading.

2899
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:38,720
But were you actually reading the entire time you were in the library car?

2900
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,120
Hmm... Of course he was!

2901
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:44,720
Huh?

2902
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:49,940
Once SBO starts reading, he doesn't stop till it's done!

2903
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:51,480
I've seen it happen!

2904
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:52,780
Damn.

2905
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:54,760
Simp.

2906
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,720
It must have been a good read.

2907
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:58,800
What was the book?

2908
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:01,620
Hmm...

2909
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:06,260
SBO doesn't owe you that, detective.

2910
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:07,780
Where's the warrant?

2911
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:08,300
Huh?

2912
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:09,820
Hahaha!

2913
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:11,720
I won't talk until my lawyer's here!

2914
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,560
Let the man live!

2915
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:16,920
What if it was...

2916
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:18,180
Embarrassing!

2917
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,500
What kind of things do you think I read?

2918
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:26,120
If you won't talk, I have a hunch on what that book might be.

2919
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,480
Hmm...

2920
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:30,220
TokimedoFPSBTube, can you help me out?

2921
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:30,960
Let's see.

2922
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:33,080
I wonder if I have any evidence that's just a book.

2923
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:34,260
Hahaha!

2924
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:38,460
Guys, what book do you think SBO may have been reading?

2925
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:39,460
Hahaha!

2926
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:42,960
Hmm...

2927
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,100
I must have...

2928
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,380
I wonder...

2929
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:49,300
I wonder which one is a book.

2930
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:50,060
Hahaha!

2931
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:54,020
Hmm...

2932
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:54,880
Hahaha!

2933
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:59,360
A manual?

2934
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:02,520
You think SBO was reading instructions?

2935
02:08:03,600 --> 02:08:08,220
What argument could you possibly have to support this?

2936
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:10,280
Think, Omno.

2937
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:12,420
It's time to parkour.

2938
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:13,860
Oh no.

2939
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:15,320
There you go.

2940
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:17,200
I like how it's like Sonic.

2941
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:18,560
As like the...

2942
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,440
Oh no, no.

2943
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,100
Why did I jump?

2944
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:20,940
Why did I jump?

2945
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:22,820
Wait, what?

2946
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:23,600
No!

2947
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:24,400
I got confused!

2948
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:29,020
I was like, that was a new mechanic that was introduced and I wasn't sure what was going on!

2949
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:29,440
Okay.

2950
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,060
Alright.

2951
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,000
I figured it out.

2952
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:32,340
I got confused.

2953
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:34,460
They gave me a new mechanic.

2954
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:36,320
And I wasn't prepared.

2955
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:39,780
I didn't have time to actually register what it was.

2956
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:40,720
But it's okay.

2957
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:41,320
I'm a gamer.

2958
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,500
I like how like my name is up there too.

2959
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:44,980
Hahaha!

2960
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,940
There are books scattered around the floor, sure.

2961
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:54,880
But the remaining books on the shelves were all in alphabetical order.

2962
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:58,440
All except this manual.

2963
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:05,920
At least someone, at the very least, picked up the manual up and put it back in the incorrect place.

2964
02:09:06,380 --> 02:09:07,800
Dum-bum-bum!

2965
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:11,780
Hmm...

2966
02:09:11,780 --> 02:09:16,460
This lack of attention to detail isn't normally like you, SPO!

2967
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:18,440
Hey now!

2968
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:21,740
I won't have you insulting my pal like this!

2969
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:25,260
Calm down, Vector.

2970
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,020
I know you, Miwa.

2971
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:29,520
But I can handle myself.

2972
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:32,640
Apologies, SPO.

2973
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:36,280
A butcher and a poet.

2974
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:38,700
Friendship can form anywhere.

2975
02:09:39,720 --> 02:09:42,340
That is indeed the book I was reading.

2976
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:45,860
The Mirage Express Manual.

2977
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:48,540
Trains are... okay.

2978
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,420
Trains are cool.

2979
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:52,600
I like trains.

2980
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:59,260
In that case, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the manual.

2981
02:09:59,900 --> 02:10:02,320
Tokimedo FPSVTube, if you don't mind.

2982
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,380
That's me!

2983
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:06,280
That's me!

2984
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:08,680
Can you ask SPO questions?

2985
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:10,060
I'll ask you some questions about the manual.

2986
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:12,340
Just flip to a page and ask away.

2987
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:14,100
Oh, I see.

2988
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:16,800
Quiz SPO about the manual to prove he read it.

2989
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:18,840
Which page should I quiz him on?

2990
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:19,860
I don't fucking know.

2991
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:21,360
362?

2992
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:23,060
Um...

2993
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:28,420
What efficient and extremely accurate technology was installed to assist and keep...

2994
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:29,000
What is he like?

2995
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:30,080
Does he like fucking...

2996
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,640
Has like that type...

2997
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,120
What is that, memory?

2998
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,440
Photographing memory?

2999
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:34,360
Like, what the fuck?

3000
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,900
Keeping those trains spotless?

3001
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:39,180
Oh my god!

3002
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:40,860
Okay, this is like a random story.

3003
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:43,900
But this reminds me of the time where like...

3004
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:45,040
Um...

3005
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:46,080
I...

3006
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:47,700
I think it was like in middle school.

3007
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:50,920
I was like chosen to do like some fucking like...

3008
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:51,920
Uh...

3009
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:52,940
Some like...

3010
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:53,620
Uh...

3011
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:55,180
Academic tournament or something.

3012
02:10:55,480 --> 02:11:03,020
Where it was like separated by different subjects like psychology, math, reading, English and stuff like that.

3013
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:04,220
And then like...

3014
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,400
And like special subject.

3015
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,520
And then I was selected to be on that team.

3016
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:08,940
And it was like this like academic quiz.

3017
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:10,220
So like you have to have like...

3018
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:10,440
Like...

3019
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:10,880
Like...

3020
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:14,700
Multiple choice questions to answer, debate and uh...

3021
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:16,620
Do not say nerd!

3022
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:17,660
Do not say nerd!

3023
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:25,340
Writing an essay and you compete against like different type...

3024
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:25,900
Different schools.

3025
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:27,120
And then like...

3026
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:28,420
I was studying for it.

3027
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:29,700
And then um...

3028
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:30,180
You know...

3029
02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:34,260
I was studying for it in like the bus ride to like uh...

3030
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:34,940
The venue.

3031
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:36,600
Like cause like I was like...

3032
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:36,920
You know...

3033
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,160
Getting some last minute study on.

3034
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:40,280
And this kid like sat in the...

3035
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,240
Okay I was also a kid.

3036
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:43,140
But this kid like sat next to me.

3037
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:44,280
And then he was like...

3038
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:45,220
Oh you're doing...

3039
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:46,280
You're like um...

3040
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:46,860
Uh...

3041
02:11:46,860 --> 02:11:47,380
Brushing up?

3042
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,020
And I was like...

3043
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:48,680
Yeah I am.

3044
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:49,900
And then he was like...

3045
02:11:49,900 --> 02:11:50,920
Give me a page.

3046
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:51,940
And I was like...

3047
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:52,160
What?

3048
02:11:57,570 --> 02:11:58,750
It was like...

3049
02:11:58,750 --> 02:12:00,170
Give me a page.

3050
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:01,150
And I was like...

3051
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:01,630
I was like...

3052
02:12:01,630 --> 02:12:02,450
Uh...

3053
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:03,310
And I was like...

3054
02:12:03,310 --> 02:12:04,250
This page.

3055
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:05,610
And then he read...

3056
02:12:05,610 --> 02:12:08,790
Word to word what it was on that page.

3057
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:10,590
And then that was the day.

3058
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:12,350
I realized I'm not special.

3059
02:12:19,290 --> 02:12:22,130
I was not special.

3060
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:29,870
Not nerd enough.

3061
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:33,010
There is always someone stronger.

3062
02:12:35,150 --> 02:12:36,210
Okay.

3063
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:39,850
What efficient and extremely accurate technology...

3064
02:12:39,850 --> 02:12:44,530
Was installed to assist in keeping the train spotless.

3065
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:47,170
Um...

3066
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:48,190
Robot...

3067
02:12:48,190 --> 02:12:48,430
Okay.

3068
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:49,190
And then like...

3069
02:12:49,190 --> 02:12:51,270
I tested him in various other pages.

3070
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:51,930
And...

3071
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:52,550
Yeah.

3072
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:55,350
Needless to say...

3073
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:57,230
I'm pretty sure that kid did really well.

3074
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:02,550
Robotic arms.

3075
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:03,930
During events...

3076
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:06,010
They can perform a variety of tasks.

3077
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:08,730
And are responsible for cleaning up the trash.

3078
02:13:09,070 --> 02:13:09,710
And...

3079
02:13:09,710 --> 02:13:09,830
And...

3080
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:11,230
Messes afterwards.

3081
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:14,290
He was the bigger nerd.

3082
02:13:15,010 --> 02:13:17,850
I remember the conductor saying that the train can clean itself.

3083
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:19,470
Though...

3084
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:22,910
I have a feeling the train company just didn't want to hire any janitors.

3085
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:23,890
I mean like...

3086
02:13:23,890 --> 02:13:27,170
Why would you need to hire janitors when literally the train does it for you?

3087
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:27,510
Like...

3088
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:28,550
It doesn't even get paid.

3089
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:31,130
Robots don't need to get paid because they don't have rights.

3090
02:13:32,650 --> 02:13:38,830
The robotic arms can also detect weapons or explosive beams brought onto the...

3091
02:13:38,830 --> 02:13:39,810
Onto the...

3092
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:40,190
Onto the train.

3093
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:42,450
Ensuring passenger safety.

3094
02:13:43,630 --> 02:13:45,770
Seems like SPO A stack question.

3095
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:47,950
Jokey made of FPSV tube.

3096
02:13:48,130 --> 02:13:49,250
Hit him with another one.

3097
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:50,110
Oh my god.

3098
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:50,690
We know.

3099
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:52,130
We know already.

3100
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:54,110
We don't need to hit him with another one.

3101
02:13:54,550 --> 02:13:55,290
Oh my god.

3102
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:55,650
Tails.

3103
02:13:56,550 --> 02:13:58,510
He definitely knows what he's talking about.

3104
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:00,550
I'm giving him literally a random fucking page.

3105
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:05,230
What is a Mirage Express cancellation policy?

3106
02:14:07,110 --> 02:14:08,230
No refunds.

3107
02:14:08,230 --> 02:14:09,790
And you will be charged a no refund.

3108
02:14:09,810 --> 02:14:10,710
No show fee.

3109
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:15,290
This does not apply if you're over the age of 65.

3110
02:14:16,990 --> 02:14:17,510
Gee.

3111
02:14:17,690 --> 02:14:20,710
The person who made this rule must have been over 65.

3112
02:14:21,590 --> 02:14:23,010
He was like 66.

3113
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:25,750
Last one.

3114
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:27,450
Jokey made of FPSV tube.

3115
02:14:27,610 --> 02:14:30,030
Let's see if SPO can go three up for three.

3116
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:30,350
Cut.

3117
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:33,150
After the first one it should be okay, Tess.

3118
02:14:33,730 --> 02:14:34,770
Oh my god.

3119
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:38,170
Don't be jealous that he's a bigger fucking nerd than you are.

3120
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:39,310
Like...

3121
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:43,110
Alright, 402.

3122
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:49,770
What was implemented to support the conductor duties and his general train obligation?

3123
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:53,310
An intelligent data processing system.

3124
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:58,470
It works in tandem with the conductor to ensure smooth travel for guests.

3125
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:01,190
I remember this.

3126
02:15:01,350 --> 02:15:08,410
The train has an autopilot, but it can't access its full suite of capabilities without the conductor present.

3127
02:15:09,330 --> 02:15:11,970
Now, that passed your little test.

3128
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:13,850
No.

3129
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:15,390
No, I don't want to keep going.

3130
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:16,210
Yes.

3131
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:17,770
Totally.

3132
02:15:17,970 --> 02:15:21,450
It's wild you're able to retain all this information so quickly.

3133
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:24,530
A poet's brain is often surprising.

3134
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:28,030
I don't know if I'd be bragging about that.

3135
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:31,330
Clearly read the manual.

3136
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:35,150
Those answers feel far too specific to me.

3137
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:36,090
Oh my god.

3138
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:36,590
Tails.

3139
02:15:36,590 --> 02:15:38,110
Just accept it.

3140
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:40,550
He's a bigger nerd than you.

3141
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:41,870
Oh my god.

3142
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:42,870
Tails.

3143
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:47,290
And you both had the nerve to question my buddy like that.

3144
02:15:47,950 --> 02:15:50,210
Don't we want to be supportive folks who read?

3145
02:15:50,530 --> 02:15:52,090
You don't even read, Vector.

3146
02:15:53,130 --> 02:16:01,450
You have to admit though, reading the entire time a murder occurred does sound a bit suspicious, even if it's true.

3147
02:16:02,170 --> 02:16:05,090
We answered all my questions so calmly.

3148
02:16:05,090 --> 02:16:06,730
That's very impressive.

3149
02:16:08,150 --> 02:16:09,030
No, no.

3150
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:11,950
I understand everyone's cautious attitudes.

3151
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:15,570
Vector was the only one to see me reading after all.

3152
02:16:15,770 --> 02:16:19,970
My alibi is hard to substantiate despite being the truth.

3153
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:24,770
Well, definitely read through the manual.

3154
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:27,910
So I suppose we can...

3155
02:16:27,910 --> 02:16:29,570
Espio, is that true?

3156
02:16:30,150 --> 02:16:32,510
Vector was the only one to see you reading?

3157
02:16:33,630 --> 02:16:34,230
Yes.

3158
02:16:34,230 --> 02:16:35,250
That's correct.

3159
02:16:35,350 --> 02:16:35,950
Wait, what about Rouge?

3160
02:16:36,310 --> 02:16:37,850
Wait, Rouge see me read?

3161
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:41,070
Frankly, I don't believe that can be true.

3162
02:16:41,310 --> 02:16:45,010
And we have evidence to back it up.

3163
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:47,410
Doki made an FPSB2.

3164
02:16:47,550 --> 02:16:47,930
Wait, we do?

3165
02:16:48,990 --> 02:16:51,230
He always puts me on the spot.

3166
02:16:51,350 --> 02:16:51,870
We do?

3167
02:16:55,530 --> 02:16:57,630
Who else saw Espio reading?

3168
02:17:02,310 --> 02:17:03,350
I guess...

3169
02:17:03,350 --> 02:17:04,130
the map.

3170
02:17:14,010 --> 02:17:15,010
Oh, Shadow...

3171
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:16,010
Wait, what about the menu?

3172
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:17,490
Not sure what you're trying to say, that.

3173
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:18,550
Don't waste my time.

3174
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:21,110
But what if people are hungry?

3175
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:23,030
Okay, Shadow's blog.

3176
02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:24,370
Shadow's blog?

3177
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:26,450
Please, pray tell me.

3178
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:29,130
What does that have to do with anything?

3179
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:33,450
We're up, Doki made an FPSB2.

3180
02:17:33,890 --> 02:17:35,070
Let's get our arguments.

3181
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,570
We're back in the tournament together!

3182
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:39,630
Okay, are you also playing this little game while we're thinking too, Tez?

3183
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:41,890
Do we both have any dream gear?

3184
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:44,450
It's okay.

3185
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:46,050
I figured it out.

3186
02:17:47,410 --> 02:17:47,850
Alright.

3187
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:50,410
It's okay, I'm thinking right now.

3188
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:52,530
Guys, this is what happens in my brain.

3189
02:17:52,770 --> 02:17:55,890
You guys are like, what is going on in that little tomato brain of hers?

3190
02:17:56,130 --> 02:17:57,150
This is what happens.

3191
02:17:57,210 --> 02:17:58,450
I'm playing a little Sonic game.

3192
02:18:01,130 --> 02:18:02,930
Oh my gosh, I'm doing so well.

3193
02:18:02,930 --> 02:18:03,850
Yay!

3194
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:06,430
Yay!

3195
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:10,050
Oh my god, this is like longer than before.

3196
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:11,810
Alright, nice.

3197
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:14,610
I got 23 more.

3198
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:16,470
Just like me.

3199
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:18,290
This is how my brain works on Sonic.

3200
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:33,690
I scored for long.

3201
02:18:35,570 --> 02:18:38,150
Crocs are natural gamers.

3202
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:42,230
Espio said he saw Shadow enter the library car.

3203
02:18:43,130 --> 02:18:45,590
But, he's mentioned nothing about Shadow's return.

3204
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:48,790
He only mentioned that Vector came back.

3205
02:18:49,790 --> 02:18:57,930
When Shadow left Knuckles and Vector in the saloon car, Espio was fully seated reading his book for a good while at that point.

3206
02:19:00,310 --> 02:19:02,910
We know Shadow had to walk back.

3207
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:06,530
Back through the library car when he left the saloon car.

3208
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:17,510
So, there's absolutely no way Shadow and Espio didn't notice one another on Shadow's return trip.

3209
02:19:18,330 --> 02:19:18,730
Oh!

3210
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:23,310
He's cooking!

3211
02:19:23,770 --> 02:19:27,330
I mean, it was a simple slip up.

3212
02:19:27,490 --> 02:19:30,350
I was just fully immersed in my book.

3213
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:31,870
That didn't notice Shadow.

3214
02:19:32,050 --> 02:19:32,490
Yep.

3215
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:33,850
That's it.

3216
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:35,930
When nerds attack each other.

3217
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:36,890
Nerd fight!

3218
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:43,390
You're telling me that sound of the door opening and locking wouldn't have caused you to look up?

3219
02:19:43,450 --> 02:19:43,970
Nerd fight!

3220
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:47,210
Well, you see?

3221
02:19:47,450 --> 02:19:48,110
Take that!

3222
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:52,090
I can sense desperation here.

3223
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:55,330
Defending the argument that he was reading the entire time isn't easy.

3224
02:19:56,050 --> 02:20:05,490
So, if you didn't see Shadow returning from the saloon car, and lock all the doors, and at that moment, were you really in the library car at all?

3225
02:20:07,630 --> 02:20:09,150
How would Espio leave?

3226
02:20:09,570 --> 02:20:11,050
Shadow locked all the cars.

3227
02:20:11,290 --> 02:20:13,230
And no one saw Espio in the saloon car.

3228
02:20:13,470 --> 02:20:15,370
She went to the casino!

3229
02:20:17,230 --> 02:20:19,890
It's a mystery, my dear DokimedoFPSV.

3230
02:20:20,410 --> 02:20:20,990
Sorry.

3231
02:20:22,030 --> 02:20:24,830
It's a mystery, my dear DokimedoFPSVTube.

3232
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:28,670
One that I would love for Espio to solve.

3233
02:20:29,070 --> 02:20:29,810
Oh my god!

3234
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:31,070
He was gambling!

3235
02:20:31,650 --> 02:20:32,810
The biggest crime!

3236
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:38,490
Are you even over 21 to gamble, Espio?

3237
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:41,210
You gotta believe me.

3238
02:20:42,370 --> 02:20:44,850
That cool demeanor is vanishing.

3239
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:49,710
I was so involved in my book, I didn't know Shadow passed through the library car.

3240
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:50,710
Honest.

3241
02:20:51,830 --> 02:20:55,570
When Vector returned, he even had to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention.

3242
02:20:56,510 --> 02:20:57,010
Yeah.

3243
02:20:57,070 --> 02:20:58,090
I think I remember.

3244
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:58,770
I think.

3245
02:21:00,330 --> 02:21:02,030
I think I remember doing that.

3246
02:21:05,970 --> 02:21:08,910
I must avenge my friend's death.

3247
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:10,950
So I can ask you again, Espio.

3248
02:21:11,230 --> 02:21:15,570
If you weren't there for Shadow to see you reading, then how did you leave the library car?

3249
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:17,830
I wasn't.

3250
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:19,550
I didn't.

3251
02:21:20,730 --> 02:21:22,470
Why does this seem right to me?

3252
02:21:23,170 --> 02:21:25,410
Tails definitely feels like he's onto something.

3253
02:21:25,810 --> 02:21:27,890
But I don't see it.

3254
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:31,090
Was Espio simply sitting, reading?

3255
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:34,870
Or does he seem to have managed to not notice Shadow's return to the library car?

3256
02:21:35,470 --> 02:21:36,570
What should I do?

3257
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:38,730
Join Tails.

3258
02:21:44,910 --> 02:21:46,230
You know what?

3259
02:21:47,310 --> 02:21:48,150
You know what?

3260
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:50,570
I'm going to be all in on Tails.

3261
02:21:51,010 --> 02:21:51,810
Join Tails.

3262
02:21:52,410 --> 02:21:52,930
No.

3263
02:21:53,070 --> 02:21:55,490
I can't interrupt Tails while he's onto something.

3264
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:58,250
I'll let him continue this lying and questioning end.

3265
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:03,590
A document of FPSVTube.

3266
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:04,730
My fave.

3267
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:05,110
Wait.

3268
02:22:05,230 --> 02:22:07,590
Does he get more and more, like.

3269
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:13,590
Are these real memories or he just made up these memories at this point?

3270
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:16,670
My fave, because I met him like one time.

3271
02:22:17,410 --> 02:22:20,490
My favorite and beloved employee.

3272
02:22:21,490 --> 02:22:22,090
Please.

3273
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:26,030
It doesn't even feel like his actual, like made up flashback.

3274
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:28,150
Protect the past.

3275
02:22:28,210 --> 02:22:28,230
Well done.

3276
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:31,590
Passengers aboard this train.

3277
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:35,910
They must be taken care of.

3278
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:37,290
If you fail.

3279
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:38,150
Oh, yeah.

3280
02:22:38,630 --> 02:22:41,250
The lawsuits will be torturous.

3281
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:46,170
Don't sell out such an old feeble soul to get sued.

3282
02:22:47,610 --> 02:22:49,750
That's gonna be like I just met that guy.

3283
02:22:49,910 --> 02:22:52,170
How do I have so many flashbacks?

3284
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:54,990
I have to make sure our guests are taken care of.

3285
02:22:55,070 --> 02:22:55,670
Oh my gosh.

3286
02:22:55,730 --> 02:22:56,430
I'm hearing voices.

3287
02:22:56,770 --> 02:22:57,990
I have to speak up.

3288
02:22:58,750 --> 02:22:59,190
Tails!

3289
02:23:00,890 --> 02:23:04,030
We have a piece of evidence that can answer all of our problems.

3290
02:23:04,750 --> 02:23:05,930
Alright, my fellow associate.

3291
02:23:06,230 --> 02:23:07,370
Lay it on me.

3292
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:11,510
What piece of evidence shows Shadow and Espo couldn't have seen one another?

3293
02:23:11,910 --> 02:23:13,250
The map!

3294
02:23:15,150 --> 02:23:16,270
Look at the map!

3295
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:20,750
This one because it's my last evidence!

3296
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:23,230
Now, let's get my thoughts in order.

3297
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:24,230
Alright, it's time to game.

3298
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:24,650
Sorry.

3299
02:23:24,730 --> 02:23:25,210
Give me a sec.

3300
02:23:25,310 --> 02:23:26,490
I'm gaming real quick, Tails.

3301
02:23:26,790 --> 02:23:27,390
Don't worry.

3302
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:28,710
Um...

3303
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:32,070
When I'm finished gaming, I'll be able to answer your question.

3304
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:33,190
Uh...

3305
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:36,510
Just...

3306
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:38,590
Just gotta finish gaming now.

3307
02:23:40,430 --> 02:23:40,910
Weee!

3308
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:43,290
Oh my gosh.

3309
02:23:43,390 --> 02:23:43,570
Ooh.

3310
02:23:44,210 --> 02:23:45,310
This is gonna be risky.

3311
02:23:46,250 --> 02:23:46,730
Okay.

3312
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:47,930
I got that.

3313
02:23:48,090 --> 02:23:48,870
Okay, I'm in.

3314
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:50,150
I'm fucking in.

3315
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:51,270
I don't have to worry now.

3316
02:23:52,830 --> 02:23:53,310
Weee!

3317
02:23:54,510 --> 02:23:55,990
I already got seventy- Oh!

3318
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:57,130
Oh, that was scary.

3319
02:23:57,130 --> 02:23:59,010
I wasn't paying attention there.

3320
02:23:59,330 --> 02:23:59,850
It's okay.

3321
02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:01,030
We're set.

3322
02:24:02,430 --> 02:24:02,910
Yay!

3323
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:05,970
I'm gaming.

3324
02:24:06,250 --> 02:24:07,430
Gotta work on those brain cells.

3325
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:09,470
The library map?

3326
02:24:09,770 --> 02:24:10,570
I see!

3327
02:24:11,650 --> 02:24:12,490
See the exits?

3328
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:14,510
They're right across from one another.

3329
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,950
A straight path.

3330
02:24:16,730 --> 02:24:22,310
If Shadow walked down the straight path, there's a way Espo and Shadow couldn't have seen one- Wait, what?

3331
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:24,850
Oh, I guess if he sat there.

3332
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:26,250
Over here.

3333
02:24:26,390 --> 02:24:27,110
And then he goes down the straight path.

3334
02:24:27,130 --> 02:24:27,690
And then he goes this way.

3335
02:24:28,090 --> 02:24:29,910
Yeah, he just needs to sit on that one chair.

3336
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:31,650
Or here.

3337
02:24:32,070 --> 02:24:32,770
No, no, here.

3338
02:24:33,210 --> 02:24:36,550
Looks like you have to point out exactly where on the map.

3339
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:37,750
Map, map, map.

3340
02:24:38,190 --> 02:24:39,390
Uh, you mean...

3341
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:44,510
Where could Espo have been for Shadow to not see him?

3342
02:24:44,630 --> 02:24:45,690
Oh, here!

3343
02:24:47,790 --> 02:24:48,190
Here.

3344
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:49,650
Interesting.

3345
02:24:50,130 --> 02:24:53,450
That's where I was sit- Oh, I thought it was like Espio that not see him.

3346
02:24:53,650 --> 02:24:55,130
Okay, I thought he meant Espio!

3347
02:24:56,010 --> 02:24:56,410
Okay!

3348
02:24:58,610 --> 02:25:03,070
And then I read- Oh, where could he sit for Shadow to not see him.

3349
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:04,010
Interesting.

3350
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:06,150
That's where I was sitting reading my book.

3351
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:08,670
Yeah, of course, that's exactly where.

3352
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:10,290
I can second this!

3353
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:14,470
When I returned from the saloon car, Espio was in the same spot.

3354
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:19,570
I made him like- I made Vector like dumber and dumber the more I voiced him.

3355
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:21,270
That confirms it then.

3356
02:25:21,450 --> 02:25:24,950
You see, Shadow and Espio couldn't have seen one another from this spot.

3357
02:25:26,090 --> 02:25:26,570
Because...

3358
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:27,790
Book is in the way.

3359
02:25:28,010 --> 02:25:30,810
I can't believe I suck my neck out for you, Tez.

3360
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:32,170
I can't believe it.

3361
02:25:32,250 --> 02:25:34,550
You fucking made an innocent chameleon cry.

3362
02:25:35,150 --> 02:25:37,330
I suck my neck for you, man!

3363
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:38,530
I defended you!

3364
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:41,970
There's no way Shadow could've seen Espio.

3365
02:25:42,110 --> 02:25:42,470
There's no way Shadow could've seen Espio.

3366
02:25:42,470 --> 02:25:43,190
Or vice versa!

3367
02:25:44,170 --> 02:25:48,430
It makes a lot of sense why he never mentioned Shadow's return, Espio.

3368
02:25:48,690 --> 02:25:49,090
It makes a lot of sense why he never mentioned Shadow's return, Espio.

3369
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:49,470
It makes a lot of sense why he never mentioned Shadow's return, Espio.

3370
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:51,710
It's just no way you have seen him.

3371
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:53,590
I can't believe I defended you!

3372
02:25:55,770 --> 02:25:58,230
I can't believe it isn't a proven guilty!

3373
02:25:59,630 --> 02:26:02,790
I apologize for losing my cool back there.

3374
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:06,670
I felt like I was grasping despite telling the truth.

3375
02:26:07,670 --> 02:26:09,430
I'm glad y'all believe me now.

3376
02:26:10,210 --> 02:26:13,890
Your alibi isn't the most airtight, but I have no further points.

3377
02:26:14,310 --> 02:26:16,950
I'm sorry I gave you a trauma a little bit.

3378
02:26:18,030 --> 02:26:20,710
Thank you both for answering all our questions.

3379
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:22,910
We did it!

3380
02:26:23,050 --> 02:26:24,610
Another pair of alibis!

3381
02:26:25,330 --> 02:26:25,830
Validated!

3382
02:26:26,530 --> 02:26:27,030
Yeah!

3383
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:28,710
Who the fuck did it?

3384
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:32,170
Too many locked doors to worry about.

3385
02:26:32,330 --> 02:26:39,410
I'm glad everything straight- Okay, I bet you nobody did anything and Sonic just got overdosed with like chili- chili dogs.

3386
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:40,290
I bet you.

3387
02:26:40,530 --> 02:26:41,250
I swear.

3388
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:44,230
Okay, um, quote me on this right now.

3389
02:26:44,350 --> 02:26:49,430
Nobody did anything and Sonic just ate too many chili dogs and passed out.

3390
02:26:50,150 --> 02:26:51,070
I'm exhausted.

3391
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:54,630
I'm gonna crash here for a bit.

3392
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:58,010
Those chairs are soooo comfy.

3393
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:03,470
Likewise, I could use a breather.

3394
02:27:05,250 --> 02:27:07,350
Sadly, our work isn't done.

3395
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:12,290
I have plenty of questions for Rouge and especially Chat.

3396
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:13,070
What about Blaze?

3397
02:27:13,210 --> 02:27:14,830
No one ever said anything about Blaze.

3398
02:27:15,230 --> 02:27:20,890
Like I- I like how no one said- like she's so irrelevant...

3399
02:27:20,890 --> 02:27:25,270
That no one has said anything about Blaze or like Blaze has done anything at all.

3400
02:28:02,390 --> 02:28:07,610
At this point, I'm feeling pretty confident in our detective abilities.

3401
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:10,010
We're really doing this.

3402
02:28:11,250 --> 02:28:14,290
Come on Dokimado FPSVTube.

3403
02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:15,810
Let's see what's next.

3404
02:28:16,590 --> 02:28:17,310
Coming!

3405
02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:19,270
Alright, let's leave.

3406
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:19,350
Let's see.

3407
02:28:19,950 --> 02:28:21,270
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

3408
02:28:21,970 --> 02:28:23,150
The mystery cause.

3409
02:28:24,790 --> 02:28:26,490
Alright, is Amy gonna be in a casino?

3410
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:27,670
Wait!

3411
02:28:27,910 --> 02:28:28,690
Oh my god!

3412
02:28:28,710 --> 02:28:29,630
He has a mustache!

3413
02:28:29,870 --> 02:28:31,310
I thought they were all children!

3414
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:36,580
What the fuck?

3415
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:39,960
Oh, this stuff is getting heavy.

3416
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:42,520
I've dumped what I don't need.

3417
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:44,160
Rouge!

3418
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:45,440
There you are!

3419
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,640
We have a lot of things to say to you!

3420
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:51,100
We visited every train car in the city.

3421
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:55,320
And everyone said they've seen you wandering about.

3422
02:28:56,020 --> 02:28:57,960
It's high time you told us why!

3423
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,180
My, my.

3424
02:29:00,380 --> 02:29:02,840
Talk about a warm welcome.

3425
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:05,400
Quick to a point.

3426
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:07,500
Aren't ya darling?

3427
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:14,040
I see you brought the microwave master with you.

3428
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:15,560
M-M-M-Master?

3429
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:20,140
Please don't let that be my legacy bro.

3430
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:20,720
What the fuck?

3431
02:29:20,740 --> 02:29:21,780
People will kill for that.

3432
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,740
Tails is right.

3433
02:29:24,020 --> 02:29:26,160
Pokes have brought you up a lot.

3434
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:27,800
Care to explain?

3435
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:32,980
Tell him, Rouge.

3436
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,200
We're gonna need that help.

3437
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:39,200
Oh my god, she actually has a role.

3438
02:29:39,460 --> 02:29:43,080
Oh my god, guys!

3439
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:48,960
Blaze actually talks and has a role in this game.

3440
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:51,440
Blaze?

3441
02:29:52,260 --> 02:29:52,820
Alright.

3442
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:55,260
I've been hunting for a treasure.

3443
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:58,020
Rumored to be stored here on the train.

3444
02:29:58,880 --> 02:29:59,600
I knew it!

3445
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:00,220
I knew it was treasure.

3446
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:01,200
It's always something.

3447
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,660
It's always about money.

3448
02:30:03,640 --> 02:30:04,200
Treasure?

3449
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:06,720
She didn't tell me about treasure in the interview.

3450
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:17,000
Since I'm a part business tycoon, part purveyor of fine collectibles, I knew I had to find it.

3451
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:19,960
Tell him what it is, Rouge.

3452
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:21,560
Alright.

3453
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:22,760
Well...

3454
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:26,340
It's a... oh my god, a Fabergé cake.

3455
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,540
I don't understand those.

3456
02:30:27,820 --> 02:30:31,840
Like, people have actually spent like millions on Fabergé eggs.

3457
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:33,260
But like, I don't understand.

3458
02:30:33,460 --> 02:30:36,520
It's just like... it's just like a bedazzled egg.

3459
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:41,660
Like... it's... it's just a fucking bedazzled egg.

3460
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:43,620
Like, I don't understand.

3461
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:45,340
Why are they so popular?

3462
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:47,400
What are those?

3463
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:48,460
What I said?

3464
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:51,080
Eggs with like fucking jewelry on it.

3465
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:54,820
Um... it's a really fucking fancy egg.

3466
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:57,520
Wow, that sounds extravagant.

3467
02:30:59,900 --> 02:31:04,240
Please, don't tell me you accepted Amy's birthday invite only to find that egg.

3468
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:05,560
Don't you care about Amy?

3469
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:09,040
The girl that clearly has a lot of friends?

3470
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,700
Sorry, Amy.

3471
02:31:13,120 --> 02:31:15,320
A woman can have multiple...

3472
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:16,040
Multiple goals.

3473
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:19,380
I gave Amy her birthday present already.

3474
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:22,780
So everything's well taken care of.

3475
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:26,360
Wait, is Blaise French?

3476
02:31:28,180 --> 02:31:30,860
She roped me in on the hunt immediately.

3477
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,140
Okay, I can't do a French accent either.

3478
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,340
Wee wee, she roped me.

3479
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:37,160
Wee wee, mademoiselle.

3480
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:41,740
She roped me in on the hunt immediately.

3481
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:44,600
I stayed here while...

3482
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:47,400
she searched the train cars for clues.

3483
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,840
I deduced that the Fabergé Chaos Eggs is here.

3484
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:57,500
In this train car.

3485
02:31:57,920 --> 02:31:59,280
Locked in a safe.

3486
02:32:00,140 --> 02:32:01,860
Wait, so the treasure is real?

3487
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:03,620
It's actually here?

3488
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:07,520
And what did you manage to find, Rouge?

3489
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:12,140
Well, why don't you both take a look?

3490
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:15,300
Oh, it's like the blueprints.

3491
02:32:15,620 --> 02:32:18,320
I found the blueprints in the library car.

3492
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:20,500
With the safe code written right on it.

3493
02:32:20,620 --> 02:32:22,320
The score of a lifetime.

3494
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,620
The train's blueprints?

3495
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:27,640
Please, Rouge, let us see that.

3496
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:31,280
Uh-uh-uh.

3497
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:33,940
Finders keepers.

3498
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:35,380
Sweetheart.

3499
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:38,520
There's a problem.

3500
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:41,880
We need your assistance.

3501
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,940
You want a child's help?

3502
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,380
What kind of problem?

3503
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:49,960
The elevator behind the security guard...

3504
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:52,060
lead us right to the room...

3505
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:53,580
holding the Fabergé...

3506
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:54,900
Chao Egg.

3507
02:32:54,980 --> 02:32:56,040
Oh, it says Chao.

3508
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:57,200
I thought that...

3509
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:02,800
I thought that says Chaos Egg.

3510
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:03,640
I was like, damn.

3511
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:07,320
I didn't realize they made Chaos Eggs.

3512
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,420
Holy shit.

3513
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:10,740
Oh my god, they...

3514
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:11,860
They've been dancing.

3515
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:13,380
They dazzle the fucking Chao Egg.

3516
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:18,220
But we're not getting anywhere, darling.

3517
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:20,560
With out the guards...

3518
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:20,860
Bro!

3519
02:33:20,940 --> 02:33:21,680
It's a child!

3520
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:22,880
Kick the Chao!

3521
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:24,640
Throw...

3522
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:25,660
Just throw...

3523
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:27,280
Just pick it up and chuck it!

3524
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,840
What is he gonna do?

3525
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:29,660
Fight back?

3526
02:33:30,620 --> 02:33:30,920
Bro!

3527
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:32,720
Fucking throw him in the ocean!

3528
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,340
We need a plan to get that car...

3529
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:36,560
To use the elevator...

3530
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:37,400
And our...

3531
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:39,000
Chance of success grows...

3532
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:39,900
With everyone's help.

3533
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:43,420
Who wants to help you steal the Faberge Chao egg?

3534
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:56,140
Her lower card must be influencing her decisions here.

3535
02:33:57,160 --> 02:34:01,360
Either that, breaking the rules must be refreshing for the princess.

3536
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:11,560
Do not kick the Chao.

3537
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:12,840
Kick the Chao!

3538
02:34:13,980 --> 02:34:16,640
They become rare if you kick the Chao.

3539
02:34:16,820 --> 02:34:18,560
They turn into evil Chaos.

3540
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:19,520
They're rare.

3541
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:24,840
Stealing is for squares.

3542
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:27,800
Damn, I'm so cool.

3543
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:35,780
Stealing is for squares.

3544
02:34:36,560 --> 02:34:39,380
I think the only square here is you.

3545
02:34:39,900 --> 02:34:41,000
Microwave master.

3546
02:34:42,540 --> 02:34:45,620
I must admit, that wasn't the coolest thing I've...

3547
02:34:45,620 --> 02:34:46,420
I'm so cool!

3548
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,020
So cool.

3549
02:34:51,020 --> 02:34:52,900
I heard someone say...

3550
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:57,540
My cool and mysterious reputation is crumbling.

3551
02:34:59,120 --> 02:34:59,940
Alright, alright.

3552
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:00,460
I'm in.

3553
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:00,900
I'll help.

3554
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:02,040
I'm help.

3555
02:35:02,340 --> 02:35:03,560
I'll be a square.

3556
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:07,880
The women say I wasn't cool, so I got peer pressured.

3557
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:09,880
I suppose it will be...

3558
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:12,060
You know how it is when the Blaze and Dokimedo FPSVTube are in?

3559
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:15,060
Okay, let's get that Fabergé Chao egg!

3560
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:18,160
That's the ticket.

3561
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:21,560
Happy to have you both on the team.

3562
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:26,120
Now, we must plan.

3563
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:29,480
Oh my god, we're doing a heist.

3564
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:30,160
It's heist time!

3565
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:33,000
Oh boy, what have we gotten ourselves into?

3566
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:38,340
Access to the Fabergé Chao egg room is behind a locked elevator door.

3567
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:54,880
Why would you agree with that, Rouge?

3568
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:56,800
You have a gun!

3569
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,840
Access the Faberge... okay.

3570
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:02,600
I guess we don't... I don't attack the guard.

3571
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,600
We distract... describe the guard?

3572
02:36:06,380 --> 02:36:07,500
Distract the guard?

3573
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:09,180
What do we distract him by?

3574
02:36:10,060 --> 02:36:11,300
I guess we can like...

3575
02:36:12,440 --> 02:36:12,920
bribe?

3576
02:36:13,740 --> 02:36:15,860
Anyone have anything we can use for a bribe?

3577
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,960
I have a pair of tweezers.

3578
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Here's a trading card!

3579
02:36:21,020 --> 02:36:22,600
I'm not giving you anything.

3580
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:23,700
But you're a princess!

3581
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:24,860
You have stuff!

3582
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:28,280
You can just go back to your other dimension and ask like...

3583
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:30,120
dad to buy you more things!

3584
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:33,100
Maybe bribing isn't the way to go.

3585
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:34,660
We have... oh my god.

3586
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:36,060
But they're the easiest choices.

3587
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:37,480
Bribing is the easiest choice.

3588
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:37,980
Bribing is attacking!

3589
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:40,160
Distract them.

3590
02:36:40,220 --> 02:36:40,620
Perfect!

3591
02:36:40,980 --> 02:36:42,980
We're all charming enough for that to work.

3592
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
That was actually a really nice thing to say.

3593
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,700
Doki Mato FPS B-Tube.

3594
02:36:48,740 --> 02:36:49,460
Is everything okay?

3595
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,200
I've never seen you smile like that.

3596
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,360
Oh my god!

3597
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:52,900
I'm in!

3598
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:53,480
Guys!

3599
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:55,020
I'm in!

3600
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:02,900
Until Sally the squirrel comes over.

3601
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:04,700
Then... then... I'm sorry Rouge.

3602
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:05,540
You're gonna get...

3603
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:07,940
See?

3604
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:10,640
I know my fucking Sonic lore!

3605
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:12,420
I'm just like you guys!

3606
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:18,980
Seems they don't know how to take a compliment.

3607
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:22,140
Hey guys, Sally doesn't...

3608
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:26,560
Wait.

3609
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:27,640
Is she a squirrel?

3610
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:28,500
I don't remember.

3611
02:37:28,620 --> 02:37:28,800
Wait.

3612
02:37:28,980 --> 02:37:30,400
Maybe I'm not in.

3613
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:35,500
No, she is!

3614
02:37:35,500 --> 02:37:36,860
I'm fully committing.

3615
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:38,620
She doesn't wear pants.

3616
02:37:42,460 --> 02:37:44,520
Chick buck squirrel!

3617
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:46,020
I was half in.

3618
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:48,260
I was half right.

3619
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:51,660
Wait.

3620
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:53,040
She isn't catting?

3621
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:55,460
Is it because she doesn't wear pants?

3622
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:57,100
But they don't...

3623
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:59,060
Fucking Tails doesn't wear pants!

3624
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:02,940
Alright.

3625
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:09,160
If I'm gonna be in a casino, my poker face needs work.

3626
02:38:10,980 --> 02:38:12,500
Who's distracting the...

3627
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:13,460
Rouge wore pants?

3628
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:14,180
Look!

3629
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:14,680
That's pants!

3630
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:17,440
Who's distracting...

3631
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:18,520
Well, obviously Rouge, right?

3632
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:20,480
Rouge.

3633
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:22,680
Of course I'll distract him.

3634
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:25,680
Who can resist my venom and charms?

3635
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:29,040
I'm not sure how to...

3636
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:30,840
affect your charms beyond a chow.

3637
02:38:31,900 --> 02:38:34,140
Plus, your flight might prove useful.

3638
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:37,340
I'm not sure you bring distraction makes sense.

3639
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:38,900
I'm not sure you bring distraction makes sense.

3640
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:39,260
Fair enough.

3641
02:38:39,460 --> 02:38:40,420
Let's think it over again.

3642
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:40,720
Wait.

3643
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:41,900
Who else is gonna be distracting?

3644
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:44,720
Tails?

3645
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:46,760
I mean, he's useless in everything else, right?

3646
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:49,380
Sure, I could be the distraction!

3647
02:38:50,020 --> 02:38:51,720
I don't like the way you said that.

3648
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:52,600
Okay!

3649
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:53,700
Then Blaze!

3650
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:55,740
Oh my god!

3651
02:38:56,860 --> 02:38:59,040
No, I really could do it!

3652
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:00,480
Sorry buddy.

3653
02:39:00,620 --> 02:39:01,500
I think you'll be better off.

3654
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:02,200
Okay, Blaze!

3655
02:39:05,060 --> 02:39:06,060
I don't know!

3656
02:39:06,340 --> 02:39:08,340
They're all distracting enough!

3657
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:13,600
You can distract a guard, Blaze?

3658
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:18,380
In my life, I've never let a single person down!

3659
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,320
I won't falter.

3660
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:21,760
I won't falter.

3661
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:23,140
Upgrade her voice.

3662
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:25,440
Oh wait, she was stoic this entire time?

3663
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:26,280
Oh fuck, okay.

3664
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:29,040
Sorry, I gave her too much pressure.

3665
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:29,560
I'm not a personality.

3666
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:32,860
Her voice was so stoic, I have chills.

3667
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:34,520
I guess...

3668
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:36,760
I guess, yeah, she looks like Raven.

3669
02:39:36,940 --> 02:39:37,980
So, you're right.

3670
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:44,180
She looks like Raven, so I should have fucking...

3671
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:45,280
I should have known.

3672
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:47,960
Well, I trust her.

3673
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:50,000
Moving on...

3674
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:51,840
What's the distraction?

3675
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:54,920
Uhhhh...

3676
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:57,000
Uh...

3677
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:58,980
About their partner and kids...

3678
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:02,540
Push a bunch of poker chips to the floor?

3679
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:04,100
Okay, yeah.

3680
02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:06,660
I'll be like, Oh, Mr. Chow...

3681
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:09,260
I'm so dumb...

3682
02:40:09,260 --> 02:40:13,580
The claw machine is stuck...

3683
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:14,900
The claw machine is stuck...

3684
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:15,080
The claw machine is stuck...

3685
02:40:16,180 --> 02:40:17,020
Excuse me!

3686
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:22,420
Wait, there's no claw machine in the casino?

3687
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,800
Wait, there's no claw machine in the casino?

3688
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:25,120
I'm not a distraction!

3689
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:26,420
Let's continue the plan!

3690
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:30,300
Sumimasen...

3691
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:32,980
Mr. Chow...

3692
02:40:32,980 --> 02:40:34,660
The card distracted!

3693
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:37,740
Rouge, how would you get the access card?

3694
02:40:41,140 --> 02:40:42,580
The card distracted!

3695
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:42,860
The card distracted!

3696
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:43,920
Okay, pick their pocket.

3697
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:47,220
I'll snatch the access key, no problem.

3698
02:40:47,480 --> 02:40:50,840
The chow in uniform won't notice a thing.

3699
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:51,500
The chow in uniform won't notice a thing.

3700
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,300
The chow in uniform won't notice a thing.

3701
02:40:54,300 --> 02:40:57,260
Rouge, try not to take anything else from them.

3702
02:40:57,360 --> 02:40:59,060
If you can help it.

3703
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:01,520
No promises.

3704
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:04,380
The card obtained.

3705
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:06,860
We need to get Blaze out of there.

3706
02:41:07,300 --> 02:41:09,840
Dokimedo, FPSVTube, what's your plan?

3707
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:11,480
Um...

3708
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:13,880
Push the security guard over.

3709
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:18,180
I'm still not comfortable.

3710
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:20,200
It's just a little push.

3711
02:41:20,840 --> 02:41:22,700
That chow is low to the ground.

3712
02:41:22,860 --> 02:41:24,280
It won't hurt them.

3713
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:25,540
But...

3714
02:41:25,540 --> 02:41:27,200
What if they start crying?

3715
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:30,260
It'd bring unwanted attention to us.

3716
02:41:30,440 --> 02:41:31,180
Was that accurate?

3717
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:32,660
Was that accurate to Blaze?

3718
02:41:34,090 --> 02:41:37,420
Why does someone who cries so easily a security guard anyway?

3719
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:38,000
Exactly!

3720
02:41:40,070 --> 02:41:40,720
Decent point.

3721
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:42,320
Let's think of something else.

3722
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,240
Fucking cowards!

3723
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:45,420
You guys are cowards!

3724
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:46,800
Alright.

3725
02:41:50,070 --> 02:41:52,160
Say there's a drink without a coaster.

3726
02:41:53,240 --> 02:41:53,860
Absolutely!

3727
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:58,320
I can't think of anything worse!

3728
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:00,520
Despicable.

3729
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:04,580
I would never allow such a thing in my kingdom.

3730
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:05,600
I would never allow such a thing in my kingdom.

3731
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:09,860
The guard will go running immediately.

3732
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:11,940
I'm sure of it.

3733
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:14,160
Great.

3734
02:42:14,300 --> 02:42:18,800
And with the guard distracted, we'll all head to the elevator.

3735
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:23,300
And just like that, we all make it to the elevator.

3736
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:23,560
We all make it to the elevator.

3737
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:26,300
Inside we have...

3738
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:27,540
I don't know.

3739
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:28,860
Sing victory acapella?

3740
02:42:30,020 --> 02:42:32,240
Now that's a proper victory!

3741
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:33,620
Now that's a proper victory!

3742
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:34,600
Oh no.

3743
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:37,620
One last security measure we didn't account for.

3744
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:38,180
Wait, what?

3745
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:40,200
We missed the spouse route?

3746
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:43,560
I'm pretty sure they're like, they're like rejected.

3747
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:46,440
They reject every... I chose like the worst idea.

3748
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:49,340
Because they actually rejected every bad idea.

3749
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:51,340
Every amazing idea I had.

3750
02:42:51,660 --> 02:42:54,280
What do we do about the mechanical arms attacking from the elevator?

3751
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:54,740
I'm gonna give me a ceiling.

3752
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:57,380
Uh, high five.

3753
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:00,140
The end of those arms are closed!

3754
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:01,500
I'm not touching him!

3755
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:05,640
My high fives aren't giving away willy nilly.

3756
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:08,100
They are to be cherished.

3757
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:12,640
I don't think my hands would survive a high five from them unless we think this.

3758
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:12,900
See?

3759
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:14,900
It's such a great idea!

3760
02:43:15,420 --> 02:43:17,620
They never like my good ideas!

3761
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:20,540
Why ask for my opinion?

3762
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:26,780
I should be able to disengage them.

3763
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:28,120
I'll just need some time.

3764
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:31,140
That leads us nicely to our next question.

3765
02:43:31,820 --> 02:43:32,560
Oh no.

3766
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:35,500
Tails is taking a while and the arms are tightening their grip.

3767
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:36,320
Oh my god!

3768
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:37,600
Am I getting choked?

3769
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:42,060
Why am I the one getting choked?

3770
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:43,980
What the fuck?

3771
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:46,680
Everyone else is okay?

3772
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:48,540
Everyone else is okay?

3773
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:48,680
Everyone else is okay?

3774
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:50,320
Everyone else is okay?

3775
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:51,460
Um...

3776
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:53,920
Uh...

3777
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,460
Cry.

3778
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:57,820
Tails managed to do it!

3779
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:04,080
Darlings, I'm happy to say this plan is perfect.

3780
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:08,640
If everyone is ready, it's time to execute.

3781
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:11,460
I'm ready.

3782
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:12,700
Let's begin.

3783
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:16,180
Alright, let's see what's up that elevator!

3784
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:18,280
Alright, let's do it.

3785
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:19,000
Did I do it?

3786
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:21,660
I did it!

3787
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:22,200
Yeah!

3788
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:25,540
Yeah!

3789
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,380
I did it!

3790
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:35,920
I knew the plan would go without a hitch.

3791
02:44:36,100 --> 02:44:37,160
So fucking easy.

3792
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:41,780
We couldn't have made it this far without you both.

3793
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:43,400
You have my gratitude.

3794
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:46,760
Our planning beforehand was very thorough.

3795
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:50,200
I must admit and it was executed to perfection.

3796
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:52,720
Enough chatter.

3797
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:54,620
Now we claim our real prize.

3798
02:44:54,980 --> 02:44:58,680
I have the safe code right here on these blueprints.

3799
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:01,980
Let's claim our Faberge Chao egg.

3800
02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:03,220
Alright.

3801
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:05,880
So this one?

3802
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:08,020
No question.

3803
02:45:08,240 --> 02:45:10,300
This has got to be a safe with our treasure.

3804
02:45:11,460 --> 02:45:12,980
Entering the code on the blueprints.

3805
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:13,440
Oh wait.

3806
02:45:13,640 --> 02:45:16,260
Entering the code on the blueprints and find out Rouge.

3807
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:18,280
Oh, and it's Sweetheart.

3808
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:19,220
Let's see.

3809
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:20,300
23.3.

3810
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:21,900
04.01.

3811
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:23,640
Yeah!

3812
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:28,440
What if it hatches?

3813
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:29,940
It's here.

3814
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:30,880
Haha!

3815
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:31,980
I have it!

3816
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:34,780
It's so ugly!

3817
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:38,320
Alright, before anyone else is seen, let's get it out of here.

3818
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:40,780
Hold on kiddo.

3819
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:42,720
You can't be so hasty.

3820
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:46,180
You truly think that's all there is to this egg?

3821
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:48,100
The egg is real!

3822
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:52,960
I know if the printer sees this, it's a secret.

3823
02:45:53,720 --> 02:45:55,940
Rouge, spit it out.

3824
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:57,220
What are you hiding?

3825
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:00,300
Only three of these eggs were ever made.

3826
02:46:00,460 --> 02:46:04,280
Each hiding their own individual secret.

3827
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:05,820
I like secrets.

3828
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:07,700
No one knows the secret.

3829
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:13,100
Because anyone who's opened one of these has never lived to tell the tale.

3830
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:15,560
Doki!

3831
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:17,580
Doki Mato FPSV Tube.

3832
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:18,180
Open it.

3833
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:20,460
You can open the egg?

3834
02:46:20,700 --> 02:46:21,040
Yes.

3835
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:21,860
It's a fucking egg.

3836
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:24,380
Do you not see the gold thing right here?

3837
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:26,100
Oh my god, Tess.

3838
02:46:26,460 --> 02:46:29,800
You're like a genius but yet you're so fucking stupid sometimes.

3839
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:32,100
Yeah, sure I can.

3840
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:35,220
And all of you will bear witness to its secret.

3841
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:38,640
Rouge, I don't know if you should.

3842
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:42,480
All you need to do is twist it.

3843
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:47,220
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

3844
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:53,320
Oh maybe that's why no one fucking... no one fucking lived because they died.

3845
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:54,160
Is this a bomb?

3846
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:55,840
Huh?

3847
02:46:56,100 --> 02:46:58,240
Why do we have a bomb on a fucking train?

3848
02:46:59,720 --> 02:47:03,800
Wait, I thought like the robot arms made sure we don't have bombs in this train.

3849
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:05,240
Uh oh.

3850
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:09,980
Rouge, has no one lived to tell the egg's secret?

3851
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:12,620
Because each egg is a bomb?

3852
02:47:14,480 --> 02:47:15,000
Huh?

3853
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:17,160
I think you're onto something, kid.

3854
02:47:17,380 --> 02:47:18,680
It sure sounds like a bomb.

3855
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:22,680
We need to dispose... we need to dispose of that egg now.

3856
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:24,880
Wait, if we throw it in the safe, it'll be fine.

3857
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:25,860
It's like bomb proof.

3858
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,680
Dispose of it?

3859
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:28,740
After our hard work?

3860
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:30,160
Rouge.

3861
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:37,280
Fine, fine.

3862
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:38,640
But what do we do?

3863
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:41,220
Where do I put this thing?

3864
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:43,380
Guys!

3865
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:44,840
Enough talking!

3866
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:47,280
Just fucking throw the bomb!

3867
02:47:48,020 --> 02:47:49,920
Why are we still talking?

3868
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:53,580
That's an excellent question.

3869
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,520
What do we do with it?

3870
02:47:55,600 --> 02:47:55,840
Whoa!

3871
02:47:59,920 --> 02:48:02,280
Oh my god, there's a lot of...

3872
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:04,300
Tell the egg to stop.

3873
02:48:05,940 --> 02:48:06,420
Stop.

3874
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:10,680
That's it.

3875
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:11,020
Nothing.

3876
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:13,200
I can't believe I just did that.

3877
02:48:16,700 --> 02:48:18,280
Okay, take one for the team.

3878
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:18,820
Let's do it.

3879
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:19,840
I'm gonna do it.

3880
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,580
Give it to me!

3881
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:22,280
I'm gonna be a hero!

3882
02:48:23,420 --> 02:48:25,140
Get away from this far spot.

3883
02:48:25,240 --> 02:48:28,120
Just remember me as I am a hero!

3884
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:30,160
No!

3885
02:48:30,160 --> 02:48:33,160
Doki, Mato, FPSV2, we won't let you do it!

3886
02:48:33,720 --> 02:48:35,820
I mean, that's what they want.

3887
02:48:35,940 --> 02:48:39,200
Who are we to stop the microwave kids?

3888
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:41,400
Obviously not going to sacrifice themselves.

3889
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:45,120
Their body's far too scrawny to contain... Oh!

3890
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:51,160
Just because I'm a tomato doesn't mean I won't be able to shield us from the fucking blast.

3891
02:48:52,500 --> 02:48:53,060
True.

3892
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:55,800
Let's think of something else quickly.

3893
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:58,780
Okay, clearly it doesn't work.

3894
02:48:59,020 --> 02:48:59,280
Okay.

3895
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:02,160
Have Blaze stomp on the egg.

3896
02:49:05,720 --> 02:49:06,280
Okay.

3897
02:49:06,680 --> 02:49:07,240
Okay.

3898
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:07,660
Throw it.

3899
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:08,440
Lock it in the safe.

3900
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:09,180
Quick!

3901
02:49:09,260 --> 02:49:10,640
Put the egg back, Rouge!

3902
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:12,880
It's fine!

3903
02:49:13,080 --> 02:49:14,260
It's going back in!

3904
02:49:15,640 --> 02:49:15,920
Huh?

3905
02:49:16,360 --> 02:49:18,380
The safe won't lock.

3906
02:49:18,540 --> 02:49:20,480
The door's staying open.

3907
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:23,280
Close the door and twist the dial!

3908
02:49:23,940 --> 02:49:25,000
I obviously am!

3909
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:27,500
There must be some weird way to re-lock the door!

3910
02:49:28,340 --> 02:49:28,740
Please!

3911
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:30,740
There's no other buttons or dials!

3912
02:49:30,740 --> 02:49:31,740
How are we supposed to...

3913
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:33,820
Don't have time to mess with this.

3914
02:49:33,900 --> 02:49:35,000
Think of something else.

3915
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:36,140
Oh my god!

3916
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:36,780
It wasn't that!

3917
02:49:36,940 --> 02:49:38,020
That seemed like the...

3918
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:39,000
Oh, this is a mistake.

3919
02:49:39,180 --> 02:49:39,720
Let's fuck it.

3920
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:40,860
If we die, we die.

3921
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:42,540
Are you insane?

3922
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:45,920
Do you want us to... If we die, we die!

3923
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:49,420
We need to dis...

3924
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:51,060
We need to dispose of the bomb.

3925
02:49:51,560 --> 02:49:53,220
Dokimedo FPS VTube.

3926
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:54,880
That is our goal.

3927
02:49:55,540 --> 02:49:56,960
Listen, I get that.

3928
02:49:57,120 --> 02:49:57,660
But!

3929
02:49:57,660 --> 02:49:58,400
Hear me out!

3930
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:03,860
What if the egg isn't a bomb?

3931
02:50:05,220 --> 02:50:05,780
Wait.

3932
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:07,180
That's right!

3933
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:10,200
Dokimedo FPS VTube!

3934
02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:11,700
I think you're on to something!

3935
02:50:12,040 --> 02:50:13,180
Oh my god, I was cooking!

3936
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:16,060
What's right?

3937
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:18,020
Spit it out kiddo!

3938
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:19,280
We don't have any time!

3939
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:20,940
Okay, we clearly had a lot of time.

3940
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,020
There was a lot of options.

3941
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:24,220
Like, we had so much fucking time.

3942
02:50:25,240 --> 02:50:25,720
Sorry.

3943
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:26,660
It's just...

3944
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:30,820
SPL did say something interesting when we quizzed them about the train's manual.

3945
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:32,400
Wait, we did?

3946
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:33,140
What did he say?

3947
02:50:34,380 --> 02:50:40,160
Um, what's efficient and extremely accurate technology and solid to assist in keeping the train spotless?

3948
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,000
Robotic...

3949
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:42,620
Wait!

3950
02:50:43,100 --> 02:50:44,400
Are you telling me?

3951
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:46,440
It was an illusion of choice?

3952
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:48,780
Whatever page I asked for?

3953
02:50:50,360 --> 02:50:52,780
They can perform a variety of tasks.

3954
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:53,600
Yeah, I said that!

3955
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:54,800
I remember!

3956
02:50:55,100 --> 02:50:59,540
I was like, when the robotic arms know about the fucking bomb, it can't be a bomb!

3957
02:50:59,720 --> 02:51:00,340
I knew it!

3958
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:00,980
I called it!

3959
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:01,860
I was so smart.

3960
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:05,160
I told you I remember things.

3961
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:07,080
Those robotic arms.

3962
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:08,400
In fact, I touched this in the elevator.

3963
02:51:08,660 --> 02:51:10,480
Seems to have a lot of functions here on the train.

3964
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:12,580
I remembered.

3965
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:16,940
If a bomb was brought onto a train, the skies would be as bright as a strawberry egg.

3966
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:19,440
The arms should have detected it.

3967
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,680
And would have allowed it on.

3968
02:51:21,220 --> 02:51:24,580
The only other person who knows the coming and going of the train is a conductor.

3969
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:26,820
And he surely wouldn't allow such a thing either.

3970
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:28,000
Wait, that's me.

3971
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:29,560
So we're out of options.

3972
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:31,780
Sorry I impersonated you a little bit, Tails.

3973
02:51:31,960 --> 02:51:32,880
I think we should wait.

3974
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:34,040
And see what happens.

3975
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:38,640
Okay, we wait.

3976
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:43,780
I like the voice plays the most, I think.

3977
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:45,040
Okay.

3978
02:51:46,340 --> 02:51:46,900
Oh!

3979
02:51:54,050 --> 02:51:54,930
The egg!

3980
02:51:55,050 --> 02:51:55,810
It opened!

3981
02:51:56,110 --> 02:51:56,890
It's hollow!

3982
02:51:57,530 --> 02:51:58,850
It's not a bomb at all!

3983
02:51:59,630 --> 02:52:01,570
You both really were onto something!

3984
02:52:02,210 --> 02:52:02,770
Phew!

3985
02:52:03,810 --> 02:52:04,670
My, my.

3986
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:07,130
That's one way to get the heart racing.

3987
02:52:07,970 --> 02:52:09,410
I'm completely relieved.

3988
02:52:09,930 --> 02:52:10,330
Oh, sorry.

3989
02:52:10,530 --> 02:52:12,050
That had a little bit too much emotion.

3990
02:52:12,410 --> 02:52:13,810
I'm completely relieved.

3991
02:52:15,970 --> 02:52:16,530
Sorry.

3992
02:52:16,790 --> 02:52:18,690
I had a little intonation in there.

3993
02:52:19,550 --> 02:52:20,650
My hunch was right.

3994
02:52:20,750 --> 02:52:21,230
Thankfully.

3995
02:52:25,740 --> 02:52:27,160
Ah, what's inside?

3996
02:52:28,320 --> 02:52:30,180
Oh, bling bling!

3997
02:52:30,840 --> 02:52:32,100
Bedazzled chow!

3998
02:52:32,800 --> 02:52:36,160
Look at that sparkle and it's so heavy too!

3999
02:52:36,660 --> 02:52:38,060
Bling bling!

4000
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:48,580
Bling bong bong bling bong bong bong bling bong bong bong The final secret to the Fabergé chow egg is a chow covered in gems!

4001
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:51,840
That's a bedazzled chow!

4002
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:57,640
It's perfect It's exquisite It's revolutionary!

4003
02:52:58,540 --> 02:53:00,560
And it's worth a lot of money!

4004
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,460
Is she drooling over a sparkly ornament?

4005
02:53:04,380 --> 02:53:06,380
I must admit it is stunning.

4006
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:11,140
Said no one lived to tell the Fabergé chow egg secret.

4007
02:53:11,620 --> 02:53:15,040
I wonder why if the egg wasn't a bomb.

4008
02:53:15,740 --> 02:53:17,980
Because they weren't as tough as us!

4009
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:19,200
I don't know.

4010
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:20,480
Who cares?

4011
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:24,060
What a precious treasure!

4012
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:26,700
A beauty to behold!

4013
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:32,020
Maybe he didn't actually die of old age and just kept the secret with them?

4014
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:32,880
No!

4015
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,520
People keeping secrets?

4016
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:35,980
No!

4017
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:43,440
As much fun as this has been, we should get out of here before we spot it.

4018
02:53:43,780 --> 02:53:44,660
Good call.

4019
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:45,480
Let's go.

4020
02:53:46,660 --> 02:53:47,580
Is that it?

4021
02:53:47,580 --> 02:53:49,980
Do I not even have to interrogate them?

4022
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:53,620
I mean, that's all they've been doing to be fair.

4023
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:54,040
I mean, that's all they've been doing to be fair.

4024
02:53:54,040 --> 02:53:55,560
No one seems to suspect anything.

4025
02:53:56,180 --> 02:53:59,340
And the security guard is back at their post.

4026
02:54:00,680 --> 02:54:03,500
Hope they subdued the drink coaster food okay.

4027
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:06,900
Thank you both for your assistance.

4028
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:10,300
That hunt was exactly the thrill I was seeking.

4029
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:11,760
What about the murder?

4030
02:54:11,960 --> 02:54:13,600
Do we just not care about the murder anymore?

4031
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:14,720
Like, uh...

4032
02:54:14,720 --> 02:54:16,800
Sealing was strangely fun.

4033
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:19,240
But I prefer to never do it again.

4034
02:54:19,740 --> 02:54:20,640
Fucking pussy.

4035
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:22,920
Now, rouge.

4036
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:23,940
Rouge?

4037
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:25,960
Oh my god, what did she see?

4038
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:28,380
She's completely absorbed in that bedazzle.

4039
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:29,980
Oh, she's still looking at the bedazzle chow.

4040
02:54:31,460 --> 02:54:32,880
What is it, darling?

4041
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:34,780
How about those blueprints?

4042
02:54:34,980 --> 02:54:37,760
Now that you're done with them, maybe we could take a look?

4043
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:39,840
Well, I appreciate your assistance.

4044
02:54:41,060 --> 02:54:44,260
It's as I said, finders keepers.

4045
02:54:45,020 --> 02:54:47,560
I'll need them a little longer in case I missed any of them.

4046
02:54:47,580 --> 02:54:48,720
I don't have any other treasures.

4047
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:52,940
But I promise to let you take a peek later.

4048
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:59,300
I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I'm sure you get it, sweetheart.

4049
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:03,720
I hope she's talking to me and not the child.

4050
02:55:06,740 --> 02:55:11,780
You can't just add sweetheart to the end of a sentence to make things better.

4051
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:15,120
But I don't think there's any reason of her.

4052
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:17,100
She's more powerful than me.

4053
02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:17,560
I'm not sure.

4054
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:21,500
Well, we'll get out of your way for now then.

4055
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:25,620
We have a murder mystery to attend to.

4056
02:55:25,620 --> 02:55:27,860
You know, the one for Amy's birthday, guys?

4057
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:28,980
You know.

4058
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:36,220
Before you go, Shadow gave me and Rouge one of these.

4059
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:37,660
We passed through earlier.

4060
02:55:38,540 --> 02:55:39,240
A key!

4061
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:43,400
Let me unlock the door so we can continue forward.

4062
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:47,040
You know, we've had a lot of people mention you, Rouge.

4063
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:50,160
But we also have just as much suspicion about Shadow.

4064
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,760
He's unpredictable.

4065
02:55:54,860 --> 02:55:55,640
That one.

4066
02:55:56,220 --> 02:55:57,820
Good luck to you.

4067
02:55:59,120 --> 02:56:00,120
The door is unlocked.

4068
02:56:00,540 --> 02:56:02,080
Both of you, stay safe.

4069
02:56:02,220 --> 02:56:02,800
Thanks again.

4070
02:56:03,220 --> 02:56:05,400
I like how we're not even interrogating them.

4071
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:06,960
We're just like, yep, they didn't do it.

4072
02:56:08,980 --> 02:56:10,380
The mystery continues.

4073
02:56:11,140 --> 02:56:12,460
They're just like, yep, alright.

4074
02:56:12,460 --> 02:56:13,600
Am I gonna get one guy?

4075
02:56:14,500 --> 02:56:16,560
Tails, we must search the trash bin.

4076
02:56:18,440 --> 02:56:19,320
It's empty.

4077
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:21,780
Did I hear it all?

4078
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:24,180
I've always believed in the thorough investigation.

4079
02:56:24,300 --> 02:56:25,460
Even peeking in the trash.

4080
02:56:25,700 --> 02:56:27,380
See, it's about persistence, Tails.

4081
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:34,080
My dad told me that when he met my mother, he would drive her to work two hours away every Tuesday with flowers from his garden.

4082
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:35,880
She quickly agreed to the date.

4083
02:56:36,340 --> 02:56:37,600
Bro, that's fucking...

4084
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:39,760
Bro, that's weird.

4085
02:56:40,460 --> 02:56:44,940
And when she arrived at the restaurant, she found two dozen roses waiting for her.

4086
02:56:45,360 --> 02:56:47,480
Within a year, the two were married.

4087
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:49,940
It's about caring, dedication, and persistence.

4088
02:56:50,360 --> 02:56:50,860
Yes!

4089
02:56:52,640 --> 02:56:55,680
Whether those was until she says yes.

4090
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,320
It's romance!

4091
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:06,160
That's very sweet.

4092
02:57:06,320 --> 02:57:10,760
But all that's in the bin is a lollipop stick.

4093
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:12,440
A lollipop stick.

4094
02:57:12,460 --> 02:57:13,020
A lollipop stick?

4095
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:15,780
Yeah, like the leftover stick from a lollipop.

4096
02:57:15,900 --> 02:57:16,600
That's all there is.

4097
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,000
Can't believe I got one guy again.

4098
02:57:19,980 --> 02:57:21,660
Doki made a FPSV tube.

4099
02:57:21,780 --> 02:57:23,460
Doki made a FPSV tube.

4100
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:24,660
Is everything okay?

4101
02:57:24,980 --> 02:57:26,900
Do you need me to bring you a flower?

4102
02:57:27,740 --> 02:57:28,620
It's a clue!

4103
02:57:29,220 --> 02:57:29,740
Tails!

4104
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:30,940
It's a clue!

4105
02:57:32,580 --> 02:57:34,000
You don't know that!

4106
02:57:34,780 --> 02:57:35,660
It's a clue!

4107
02:57:36,760 --> 02:57:37,620
Ooh, jackpot.

4108
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:39,820
Oh, nice pinball!

4109
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:44,060
Cheating, cheating, cheating.

4110
02:57:44,540 --> 02:57:45,620
Do you think I can cheat?

4111
02:57:45,900 --> 02:57:47,200
Visit Twinkle Park.

4112
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:51,800
I like how we don't talk about Balan's Wonderland.

4113
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:52,560
Wonderworld?

4114
02:57:53,020 --> 02:57:55,340
Ready to get going?

4115
02:57:55,540 --> 02:57:56,240
Yeah, I am.

4116
02:57:57,580 --> 02:57:58,680
Let's find Shadow.

4117
02:57:58,740 --> 02:58:01,840
We're almost at the end of this murder mystery.

4118
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:04,040
I can gamble?

4119
02:58:04,360 --> 02:58:05,500
Wait, I can gamble?

4120
02:58:06,440 --> 02:58:07,060
Nooooo!

4121
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:09,720
You can play games!

4122
02:58:14,560 --> 02:58:16,620
The Slots!

4123
02:58:16,860 --> 02:58:19,040
Take me back!

4124
02:58:19,740 --> 02:58:21,360
Oh, no.

4125
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:22,420
No!

4126
02:58:23,020 --> 02:58:23,540
No!

4127
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:30,710
No!

4128
02:58:31,610 --> 02:58:32,730
No!

4129
02:58:33,150 --> 02:58:36,030
We can't gamble.

4130
02:58:36,590 --> 02:58:39,030
In front of the child.

4131
02:58:41,490 --> 02:58:44,510
We can't gamble.

4132
02:58:44,690 --> 02:58:45,030
In front of the child.

4133
02:58:45,990 --> 02:58:49,230
We couldn't gamble in front of the child.

4134
02:58:50,070 --> 02:58:53,150
Now's a good time to clean any of my pockets.

4135
02:58:53,810 --> 02:58:54,270
Now's a good time to clean any of my pockets.

4136
02:58:54,750 --> 02:58:56,230
I knew you won't talk.

4137
02:58:56,530 --> 02:58:58,930
I knew exactly why you've been locking those doors.

4138
02:58:59,610 --> 02:59:02,750
It's hard to get a word in as you talk over me, man.

4139
02:59:03,110 --> 02:59:03,270
It's hard to get a word in as you talk over me, man.

4140
02:59:03,650 --> 02:59:05,470
I have my reasons.

4141
02:59:06,270 --> 02:59:06,830
I...

4142
02:59:07,950 --> 02:59:09,730
No reason is convincing enough.

4143
02:59:09,830 --> 02:59:11,750
It's inconceivable what you did.

4144
02:59:12,490 --> 02:59:13,330
Hey, hey, hey!

4145
02:59:13,390 --> 02:59:14,170
What's going on?

4146
02:59:14,230 --> 02:59:14,790
Hey, guys!

4147
02:59:15,050 --> 02:59:15,150
Hey!

4148
02:59:17,530 --> 02:59:19,070
I see you made it here, Tails.

4149
02:59:19,930 --> 02:59:22,510
But I didn't expect the Iron Chef as well.

4150
02:59:23,590 --> 02:59:26,630
We'll see what you say when you microwave chili dogs delicious!

4151
02:59:28,270 --> 02:59:30,630
I'd like to know why you've been locking doors...

4152
02:59:31,470 --> 02:59:33,010
throughout the train shadow.

4153
02:59:36,490 --> 02:59:37,050
Well...

4154
02:59:37,050 --> 02:59:39,370
It seems Amy already knows.

4155
02:59:39,590 --> 02:59:40,550
So ask her.

4156
02:59:42,310 --> 02:59:42,870
Hmmm...

4157
02:59:44,110 --> 02:59:45,470
I'm not saying a thing.

4158
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:47,570
You know, I will have to tell me why.

4159
02:59:48,670 --> 02:59:50,970
Now, if you could leave me be...

4160
02:59:50,970 --> 02:59:53,450
I have an appointment coming up.

4161
02:59:53,470 --> 02:59:53,790
With what?

4162
02:59:54,170 --> 02:59:55,570
You're just a locksmith.

4163
02:59:55,590 --> 02:59:56,710
You don't have any other job.

4164
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:57,570
Be immersive.

4165
02:59:59,050 --> 02:59:59,490
Appointment?

4166
02:59:59,510 --> 03:00:00,890
Yeah, who wants to meet him here?

4167
03:00:01,970 --> 03:00:03,670
Well, Doki made a FPSV tube.

4168
03:00:03,870 --> 03:00:05,710
It seems like Shadow isn't going to talk.

4169
03:00:06,050 --> 03:00:07,530
Let's do some investigating.

4170
03:00:07,850 --> 03:00:09,670
He won't talk until his lawyer's here.

4171
03:00:10,390 --> 03:00:12,470
Alright, ready to find some answers, Tails?

4172
03:00:13,610 --> 03:00:16,090
Indubitably, my dear Doki made a FPSV tube.

4173
03:00:16,850 --> 03:00:17,330
Alright.

4174
03:00:18,430 --> 03:00:20,010
What will make him talk?

4175
03:00:20,910 --> 03:00:21,390
Oh!

4176
03:00:21,610 --> 03:00:23,270
Maybe he has a date!

4177
03:00:23,570 --> 03:00:24,950
Wait, why is there a computer?

4178
03:00:28,110 --> 03:00:28,590
Tails...

4179
03:00:29,350 --> 03:00:29,830
No...

4180
03:00:30,350 --> 03:00:31,890
Tails, I think we should check the trash.

4181
03:00:32,790 --> 03:00:36,310
Every trash bin has been empty, Doki made a FPSV tube.

4182
03:00:36,650 --> 03:00:38,730
And you've been disappointed every time...

4183
03:00:38,730 --> 03:00:39,070
No!

4184
03:00:39,130 --> 03:00:39,650
It'll be Doki's fault!

4185
03:00:39,670 --> 03:00:40,070
This time, it's different!

4186
03:00:40,550 --> 03:00:41,290
This time!

4187
03:00:41,910 --> 03:00:44,550
That one guy can't be right for once!

4188
03:00:44,770 --> 03:00:45,710
There's no way!

4189
03:00:45,970 --> 03:00:48,610
That one guy can't be right for once in his life!

4190
03:00:48,870 --> 03:00:49,990
Are you going to get sad again?

4191
03:00:50,050 --> 03:00:51,370
There's nothing in the trash bin.

4192
03:00:51,450 --> 03:00:52,770
Doki made a FPSV tube.

4193
03:00:54,230 --> 03:00:54,710
Hmm...

4194
03:00:55,750 --> 03:00:57,470
There's always something in the trash bin.

4195
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:01,910
Alright, let's check the trash bin.

4196
03:01:02,070 --> 03:01:02,490
This time.

4197
03:01:02,570 --> 03:01:02,950
This is it.

4198
03:01:02,990 --> 03:01:03,370
This is it.

4199
03:01:03,390 --> 03:01:04,030
This is the one guy.

4200
03:01:05,610 --> 03:01:06,250
What's this?

4201
03:01:07,450 --> 03:01:07,930
Ha!

4202
03:01:10,590 --> 03:01:11,190
It's...

4203
03:01:11,190 --> 03:01:13,570
Someone printed out the front page of a ticket website.

4204
03:01:13,730 --> 03:01:14,950
It's for the band...

4205
03:01:15,550 --> 03:01:16,410
Hot Honey?

4206
03:01:17,270 --> 03:01:17,870
Interesting.

4207
03:01:18,130 --> 03:01:20,310
Hot Honey is one of Amy's favorite bands.

4208
03:01:21,270 --> 03:01:22,550
Oh my god!

4209
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:25,570
Shadow didn't get her a birthday present!

4210
03:01:26,830 --> 03:01:28,270
Let's add it to our inventory.

4211
03:01:29,210 --> 03:01:29,810
Shadow!

4212
03:01:30,790 --> 03:01:32,210
Are you sure this is just...

4213
03:01:32,210 --> 03:01:32,970
trash?

4214
03:01:33,870 --> 03:01:34,890
That is...

4215
03:01:35,570 --> 03:01:36,970
Shadow, I can't believe it.

4216
03:01:37,110 --> 03:01:38,870
I can't believe it, Shadow.

4217
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:41,510
You got it last minute.

4218
03:01:43,550 --> 03:01:46,270
There's always success if you check the trash bin.

4219
03:01:47,010 --> 03:01:49,150
Crumpled paper is added to your inventory.

4220
03:01:49,510 --> 03:01:51,750
I can't believe it, Shadow!

4221
03:01:52,750 --> 03:01:54,750
You didn't fucking...

4222
03:01:54,750 --> 03:01:59,230
You didn't fucking get her a birthday present until you're on the train?

4223
03:02:00,350 --> 03:02:02,330
Better late than never.

4224
03:02:05,710 --> 03:02:06,810
They don't...

4225
03:02:06,810 --> 03:02:08,570
They told us about this interview.

4226
03:02:08,930 --> 03:02:09,650
I don't know.

4227
03:02:09,650 --> 03:02:13,690
The lounge has a computer complete with internet access for casual browsing.

4228
03:02:14,130 --> 03:02:15,110
How lovely.

4229
03:02:15,290 --> 03:02:16,010
Seems convenient.

4230
03:02:16,690 --> 03:02:21,750
It is a shame to be on the computer and missing those gorgeous views though.

4231
03:02:22,210 --> 03:02:23,450
I feel like if you're...

4232
03:02:23,450 --> 03:02:24,850
It's 8pm.

4233
03:02:25,010 --> 03:02:25,890
It's dark.

4234
03:02:27,410 --> 03:02:29,510
You must really need to use it.

4235
03:02:30,550 --> 03:02:31,650
Yes, I...

4236
03:02:31,650 --> 03:02:35,890
My life is now as a tomato playing Sonic the Hedgehog.

4237
03:02:38,130 --> 03:02:39,630
Oh, I thought that was it.

4238
03:02:39,630 --> 03:02:40,230
Okay.

4239
03:02:40,830 --> 03:02:42,970
Wait, maybe the keys?

4240
03:02:43,430 --> 03:02:44,070
Hmm.

4241
03:02:44,830 --> 03:02:45,770
The keys!

4242
03:02:46,210 --> 03:02:47,130
A keyring?

4243
03:02:47,290 --> 03:02:49,550
Must be Shadow's... the locksmith.

4244
03:02:50,530 --> 03:02:51,510
It's interesting.

4245
03:02:51,750 --> 03:02:52,970
There's only two keys.

4246
03:02:53,470 --> 03:02:55,490
I figured a locksmith...

4247
03:02:55,490 --> 03:02:56,430
would have a bunch.

4248
03:02:56,510 --> 03:02:58,010
Wait, didn't he give away all my keys though?

4249
03:02:58,630 --> 03:03:00,050
Wanna take it?

4250
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:02,730
Rough times.

4251
03:03:02,810 --> 03:03:03,750
Thank you for the super chat.

4252
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:06,330
Does that mean Amy is Latina?

4253
03:03:06,590 --> 03:03:07,230
Hahaha.

4254
03:03:07,230 --> 03:03:07,410
Hahaha.

4255
03:03:09,110 --> 03:03:10,770
Keyring is added to your inventory.

4256
03:03:11,810 --> 03:03:13,030
Alright, what else?

4257
03:03:14,830 --> 03:03:15,830
I'm gonna check the door.

4258
03:03:16,770 --> 03:03:17,490
Oh, okay.

4259
03:03:17,730 --> 03:03:18,790
I thought like...

4260
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:21,290
I thought like it would say something.

4261
03:03:21,710 --> 03:03:22,990
Can you open the wardrobe please?

4262
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:24,190
Sure.

4263
03:03:24,930 --> 03:03:26,910
Wait, is there a reason for me to do it?

4264
03:03:27,570 --> 03:03:28,970
What if something falls out?

4265
03:03:29,050 --> 03:03:30,470
Or worse, someone leaps out?

4266
03:03:30,570 --> 03:03:31,790
Or worse, it's a jump scare!

4267
03:03:32,350 --> 03:03:33,590
I just think you should do it.

4268
03:03:34,470 --> 03:03:35,850
Alright, open the wardrobe.

4269
03:03:36,030 --> 03:03:36,530
Wait, tails.

4270
03:03:36,670 --> 03:03:36,850
Yeah.

4271
03:03:37,230 --> 03:03:37,490
Do it.

4272
03:03:37,650 --> 03:03:38,730
Be a man.

4273
03:03:39,030 --> 03:03:39,990
Be a fox man.

4274
03:03:41,410 --> 03:03:42,010
Alright.

4275
03:03:42,570 --> 03:03:43,490
Tough love.

4276
03:03:43,810 --> 03:03:44,650
I'll get it.

4277
03:03:44,690 --> 03:03:46,670
Today you'll become a fox man, Tails.

4278
03:03:47,390 --> 03:03:48,970
Here goes nothing!

4279
03:03:50,090 --> 03:03:50,690
Ah!

4280
03:03:51,850 --> 03:03:53,650
Oh, just some sweaters.

4281
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:54,610
See?

4282
03:03:54,730 --> 03:03:55,710
Not bad, huh?

4283
03:03:56,070 --> 03:03:57,510
Just dusty.

4284
03:03:58,170 --> 03:03:58,770
Haha.

4285
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:00,450
Boo!

4286
03:04:02,330 --> 03:04:02,710
Ah!

4287
03:04:03,050 --> 03:04:03,650
Hahaha.

4288
03:04:04,090 --> 03:04:05,390
Sorry, couldn't help it.

4289
03:04:05,390 --> 03:04:07,430
Doki made a FPS VTuber.

4290
03:04:08,330 --> 03:04:09,150
I'm fragile.

4291
03:04:10,810 --> 03:04:11,330
Okay.

4292
03:04:11,370 --> 03:04:12,990
Clearly it wasn't... Oh wait, what's this?

4293
03:04:14,070 --> 03:04:15,130
Tails, do you see this?

4294
03:04:15,450 --> 03:04:16,090
What is that?

4295
03:04:16,690 --> 03:04:17,650
A pull string?

4296
03:04:18,490 --> 03:04:19,990
Doki made a FPS VTube.

4297
03:04:21,290 --> 03:04:22,510
It's gotta activate something.

4298
03:04:25,530 --> 03:04:26,050
Whoa!

4299
03:04:26,050 --> 03:04:27,430
There's a secret passage!

4300
03:04:28,990 --> 03:04:31,010
There's a full... Okay, she didn't say that.

4301
03:04:31,770 --> 03:04:34,010
There's a full passageway back there!

4302
03:04:34,210 --> 03:04:34,730
There's a full passageway back there!

4303
03:04:35,390 --> 03:04:37,410
Come on, we have to see where this leads.

4304
03:04:38,390 --> 03:04:39,190
He's curious.

4305
03:04:39,250 --> 03:04:40,850
This must mean something big.

4306
03:04:43,570 --> 03:04:44,050
Wait!

4307
03:04:44,410 --> 03:04:45,550
The library!

4308
03:04:47,230 --> 03:04:49,630
There's a secret passageway from the...

4309
03:04:49,630 --> 03:04:51,450
This changes everything!

4310
03:04:53,410 --> 03:04:54,350
Secret tunnel!

4311
03:04:54,650 --> 03:04:55,090
Secret tunnel!

4312
03:04:55,090 --> 03:04:56,130
I don't believe it.

4313
03:04:57,110 --> 03:04:58,650
Wait, how the fuck does that work?

4314
03:04:58,830 --> 03:04:59,790
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

4315
03:05:00,170 --> 03:05:02,510
Oh, there's a... Wait, wait a minute.

4316
03:05:03,370 --> 03:05:03,850
Wait.

4317
03:05:05,390 --> 03:05:06,230
How does...

4318
03:05:06,230 --> 03:05:07,290
Wait...

4319
03:05:08,110 --> 03:05:10,650
If the train is moving...

4320
03:05:10,650 --> 03:05:12,990
How does that work?

4321
03:05:14,350 --> 03:05:18,170
Wait, I'm a little confused now.

4322
03:05:21,790 --> 03:05:24,110
Yeah, but the train is moving.

4323
03:05:24,610 --> 03:05:26,570
So, like, how did the...

4324
03:05:30,570 --> 03:05:31,310
Alright.

4325
03:05:31,570 --> 03:05:33,810
Through the passageway before they spot us.

4326
03:05:38,850 --> 03:05:39,630
I'm confused.

4327
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:40,870
My brain hurts now.

4328
03:05:41,070 --> 03:05:41,650
How the fuck...

4329
03:05:41,650 --> 03:05:42,170
Wait...

4330
03:05:45,430 --> 03:05:45,910
Wait...

4331
03:05:48,190 --> 03:05:49,870
We need to add that to our inventory.

4332
03:05:52,430 --> 03:05:53,390
Hidden passageway.

4333
03:05:53,510 --> 03:05:54,970
Wait, I think I got the clues.

4334
03:05:55,210 --> 03:05:55,390
Yeah!

4335
03:05:55,750 --> 03:05:57,290
It's time to interrogate Shadow.

4336
03:05:58,550 --> 03:05:59,570
Ultimate life form.

4337
03:05:59,610 --> 03:06:00,050
It's time!

4338
03:06:01,350 --> 03:06:03,230
There's nothing I can do to help you.

4339
03:06:03,490 --> 03:06:06,130
There's nothing I can do to help you.

4340
03:06:06,790 --> 03:06:07,910
There's nothing I can do to help you.

4341
03:06:07,910 --> 03:06:08,170
Let me be.

4342
03:06:09,190 --> 03:06:10,110
That stair.

4343
03:06:10,390 --> 03:06:11,250
So cold.

4344
03:06:11,870 --> 03:06:12,350
Burr.

4345
03:06:13,250 --> 03:06:15,730
We will get you... We will get out of here, actually.

4346
03:06:16,750 --> 03:06:18,550
Don't keep me at our FPS, B-Tube!

4347
03:06:18,830 --> 03:06:19,910
We certainly will not!

4348
03:06:20,830 --> 03:06:21,310
Alright.

4349
03:06:21,510 --> 03:06:22,530
Can I take your order?

4350
03:06:23,170 --> 03:06:24,950
I'll take you up on that coffee.

4351
03:06:25,630 --> 03:06:28,870
When I'm back in the dining car, I'll whip that right up.

4352
03:06:29,870 --> 03:06:30,850
Coffee on the train.

4353
03:06:31,510 --> 03:06:33,050
There's no better combination.

4354
03:06:35,250 --> 03:06:35,730
Mmm...

4355
03:06:37,050 --> 03:06:38,970
Some marshmallows will make it perfect.

4356
03:06:39,270 --> 03:06:40,450
Some marshmallows will make it perfect.

4357
03:06:40,450 --> 03:06:41,030
Sure.

4358
03:06:41,810 --> 03:06:43,010
Cause that's...

4359
03:06:43,470 --> 03:06:43,790
edgy.

4360
03:06:46,210 --> 03:06:48,110
Alright, let's actually interrogate him.

4361
03:06:49,730 --> 03:06:51,090
He likes it black.

4362
03:06:51,390 --> 03:06:52,550
Like his soul.

4363
03:06:54,810 --> 03:06:57,050
Shadow, we have questions for you.

4364
03:06:57,990 --> 03:06:58,010
Shadow, we have questions for you.

4365
03:06:58,170 --> 03:06:59,710
Will you three get out?

4366
03:06:59,850 --> 03:07:00,830
I'm busy.

4367
03:07:01,830 --> 03:07:05,710
As I said, I have an appointment at 10.

4368
03:07:05,730 --> 03:07:06,370
10-2.

4369
03:07:07,490 --> 03:07:08,790
Sorry, but this is important.

4370
03:07:09,690 --> 03:07:12,610
Shadow, we've questioned everyone on this train.

4371
03:07:12,770 --> 03:07:15,210
And every single person I've mentioned running into you.

4372
03:07:16,410 --> 03:07:18,790
You've been locking every door in this train.

4373
03:07:19,150 --> 03:07:21,170
And... and I know why.

4374
03:07:21,390 --> 03:07:21,710
Ah!

4375
03:07:25,150 --> 03:07:26,770
Pray tell why.

4376
03:07:26,970 --> 03:07:29,550
I was locking all the doors.

4377
03:07:30,930 --> 03:07:33,890
Time to reveal my hot tip!

4378
03:07:34,630 --> 03:07:38,990
Hope everyone is ready for a scoop found by yours truly.

4379
03:07:40,450 --> 03:07:41,450
We're ready.

4380
03:07:42,190 --> 03:07:46,470
According to the map, the next car is the conductor's car.

4381
03:07:46,810 --> 03:07:48,590
Where Sonic was stationed.

4382
03:07:49,510 --> 03:07:54,170
This door right here in the lounge car is the only car that leads to the conductor's car.

4383
03:07:54,930 --> 03:07:55,570
Following...

4384
03:07:55,570 --> 03:08:00,310
So, Shadow was locking all the doors for one reason and one reason alone.

4385
03:08:00,830 --> 03:08:03,630
To keep Sonic from escaping the conductor car.

4386
03:08:05,690 --> 03:08:08,370
So you think Shadow was trapping Sonic?

4387
03:08:09,370 --> 03:08:10,170
I sure do!

4388
03:08:10,470 --> 03:08:13,710
He locked the conductor's car, then locked all the others.

4389
03:08:13,910 --> 03:08:16,770
So one locked door wasn't suspicious.

4390
03:08:17,610 --> 03:08:18,530
I don't know guys.

4391
03:08:18,790 --> 03:08:19,870
I think Amy's wrong.

4392
03:08:20,150 --> 03:08:21,470
Because it's never the first thing.

4393
03:08:23,890 --> 03:08:25,010
Here, conjecture.

4394
03:08:25,510 --> 03:08:28,450
You all get out and leave me be.

4395
03:08:29,470 --> 03:08:31,710
Well, my source can back up the...

4396
03:08:31,710 --> 03:08:32,550
Who's my source?

4397
03:08:32,790 --> 03:08:33,070
Me?

4398
03:08:33,630 --> 03:08:34,630
Source, trust me.

4399
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:37,730
They remain anonymous, but I think that...

4400
03:08:39,650 --> 03:08:41,410
Source, trust me.

4401
03:08:45,010 --> 03:08:49,930
My source claims they never saw Sonic again after he went into the conductor's car.

4402
03:08:50,230 --> 03:08:50,830
Why?

4403
03:08:51,310 --> 03:08:52,290
Trust me bro.

4404
03:08:52,810 --> 03:08:56,650
Because he was trapped and couldn't leave the conductor's car.

4405
03:08:57,770 --> 03:08:58,950
Reckless speculation.

4406
03:08:59,950 --> 03:09:03,290
This is how you do your detective work.

4407
03:09:03,950 --> 03:09:04,470
Journalist.

4408
03:09:05,430 --> 03:09:07,330
Is the logic sound though?

4409
03:09:07,390 --> 03:09:08,870
Was Shadow trapping...

4410
03:09:09,490 --> 03:09:10,910
Source, it's my birthday.

4411
03:09:13,030 --> 03:09:14,570
I'm right, it's my birthday.

4412
03:09:15,650 --> 03:09:16,450
Happy birthday.

4413
03:09:17,830 --> 03:09:20,210
I'll play along and follow this train of logic, Amy.

4414
03:09:20,830 --> 03:09:23,690
I shall then lock the door to the conductor's car.

4415
03:09:23,870 --> 03:09:24,610
I shall then lock the door to the conductor's car.

4416
03:09:24,610 --> 03:09:25,210
Imprisoning Sonic.

4417
03:09:25,690 --> 03:09:27,870
Then how is Sonic found in the dining car?

4418
03:09:28,850 --> 03:09:29,370
Then how is Sonic found in the dining car?

4419
03:09:30,530 --> 03:09:32,450
I think the ma- I'm sorry.

4420
03:09:34,910 --> 03:09:37,450
TokimatoFPSVtube and I can explain the car change, however.

4421
03:09:41,870 --> 03:09:45,110
TokimatoFPSVtube, what evidence do we have that shows Sonic could have gotten into the dining car?

4422
03:09:45,270 --> 03:09:46,390
Well, obviously it's this.

4423
03:09:46,470 --> 03:09:47,450
Like, what else?

4424
03:09:49,050 --> 03:09:51,050
Or let's do we- Oh yeah, it's this.

4425
03:09:52,030 --> 03:09:54,050
Just get my thoughts in order.

4426
03:09:55,330 --> 03:09:55,770
Think!

4427
03:09:55,830 --> 03:09:56,690
Okay, I got it right.

4428
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:57,350
It's think time.

4429
03:09:57,910 --> 03:09:58,510
Don't worry.

4430
03:09:58,510 --> 03:10:00,490
Just gonna play a little video game, guys.

4431
03:10:00,990 --> 03:10:02,930
Sorry, my mom said I can't pause this game.

4432
03:10:04,050 --> 03:10:04,630
It's okay.

4433
03:10:04,750 --> 03:10:05,050
Boop!

4434
03:10:05,450 --> 03:10:08,330
Oh, there's like no more like- Uh, oh nevermind.

4435
03:10:08,690 --> 03:10:10,270
Oh wait, this is easier!

4436
03:10:10,510 --> 03:10:12,430
This is like easier than the fucking...

4437
03:10:12,430 --> 03:10:15,130
Uh, than the straight line thing.

4438
03:10:15,550 --> 03:10:17,030
Why would this one be easier?

4439
03:10:18,210 --> 03:10:20,490
This is like literally endgame, isn't it?

4440
03:10:21,030 --> 03:10:21,470
Yay!

4441
03:10:22,490 --> 03:10:24,350
Guys, it's easier, I swear.

4442
03:10:36,430 --> 03:10:36,830
What?

4443
03:10:40,490 --> 03:10:41,550
A secret passage?

4444
03:10:41,770 --> 03:10:43,350
Yes, it's literally right in front of us, Amy.

4445
03:10:43,950 --> 03:10:52,030
So someone could have used the passage, snuck through the library car, walked past the distracted boys playing arcade, and safely arrived at the dining car to eat all those chained dogs and then get a food coma?

4446
03:10:53,030 --> 03:10:55,670
Excellent work, DokiMatoFPSVTube.

4447
03:10:57,570 --> 03:10:58,010
Hmm...

4448
03:10:58,010 --> 03:11:00,530
That just my theory- Yeah, just a little bit, by the way.

4449
03:11:01,010 --> 03:11:06,050
The shadow murdered Sonic in the conductor car, but then thought the crime scene being so close to the station was suspicious?

4450
03:11:06,690 --> 03:11:12,150
Shadow picked up Sonic, locked the door to the conductor car on the way out, and dropped the body off at the dining car?

4451
03:11:13,230 --> 03:11:14,610
Happy birthday, it's my birthday!

4452
03:11:15,570 --> 03:11:17,690
Are you officially accusing Shadow of murder?

4453
03:11:18,770 --> 03:11:19,390
I am!

4454
03:11:19,570 --> 03:11:21,850
But of course, this is just a theory.

4455
03:11:22,110 --> 03:11:23,430
A game theory.

4456
03:11:24,410 --> 03:11:29,230
I don't have any evidence to back this up other than my hot scoop.

4457
03:11:30,810 --> 03:11:33,330
Seems Tails and I were more thrilled than you.

4458
03:11:33,750 --> 03:11:33,790
Huh?

4459
03:11:34,370 --> 03:11:35,870
The shadow's not gonna talk.

4460
03:11:36,110 --> 03:11:37,290
Then I'll humor you once again!

4461
03:11:38,110 --> 03:11:41,730
The shadow traveled through the hidden passage and appeared in the library car?

4462
03:11:41,930 --> 03:11:43,230
Then how did S.B.M.

4463
03:11:43,290 --> 03:11:44,770
Vesper not see him?

4464
03:11:46,870 --> 03:11:47,870
Umm... well...

4465
03:11:48,510 --> 03:11:51,070
I suppose it would be hard to sneak around two people.

4466
03:11:53,070 --> 03:11:55,270
DokiMatoFPSVTuber, do you have any guesses?

4467
03:11:55,710 --> 03:11:56,330
Wait, what?

4468
03:11:56,550 --> 03:11:56,890
Okay.

4469
03:11:59,510 --> 03:12:00,030
Because...

4470
03:12:00,030 --> 03:12:01,130
Oh, S.B.O.

4471
03:12:01,210 --> 03:12:01,510
was reading!

4472
03:12:02,290 --> 03:12:03,750
Wait, it's both right.

4473
03:12:04,250 --> 03:12:05,150
Like, S.B.O.

4474
03:12:05,170 --> 03:12:06,330
was reading and...

4475
03:12:07,050 --> 03:12:09,550
Oh, wait, Vector was with Knuckles.

4476
03:12:09,670 --> 03:12:11,090
Yeah, I mean...

4477
03:12:11,090 --> 03:12:12,550
They were...

4478
03:12:14,750 --> 03:12:16,690
Well, Vector was with Knuckles.

4479
03:12:17,230 --> 03:12:17,970
That's true.

4480
03:12:18,150 --> 03:12:22,130
Vector was with Knuckles and would have seen Shadow enter the library car.

4481
03:12:22,650 --> 03:12:23,170
See?

4482
03:12:23,570 --> 03:12:25,210
Things are falling into place.

4483
03:12:25,650 --> 03:12:28,090
But what about S.B.O.?

4484
03:12:28,090 --> 03:12:29,470
I believe S.B.O.

4485
03:12:29,470 --> 03:12:30,830
Yeah, it's an illusion of choice!

4486
03:12:31,050 --> 03:12:32,430
It was both right!

4487
03:12:34,890 --> 03:12:35,650
S.B.O.

4488
03:12:35,650 --> 03:12:36,630
reading in the library checks out.

4489
03:12:36,710 --> 03:12:38,230
That's what he told me too.

4490
03:12:40,190 --> 03:12:41,130
He's lying.

4491
03:12:42,090 --> 03:12:42,610
What?

4492
03:12:42,630 --> 03:12:43,870
What was that, Shadow?

4493
03:12:44,650 --> 03:12:51,810
When I completely obliterated Knuckles and Vector at that whatever game, I left the saloon car.

4494
03:12:52,050 --> 03:12:52,550
What?

4495
03:12:53,570 --> 03:12:54,090
What?

4496
03:12:55,370 --> 03:12:58,770
I spent so much time looking for S.B.O.

4497
03:12:58,770 --> 03:13:00,250
but he was not there.

4498
03:13:00,470 --> 03:13:02,230
He was not in the...

4499
03:13:02,230 --> 03:13:05,230
He was not in the...

4500
03:13:05,230 --> 03:13:06,670
It was the poet?

4501
03:13:07,930 --> 03:13:10,010
Like, I'd believe you.

4502
03:13:10,110 --> 03:13:12,890
You're currently my number one suspect.

4503
03:13:13,150 --> 03:13:13,830
What?

4504
03:13:15,830 --> 03:13:17,790
It wasn't the butler?

4505
03:13:18,430 --> 03:13:22,090
Why were you even searching for S.B.O.?

4506
03:13:22,090 --> 03:13:22,550
Huh?

4507
03:13:23,570 --> 03:13:24,590
Bum Bum!

4508
03:13:27,410 --> 03:13:30,610
You must know I needed to give him a key.

4509
03:13:32,130 --> 03:13:32,950
As if.

4510
03:13:33,110 --> 03:13:36,170
Why would a locksmith be giving away his keys?

4511
03:13:37,890 --> 03:13:41,010
Shadow has been giving away a lot of keys, actually.

4512
03:13:41,410 --> 03:13:43,310
Everyone but us seems to have one.

4513
03:13:44,270 --> 03:13:45,050
That's true.

4514
03:13:45,510 --> 03:13:47,810
Everyone's been able to unlock the next door for us.

4515
03:13:48,530 --> 03:13:49,830
I didn't know that!

4516
03:13:50,190 --> 03:13:51,850
Shadow's been passing out keys?

4517
03:13:52,610 --> 03:13:53,550
How cool!

4518
03:13:53,570 --> 03:13:56,610
I can't believe he's doing his job!

4519
03:13:59,170 --> 03:14:02,930
Perhaps Doki made our FPSV2, but now I can further validate Shadow's claims.

4520
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:03,790
Oh, it's a keyring.

4521
03:14:04,030 --> 03:14:05,370
It's also like the last thing.

4522
03:14:06,050 --> 03:14:07,050
We can do what?

4523
03:14:07,650 --> 03:14:08,990
Doki made our FPSV2.

4524
03:14:09,090 --> 03:14:11,470
What evidence supports Shadow's claim that he was... Oh wait, no.

4525
03:14:11,630 --> 03:14:12,030
Yeah.

4526
03:14:12,210 --> 03:14:13,750
He doesn't have a lot of keys left.

4527
03:14:14,130 --> 03:14:14,990
He just has two.

4528
03:14:16,850 --> 03:14:17,890
He is the key man.

4529
03:14:18,090 --> 03:14:19,890
What else would we be doing with all these keys?

4530
03:14:20,610 --> 03:14:21,550
That feels good.

4531
03:14:21,830 --> 03:14:23,310
Now to get my thoughts in order.

4532
03:14:23,970 --> 03:14:25,150
I think... Oh shit.

4533
03:14:25,230 --> 03:14:25,430
Okay.

4534
03:14:26,170 --> 03:14:26,670
Alright.

4535
03:14:27,130 --> 03:14:27,890
Game break.

4536
03:14:28,450 --> 03:14:30,330
Time to play my video games.

4537
03:14:31,490 --> 03:14:33,250
This is also gonna be... Okay.

4538
03:14:33,310 --> 03:14:34,230
It's gonna be like the blast.

4539
03:14:34,550 --> 03:14:38,490
I think the blast is actually easier than the the little...

4540
03:14:38,490 --> 03:14:40,210
the fire strike.

4541
03:14:40,610 --> 03:14:42,330
Sorry, I got distracted.

4542
03:14:42,930 --> 03:14:43,430
No!

4543
03:14:44,250 --> 03:14:45,550
No, don't...

4544
03:14:45,550 --> 03:14:45,950
No!

4545
03:14:46,050 --> 03:14:46,490
Oh no!

4546
03:14:46,570 --> 03:14:48,210
This is actually the worst I've ever done!

4547
03:14:49,410 --> 03:14:49,910
No!

4548
03:14:50,030 --> 03:14:50,510
Oh okay.

4549
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:51,050
I made it.

4550
03:14:51,050 --> 03:14:51,930
I barely made it.

4551
03:14:51,990 --> 03:14:53,550
I barely made it.

4552
03:14:58,410 --> 03:14:58,930
Okay.

4553
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:00,730
I still got it.

4554
03:15:00,930 --> 03:15:02,110
There's only one reason.

4555
03:15:02,270 --> 03:15:04,170
I have exactly two keys on that key.

4556
03:15:05,070 --> 03:15:07,710
Those were two keys Shadow meant to give Espeon Vector.

4557
03:15:08,850 --> 03:15:09,610
No way!

4558
03:15:10,230 --> 03:15:10,550
Whoa!

4559
03:15:12,010 --> 03:15:13,130
One of his own key.

4560
03:15:13,310 --> 03:15:15,130
Can one of those be for him?

4561
03:15:16,950 --> 03:15:18,910
I have my own key on me.

4562
03:15:20,410 --> 03:15:20,930
Interesting.

4563
03:15:22,170 --> 03:15:23,130
Likely story.

4564
03:15:23,350 --> 03:15:24,430
It's my birthday.

4565
03:15:24,970 --> 03:15:26,930
So let's say Shadow's telling the truth.

4566
03:15:27,030 --> 03:15:27,670
Then what?

4567
03:15:28,470 --> 03:15:28,890
Huh?

4568
03:15:29,390 --> 03:15:37,030
If Shadow didn't murder Sonic and bring him to the dining car, then what possible reason could he have for locking all the doors?

4569
03:15:38,510 --> 03:15:39,110
Hmm...

4570
03:15:39,110 --> 03:15:40,050
She's right.

4571
03:15:40,190 --> 03:15:41,410
Her theory is strong.

4572
03:15:41,630 --> 03:15:44,870
Tails and I certainly haven't presented any possibilities.

4573
03:15:45,510 --> 03:15:50,510
If Shadow really insisted on Sonic's murder, it's cause he didn't buy you a birthday gift.

4574
03:15:50,850 --> 03:15:51,890
He's a leech!

4575
03:15:54,190 --> 03:15:59,230
I think Doki made a FPSB2 and I know exactly why Shadow was locking all that doors.

4576
03:15:59,690 --> 03:16:02,310
Why does he keep including me too?

4577
03:16:02,550 --> 03:16:03,730
I'm just a butler.

4578
03:16:03,810 --> 03:16:05,170
Slash microwave guy.

4579
03:16:06,770 --> 03:16:07,410
Huh?

4580
03:16:07,510 --> 03:16:09,950
Has everyone today given you a birthday present?

4581
03:16:10,130 --> 03:16:10,570
Yeah!

4582
03:16:11,050 --> 03:16:12,150
Yeah Amy!

4583
03:16:12,610 --> 03:16:13,990
Almost everyone.

4584
03:16:14,310 --> 03:16:14,570
Yeah.

4585
03:16:14,950 --> 03:16:16,450
Everyone's been so sweet.

4586
03:16:19,950 --> 03:16:20,510
Everyone...

4587
03:16:22,850 --> 03:16:25,410
He's just forgetful, Doki.

4588
03:16:26,030 --> 03:16:27,810
Hop off my goat!

4589
03:16:28,170 --> 03:16:28,410
He's...

4590
03:16:28,410 --> 03:16:31,530
How dare you say that about my Oshiii!

4591
03:16:33,070 --> 03:16:36,450
Shadow and Sonic haven't given me anything yet, but that's okay.

4592
03:16:36,650 --> 03:16:39,570
Just them being here is an... Oh my god, Amy, you're too nice.

4593
03:16:40,650 --> 03:16:41,210
Understood.

4594
03:16:41,270 --> 03:16:42,250
Thank you, Amy.

4595
03:16:43,130 --> 03:16:44,690
Doki made a FPSB2?

4596
03:16:45,490 --> 03:16:46,730
Uh, yes, Tails?

4597
03:16:47,270 --> 03:16:48,190
I have a theory.

4598
03:16:48,350 --> 03:16:50,290
Find a piece of evidence to support it.

4599
03:16:50,890 --> 03:16:55,350
We know Shadow walked through every train door, locking the exit.

4600
03:16:55,590 --> 03:16:58,290
And he gave everyone stationed in the car a key.

4601
03:16:58,790 --> 03:17:01,370
Except for you, me, and Amy.

4602
03:17:02,890 --> 03:17:03,670
That's right!

4603
03:17:04,110 --> 03:17:08,690
The conductor gave her Amy her birthday key, not Shadow!

4604
03:17:09,350 --> 03:17:13,690
So why would he lock all the doors and not give us a key?

4605
03:17:15,810 --> 03:17:18,130
He wanted to keep us away!

4606
03:17:19,090 --> 03:17:22,530
Was Shadow locking all the doors to keep us away?

4607
03:17:22,850 --> 03:17:24,130
Bum bum bum!

4608
03:17:25,870 --> 03:17:28,050
Not us, Doki made a FPSB2.

4609
03:17:28,250 --> 03:17:30,690
I'm making a leap here, but stick with me.

4610
03:17:31,010 --> 03:17:34,230
I think Shadow was trying to keep Amy away!

4611
03:17:34,710 --> 03:17:36,530
Oh my god, finally!

4612
03:17:36,970 --> 03:17:40,290
We knew this for like 20 minutes ago!

4613
03:17:42,490 --> 03:17:43,770
Holy shit!

4614
03:17:44,950 --> 03:17:50,570
Guys, any time now to solve that mystery about Sonic's death!

4615
03:17:51,590 --> 03:17:52,270
Like...

4616
03:17:56,670 --> 03:17:58,330
Hmm... Excuse me?

4617
03:18:00,370 --> 03:18:01,610
Shadow will never do that!

4618
03:18:01,750 --> 03:18:02,710
It's my birthday!

4619
03:18:03,850 --> 03:18:05,270
You know it's my birthday, right?

4620
03:18:05,450 --> 03:18:06,310
Don't you, Shadow?

4621
03:18:08,010 --> 03:18:08,690
Hmm...

4622
03:18:08,690 --> 03:18:12,990
How dare Doki made a FPSB2!

4623
03:18:13,310 --> 03:18:14,470
Show me evidence!

4624
03:18:15,470 --> 03:18:16,150
Huh?

4625
03:18:16,650 --> 03:18:18,070
Is Shadow trying to keep me away?

4626
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:18,730
Prove it!

4627
03:18:18,830 --> 03:18:20,150
You've been so thorough or whatever!

4628
03:18:20,670 --> 03:18:21,890
What proof do you have?

4629
03:18:22,910 --> 03:18:23,610
Uh, okay!

4630
03:18:24,310 --> 03:18:27,130
Tell us if Shadow was trying to keep just Amy away?

4631
03:18:27,390 --> 03:18:27,910
Why?

4632
03:18:28,150 --> 03:18:30,810
What if it shows what Shadow didn't want Amy to know?

4633
03:18:30,870 --> 03:18:35,470
That he fucking bought this her birthday gift last minute on the fucking train!

4634
03:18:36,570 --> 03:18:37,650
That feels right.

4635
03:18:37,910 --> 03:18:39,410
Alright, gaming time!

4636
03:18:40,270 --> 03:18:42,190
I hope this is the last one!

4637
03:18:42,450 --> 03:18:42,950
Hahaha!

4638
03:18:42,950 --> 03:18:43,190
Hahaha!

4639
03:18:45,090 --> 03:18:45,650
Woooo!

4640
03:18:46,510 --> 03:18:47,070
Woooo!

4641
03:18:48,170 --> 03:18:52,130
Guys, all I'm saying is I have never lost a single one.

4642
03:18:52,590 --> 03:18:57,650
It doesn't matter if like I was like one ring away from losing.

4643
03:18:57,830 --> 03:18:59,790
I still haven't lost though.

4644
03:18:59,870 --> 03:19:01,010
That doesn't mean I lost.

4645
03:19:01,430 --> 03:19:01,990
Chat.

4646
03:19:02,510 --> 03:19:04,290
That doesn't mean I lost.

4647
03:19:04,390 --> 03:19:06,170
It just meant I did it.

4648
03:19:06,410 --> 03:19:07,070
There you go.

4649
03:19:07,090 --> 03:19:07,170
Woo!

4650
03:19:07,330 --> 03:19:07,670
Woo!

4651
03:19:07,790 --> 03:19:08,030
Woo!

4652
03:19:08,090 --> 03:19:09,910
This has to be endgame.

4653
03:19:10,110 --> 03:19:12,790
Look at all the fucking blasts!

4654
03:19:16,900 --> 03:19:17,200
What?

4655
03:19:17,540 --> 03:19:18,020
What?

4656
03:19:18,020 --> 03:19:19,400
Reading through the trash?

4657
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:21,840
What the fuck is wrong with you?

4658
03:19:22,160 --> 03:19:23,320
What is that?

4659
03:19:23,700 --> 03:19:26,520
We found this in the trash bin next to the printer!

4660
03:19:28,060 --> 03:19:28,920
Hot Honey!

4661
03:19:29,280 --> 03:19:31,520
It's a banned ticket website.

4662
03:19:32,920 --> 03:19:34,120
Tails, don't!

4663
03:19:35,260 --> 03:19:37,280
This is Hot Honey's website!

4664
03:19:37,580 --> 03:19:38,560
No way!

4665
03:19:41,230 --> 03:19:42,270
Hot Honey!

4666
03:19:42,350 --> 03:19:43,470
Oh no, they used Ticketmaster.

4667
03:19:43,930 --> 03:19:44,530
No!

4668
03:19:45,210 --> 03:19:48,250
Shadow, you're gonna get scammed with all the fees!

4669
03:19:48,410 --> 03:19:48,930
Shadow!

4670
03:19:49,570 --> 03:19:50,470
Shadow, no!

4671
03:19:51,610 --> 03:19:53,930
Don't fucking fall for Ticketmaster!

4672
03:19:57,090 --> 03:19:59,310
It's the band I'm currently obsessed with.

4673
03:19:59,490 --> 03:20:02,330
Jereme B is my current favorite.

4674
03:20:05,530 --> 03:20:08,090
All the members have B after their name.

4675
03:20:10,870 --> 03:20:11,670
Isn't it cute?

4676
03:20:11,830 --> 03:20:14,190
I haven't gone to any other shows yet to see them though.

4677
03:20:14,670 --> 03:20:16,850
Their tickets are really hard to get.

4678
03:20:16,930 --> 03:20:20,730
You have to be really online at a specific time.

4679
03:20:20,910 --> 03:20:23,230
And they sell out- they don't need a sponsorship.

4680
03:20:23,610 --> 03:20:27,370
They're literally having Monopoly on fucking concert tickets.

4681
03:20:27,490 --> 03:20:28,290
Like, what do you mean?

4682
03:20:28,610 --> 03:20:29,090
Like...

4683
03:20:30,050 --> 03:20:36,970
They don't- they don't need it because they're literally the only place you can grab tickets unless you wanna buy scalpers.

4684
03:20:37,170 --> 03:20:39,090
But even then, they're still fucking fees!

4685
03:20:39,330 --> 03:20:40,250
Okay, anyway.

4686
03:20:40,470 --> 03:20:41,950
They sell out every minute.

4687
03:20:43,070 --> 03:20:48,270
So the question becomes, why was this paper found in the train car Shadow was stationed in?

4688
03:20:50,150 --> 03:20:51,570
Watch yourself, Fox.

4689
03:20:52,530 --> 03:20:54,230
The situation is becoming much clearer.

4690
03:20:55,190 --> 03:20:57,510
I don't know how Tails figured things out so soon.

4691
03:20:57,650 --> 03:20:58,610
But I see where he's heading.

4692
03:20:58,930 --> 03:21:00,990
Bro, he's just playing the video game faster than me.

4693
03:21:01,990 --> 03:21:05,430
The printout of the hot Honey Band tickets website exists because...

4694
03:21:06,030 --> 03:21:08,170
I don't know, fucking he was trying to buy tickets?

4695
03:21:08,350 --> 03:21:10,470
Like, what- where else would this go to?

4696
03:21:14,190 --> 03:21:16,990
Shadow's also a big hot- okay, yeah, that's another choice.

4697
03:21:19,790 --> 03:21:20,350
Well, oi!

4698
03:21:20,630 --> 03:21:21,790
Shadow, is this true?

4699
03:21:22,590 --> 03:21:25,490
Are you trying to get more concert tickets for my birthday?

4700
03:21:27,310 --> 03:21:27,710
Hmm...

4701
03:21:28,510 --> 03:21:30,970
I done a poor job hiding the surprise, it seems.

4702
03:21:31,350 --> 03:21:32,130
Well, did you get it?

4703
03:21:32,370 --> 03:21:34,830
Yes, I'm trying to get you concert tickets for your birthday.

4704
03:21:36,550 --> 03:21:36,950
Hmm...

4705
03:21:37,690 --> 03:21:38,090
Shadow!

4706
03:21:38,090 --> 03:21:38,370
Shadow!

4707
03:21:38,390 --> 03:21:39,870
She didn't even do it!

4708
03:21:40,390 --> 03:21:40,910
Like...

4709
03:21:41,890 --> 03:21:44,530
Like, he didn't even do it though!

4710
03:21:44,790 --> 03:21:45,530
He couldn't!

4711
03:21:46,210 --> 03:21:49,210
I used that printer earlier and I found it difficult to manage.

4712
03:21:49,450 --> 03:21:52,970
When logging onto the website, did you print the homepage by accident?

4713
03:21:53,550 --> 03:21:55,310
Uh, Jesus, thank you for the super chat.

4714
03:21:55,410 --> 03:21:56,170
Thank you, thank you.

4715
03:21:57,310 --> 03:21:59,070
Yes, that's exactly what happened.

4716
03:21:59,510 --> 03:22:02,050
I'm not fantastic with computers, admittedly.

4717
03:22:02,590 --> 03:22:04,730
Wait, the ultimate life form is not a gamer?

4718
03:22:06,770 --> 03:22:07,290
What?

4719
03:22:07,290 --> 03:22:08,810
He doesn't represent the people?

4720
03:22:09,190 --> 03:22:09,750
What?

4721
03:22:11,530 --> 03:22:12,090
But...

4722
03:22:12,090 --> 03:22:16,330
I thought... I thought you were supposed to be the gamer edgelord.

4723
03:22:17,130 --> 03:22:17,690
Nooooo!

4724
03:22:22,190 --> 03:22:23,490
I can't believe this.

4725
03:22:23,630 --> 03:22:25,130
After I accused you of murder!

4726
03:22:27,170 --> 03:22:28,450
Spill everything, Shadow!

4727
03:22:28,670 --> 03:22:30,050
The cat's out of the bag!

4728
03:22:30,270 --> 03:22:32,050
I wanna know everything!

4729
03:22:32,570 --> 03:22:34,150
He didn't get the tickets in me.

4730
03:22:34,350 --> 03:22:35,590
Like, fine.

4731
03:22:35,750 --> 03:22:37,190
The surprise is ruined anyway.

4732
03:22:38,530 --> 03:22:39,990
Probably our fault there.

4733
03:22:40,630 --> 03:22:43,610
Sorry, that's all the detective's job, I suppose.

4734
03:22:44,230 --> 03:22:48,090
When I arrived on the train, I realized everyone else had a gift except for me.

4735
03:22:48,930 --> 03:22:54,570
Worried for my social status, I immediately began brainstorming my ideas and saw the computer.

4736
03:22:55,370 --> 03:22:59,050
I remember Amy had never seen Hot Honey live and looked it up.

4737
03:22:59,170 --> 03:23:00,910
That's when I accidentally printed the homepage.

4738
03:23:01,490 --> 03:23:05,410
The concert tickets weren't actually on sale, I realized, but would be available soon.

4739
03:23:06,350 --> 03:23:08,570
Is that the appointment you keep speaking of?

4740
03:23:08,710 --> 03:23:11,150
The time you're able to actually buy the concert tickets?

4741
03:23:12,410 --> 03:23:12,770
Precisely.

4742
03:23:12,950 --> 03:23:14,350
I haven't purchased... Yeah, I know!

4743
03:23:14,430 --> 03:23:15,050
I told you!

4744
03:23:16,430 --> 03:23:16,790
Bro!

4745
03:23:16,790 --> 03:23:23,070
Okay, I literally, if they let me talk, I would have fucking... this murder party would be done in an hour.

4746
03:23:24,570 --> 03:23:27,190
And you had to keep Amy away while I waited to buy the tickets.

4747
03:23:27,370 --> 03:23:28,850
So I began locking all the doors.

4748
03:23:29,490 --> 03:23:33,290
But for the safety of everyone, I handed out keys so they could get in and out.

4749
03:23:33,290 --> 03:23:35,230
Telled them not to let anyone through.

4750
03:23:36,490 --> 03:23:38,590
He's worried of his social status.

4751
03:23:39,610 --> 03:23:44,090
Like, look, it took him a lot of years to craft this social status.

4752
03:23:45,890 --> 03:23:46,850
It didn't work.

4753
03:23:47,090 --> 03:23:48,850
Amy still managed to make it here somehow.

4754
03:23:49,650 --> 03:23:51,750
It's because the conductor gave me this.

4755
03:23:53,530 --> 03:23:54,130
Yeah!

4756
03:23:54,130 --> 03:23:56,890
This key opens up any door on the train.

4757
03:23:57,410 --> 03:24:00,090
I've gone through every locked door with ease.

4758
03:24:02,110 --> 03:24:03,990
The plans fade of law.

4759
03:24:05,450 --> 03:24:06,250
Journalist mode.

4760
03:24:07,550 --> 03:24:08,570
I should have guessed.

4761
03:24:08,850 --> 03:24:10,270
It's a well-known privilege.

4762
03:24:11,370 --> 03:24:12,410
Shadow, hi.

4763
03:24:12,550 --> 03:24:14,350
Your gesture is so sweet.

4764
03:24:14,530 --> 03:24:16,390
And after I accused you too.

4765
03:24:17,130 --> 03:24:18,210
How about this?

4766
03:24:18,350 --> 03:24:22,950
Let's buy the tickets later and to make it up to you, you can come with...

4767
03:24:22,950 --> 03:24:24,510
Wait, bro, it's... what?

4768
03:24:25,770 --> 03:24:28,210
Why would she make it up for her?

4769
03:24:28,490 --> 03:24:29,410
Like for Shadow?

4770
03:24:30,210 --> 03:24:31,370
It's her birthday.

4771
03:24:31,590 --> 03:24:34,730
She's the one that didn't even get the birthday present.

4772
03:24:35,510 --> 03:24:36,070
What?

4773
03:24:41,110 --> 03:24:42,590
I don't understand.

4774
03:24:43,130 --> 03:24:43,810
Like, why?

4775
03:24:44,170 --> 03:24:45,970
He's the one that fucked up.

4776
03:24:46,970 --> 03:24:48,870
I don't know if...

4777
03:24:49,650 --> 03:24:50,470
Too late.

4778
03:24:50,550 --> 03:24:51,010
It's happening.

4779
03:24:51,250 --> 03:24:52,470
I can't wait.

4780
03:24:52,650 --> 03:24:53,690
A show of a lifetime.

4781
03:24:54,870 --> 03:24:55,430
Fine.

4782
03:24:55,870 --> 03:24:58,670
It's like she's paying for her own fucking tickets.

4783
03:24:59,190 --> 03:25:00,430
Happy birthday, Amy.

4784
03:25:00,510 --> 03:25:01,710
Thanks for buying my tickets.

4785
03:25:04,450 --> 03:25:07,250
I expect lots of pictures from the concert, you two.

4786
03:25:09,250 --> 03:25:12,570
Seems that Mr. Shadow's locked door has finally reached the end.

4787
03:25:15,270 --> 03:25:18,030
I blame my source for all of this.

4788
03:25:18,230 --> 03:25:19,550
That wasn't a hot tip at all.

4789
03:25:19,670 --> 03:25:22,070
They need me to believe Shadow was behind everything?

4790
03:25:22,790 --> 03:25:25,770
My credibility as a journalist reported down the drain.

4791
03:25:27,190 --> 03:25:28,030
I'm curious.

4792
03:25:28,410 --> 03:25:30,450
Who is this source of your big scoop?

4793
03:25:31,430 --> 03:25:32,670
I'd like to know as well.

4794
03:25:33,710 --> 03:25:34,230
Sorry.

4795
03:25:34,490 --> 03:25:35,410
Strictly confidential.

4796
03:25:35,890 --> 03:25:36,830
Trust me, bro.

4797
03:25:37,790 --> 03:25:42,670
My credibility may be shot, but my principle must stay intact.

4798
03:25:44,530 --> 03:25:47,350
I have a strong feeling I know who exactly is your source.

4799
03:25:47,430 --> 03:25:47,910
Is it Sonic?

4800
03:25:49,270 --> 03:25:49,790
Huh?

4801
03:25:49,790 --> 03:25:52,250
But we need to investigate one last area.

4802
03:25:52,530 --> 03:25:54,510
The conductor's car.

4803
03:25:54,690 --> 03:25:55,350
Oh, is it the conductor?

4804
03:25:56,110 --> 03:25:57,210
I'll come with you.

4805
03:25:57,290 --> 03:26:00,550
I'd love to know who's been dragging my name throughout the mud.

4806
03:26:01,630 --> 03:26:02,850
I'll join you as well.

4807
03:26:03,690 --> 03:26:05,310
I'll see you through the end.

4808
03:26:06,110 --> 03:26:07,750
We're more than happy to have you both.

4809
03:26:08,710 --> 03:26:10,290
Doki made our FPSV tube.

4810
03:26:10,510 --> 03:26:14,190
I had to say it, but I believe our investigation finally is coming to a close.

4811
03:26:14,270 --> 03:26:15,690
Oh my god, we're gonna figure it out!

4812
03:26:16,150 --> 03:26:16,930
It's being clear.

4813
03:26:17,190 --> 03:26:17,990
Has it really?

4814
03:26:18,190 --> 03:26:20,150
I honestly think Sonic's in a coma.

4815
03:26:20,750 --> 03:26:23,850
Not like actual coma, but in a food coma from all the chili dogs.

4816
03:26:25,490 --> 03:26:27,450
We'll pin down Sonic's murder for good!

4817
03:26:28,330 --> 03:26:29,230
Right on then.

4818
03:26:29,950 --> 03:26:30,710
Let's do it!

4819
03:26:31,910 --> 03:26:32,890
Alright, nice.

4820
03:26:34,230 --> 03:26:35,050
Anything else?

4821
03:26:35,250 --> 03:26:35,550
Okay.

4822
03:26:37,210 --> 03:26:38,150
Let's finish this.

4823
03:26:38,630 --> 03:26:40,230
It's now or never!

4824
03:26:46,270 --> 03:26:47,570
The conductor's car.

4825
03:26:50,650 --> 03:26:52,610
Truly surround my evidence before I continue.

4826
03:26:52,930 --> 03:26:56,650
In my short time working on this train, I haven't visited a conductor's car yet.

4827
03:26:57,510 --> 03:26:58,010
Feels...

4828
03:26:58,570 --> 03:26:58,830
empty?

4829
03:26:59,270 --> 03:26:59,990
Yeah, where's the conductor?

4830
03:27:00,330 --> 03:27:00,950
Wait, where's- Yeah!

4831
03:27:01,050 --> 03:27:01,610
Where's the conductor?

4832
03:27:02,370 --> 03:27:03,050
That's odd.

4833
03:27:03,250 --> 03:27:04,810
I haven't seen him throughout the train at all.

4834
03:27:05,470 --> 03:27:08,270
As fast as we saw him, we saw him when he left the dining car.

4835
03:27:09,130 --> 03:27:10,750
Something clearly happened here.

4836
03:27:11,570 --> 03:27:13,530
Nothing we can't figure out, teehee!

4837
03:27:14,170 --> 03:27:14,870
Come on!

4838
03:27:15,030 --> 03:27:15,930
Time to investigate!

4839
03:27:16,450 --> 03:27:16,750
Whoa.

4840
03:27:17,530 --> 03:27:19,070
Obviously, the spilled cup.

4841
03:27:19,410 --> 03:27:21,570
Did this fall over when the train sped up?

4842
03:27:21,690 --> 03:27:23,350
Did he have a heart attack?!

4843
03:27:24,610 --> 03:27:25,290
Not sure.

4844
03:27:25,470 --> 03:27:27,210
Wait, what's it say on the mug?

4845
03:27:27,850 --> 03:27:32,170
A cup of joe in your hand, wife by your side, paradise.

4846
03:27:33,590 --> 03:27:34,330
Alright, alright.

4847
03:27:34,590 --> 03:27:35,310
We get it.

4848
03:27:35,350 --> 03:27:36,130
He loves his wife.

4849
03:27:36,570 --> 03:27:37,010
Which wife?

4850
03:27:37,790 --> 03:27:38,270
Okay.

4851
03:27:38,350 --> 03:27:39,050
Not that.

4852
03:27:39,270 --> 03:27:40,310
Oh, the arms!

4853
03:27:40,670 --> 03:27:42,030
When the arms broken!

4854
03:27:42,230 --> 03:27:43,010
Wait, what's this?

4855
03:27:43,750 --> 03:27:44,390
What's this?

4856
03:27:44,470 --> 03:27:45,430
Was someone playing darts?

4857
03:27:47,650 --> 03:27:48,690
That's not a throwing dart.

4858
03:27:49,070 --> 03:27:51,030
That's a blow- Wait!

4859
03:27:51,590 --> 03:27:54,030
It wasn't a food coma?!

4860
03:27:54,710 --> 03:27:55,770
That's a blow dart.

4861
03:27:57,090 --> 03:27:59,170
Someone brought this weapon onto the train.

4862
03:28:00,910 --> 03:28:02,290
That shouldn't be possible.

4863
03:28:02,470 --> 03:28:04,830
How did he bring the- How did he bring it?

4864
03:28:04,930 --> 03:28:05,730
How did he bring it?

4865
03:28:08,240 --> 03:28:09,020
Tails is right.

4866
03:28:10,740 --> 03:28:14,620
Tails, the train detects any weapons on a passenger train before letting them abroad.

4867
03:28:16,200 --> 03:28:17,300
Let's make note of this.

4868
03:28:17,660 --> 03:28:19,140
Blow darts add in your inventory.

4869
03:28:19,380 --> 03:28:21,300
Okay, there's no way there's anything else in the trash.

4870
03:28:21,620 --> 03:28:22,740
I don't need- Yeah, see?

4871
03:28:23,020 --> 03:28:25,200
You're satisfied with finding clues here before, huh?

4872
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:28,200
I know they say always check the trash bin, but I'm good.

4873
03:28:28,300 --> 03:28:29,780
I'll go on a high note.

4874
03:28:29,920 --> 03:28:32,140
See, I told you there's nothing in that trash bin!

4875
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,460
This robot has been completely torn off.

4876
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:40,180
Ugh, how creepy.

4877
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:42,100
That arm is powerful.

4878
03:28:42,800 --> 03:28:44,620
It'd be tough to break out its grip.

4879
03:28:45,560 --> 03:28:47,680
A lot of people here have strength to tear this off.

4880
03:28:47,840 --> 03:28:48,800
But the question is why?

4881
03:28:49,540 --> 03:28:52,940
A confrontation definitely occurred in this room!

4882
03:28:53,160 --> 03:28:54,380
We should log this!

4883
03:28:54,940 --> 03:28:55,920
Aye aye, sir.

4884
03:28:56,860 --> 03:28:58,120
Broken robot arm.

4885
03:28:58,500 --> 03:28:59,800
Yeah, I think we have enough clues.

4886
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:02,020
Okay.

4887
03:29:02,300 --> 03:29:02,820
Amy!

4888
03:29:03,100 --> 03:29:04,780
I have the clues ready!

4889
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:06,940
I'm ready to- Oh, hey.

4890
03:29:07,940 --> 03:29:08,340
Oh.

4891
03:29:08,780 --> 03:29:09,400
I'm gonna skip.

4892
03:29:09,520 --> 03:29:11,800
Oh, next being for nasal medication was the- What?

4893
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:13,200
Oh, the next ad.

4894
03:29:13,280 --> 03:29:13,980
I shouldn't have skipped that.

4895
03:29:14,120 --> 03:29:15,060
Okay, I was like, huh?

4896
03:29:15,340 --> 03:29:16,540
Perhaps too much detail.

4897
03:29:17,480 --> 03:29:18,780
Oh my god, there's him!

4898
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:19,660
Look at him!

4899
03:29:19,800 --> 03:29:20,740
He looks so young!

4900
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:23,320
Look at this doggo.

4901
03:29:23,680 --> 03:29:24,320
Alright, Amy.

4902
03:29:24,440 --> 03:29:25,780
I'm ready to solve the case!

4903
03:29:26,640 --> 03:29:29,300
It's been- You know this game is supposed to be two hours max?

4904
03:29:30,180 --> 03:29:30,580
Yeah.

4905
03:29:30,580 --> 03:29:30,680
Yeah.

4906
03:29:36,160 --> 03:29:40,380
Think you have enough evidence for me to call everyone here?

4907
03:29:44,420 --> 03:29:45,520
What do you think?

4908
03:29:46,220 --> 03:29:47,920
Jokey made of FPSV tube.

4909
03:29:48,140 --> 03:29:49,440
Ready to solve this case?

4910
03:29:50,960 --> 03:29:51,600
Yes!

4911
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:52,760
Hello everyone!

4912
03:29:53,020 --> 03:29:55,200
This is the birthday girl speaking!

4913
03:29:59,310 --> 03:30:01,210
Please report to the conductor car.

4914
03:30:02,110 --> 03:30:02,590
At once!

4915
03:30:07,870 --> 03:30:09,110
This is it!

4916
03:30:09,730 --> 03:30:10,590
Hello everybody.

4917
03:30:11,190 --> 03:30:12,970
Sonic's not here cause he's fucking dead.

4918
03:30:15,650 --> 03:30:16,890
Wonderful to have you all here.

4919
03:30:17,250 --> 03:30:19,830
Tails and I are ready to announce our primes!

4920
03:30:19,910 --> 03:30:20,270
I am?

4921
03:30:20,510 --> 03:30:20,810
Okay.

4922
03:30:21,130 --> 03:30:22,490
Oh, I'm- I don't need to do it.

4923
03:30:22,590 --> 03:30:23,130
Oh, okay.

4924
03:30:23,210 --> 03:30:23,530
I do.

4925
03:30:23,670 --> 03:30:26,450
With assistance from Jokey made of FPSV tube!

4926
03:30:27,450 --> 03:30:29,230
Why hasn't Sonic showed up?

4927
03:30:29,950 --> 03:30:30,430
Huh?

4928
03:30:33,610 --> 03:30:34,130
Sonic?

4929
03:30:34,870 --> 03:30:35,390
Vector!

4930
03:30:36,850 --> 03:30:38,730
Real quick, can you come with me to get Sonic?

4931
03:30:39,470 --> 03:30:42,350
He must still be pretending to be dead, lazy bum.

4932
03:30:43,250 --> 03:30:44,870
Ready, let's go get him!

4933
03:30:45,610 --> 03:30:46,810
Alright, let's get him to wrap Sonic.

4934
03:30:47,610 --> 03:30:51,490
Let me tell you darlings, this has been a delight.

4935
03:30:53,130 --> 03:30:54,010
A delight?

4936
03:30:55,050 --> 03:30:57,250
The air in here is so intense.

4937
03:30:58,170 --> 03:30:59,290
I love it.

4938
03:30:59,430 --> 03:31:00,130
I-I don't know.

4939
03:31:00,310 --> 03:31:02,670
My voice for Rouge keep- fucking changing.

4940
03:31:03,700 --> 03:31:06,070
Nothing like the thrill of mystery.

4941
03:31:08,310 --> 03:31:10,690
The train has so many amenities.

4942
03:31:11,290 --> 03:31:13,350
I feel so catered to.

4943
03:31:15,270 --> 03:31:17,670
Admittedly, I've been having a lot of fun myself.

4944
03:31:17,930 --> 03:31:20,010
The amusement of a chase.

4945
03:31:21,230 --> 03:31:25,330
I see why you're a detective outside of this mystery SPL.

4946
03:31:25,610 --> 03:31:26,730
Wait, he's a detective?

4947
03:31:27,010 --> 03:31:27,890
I thought he was a ninja.

4948
03:31:28,510 --> 03:31:31,210
Yeah, and I love a good thrill it seems.

4949
03:31:31,490 --> 03:31:32,610
I thought he was a ninja!

4950
03:31:33,130 --> 03:31:37,190
But on this train, I am but a humble po- Is he a ninja detective?

4951
03:31:39,610 --> 03:31:42,390
I'd be willing to be- do an event like this again.

4952
03:31:42,750 --> 03:31:45,430
It says here the train does escape rooms as well.

4953
03:31:46,090 --> 03:31:47,530
He's a detective ninja?

4954
03:31:48,070 --> 03:31:49,610
Bro, he can do anything!

4955
03:31:50,150 --> 03:31:51,010
Fucking nerd.

4956
03:31:51,850 --> 03:31:54,250
I love escape- I fucking hate escape.

4957
03:31:55,490 --> 03:31:56,770
Count me in!

4958
03:31:57,950 --> 03:32:00,150
I'm so glad everyone's having a good time.

4959
03:32:01,210 --> 03:32:06,690
Maybe we could get rid of a train just to relax- Oh wait, maybe we could- sorry, I was like get rid of a train.

4960
03:32:06,810 --> 03:32:09,950
Maybe we can ride a train just to relax some time.

4961
03:32:10,990 --> 03:32:12,430
Yeah, that'd be fun too.

4962
03:32:15,130 --> 03:32:15,590
AHHHHHHHHH!

4963
03:32:17,390 --> 03:32:17,850
Whoa!

4964
03:32:18,650 --> 03:32:19,110
Huh?

4965
03:32:20,010 --> 03:32:21,070
What in the world?

4966
03:32:21,450 --> 03:32:23,350
Oh, okay, wait, that's- What in the world?

4967
03:32:24,330 --> 03:32:25,490
That's Amy's voice!

4968
03:32:26,770 --> 03:32:26,890
Quick!

4969
03:32:27,130 --> 03:32:28,850
Oh wait, quick, where's Amy?

4970
03:32:32,430 --> 03:32:33,870
Oh my god!

4971
03:32:34,410 --> 03:32:35,490
He's dead!

4972
03:32:37,270 --> 03:32:39,050
He's not responding to us!

4973
03:32:39,650 --> 03:32:40,250
Sonic!

4974
03:32:40,490 --> 03:32:41,090
SONIC!

4975
03:32:42,530 --> 03:32:43,750
Is he hurt?

4976
03:32:44,930 --> 03:32:47,630
Guys, trust me, I checked his pulse, he's definitely dead.

4977
03:32:50,070 --> 03:32:50,370
Um...

4978
03:32:51,210 --> 03:32:52,590
Is he hurt?

4979
03:32:54,610 --> 03:32:56,310
Why isn't he moving?

4980
03:32:57,290 --> 03:32:59,910
Sonic, Sonic, can you hear us?

4981
03:33:01,190 --> 03:33:02,330
He's banged up.

4982
03:33:02,410 --> 03:33:04,350
If there's a pulse, it's weak.

4983
03:33:04,650 --> 03:33:06,030
Oh my god, he actually has a pulse?

4984
03:33:06,130 --> 03:33:06,790
No fucking way!

4985
03:33:08,150 --> 03:33:09,490
Set him down.

4986
03:33:09,770 --> 03:33:12,430
Make sure his head is propped up.

4987
03:33:13,530 --> 03:33:14,570
I'll help you.

4988
03:33:15,550 --> 03:33:16,070
I'll help you.

4989
03:33:16,110 --> 03:33:16,630
Hmm...

4990
03:33:17,590 --> 03:33:19,770
I knew one of you would take this too far.

4991
03:33:21,530 --> 03:33:23,610
Which one of you did this to Sonic?

4992
03:33:23,710 --> 03:33:25,610
On my birthday, no less!

4993
03:33:25,610 --> 03:33:25,890
Yes!

4994
03:33:27,370 --> 03:33:28,850
Could this have been one of us?

4995
03:33:29,090 --> 03:33:30,310
Sorry, I'm like, yee-haw.

4996
03:33:31,150 --> 03:33:33,630
Y'all, could this have been one of us?

4997
03:33:37,070 --> 03:33:39,330
There's no one else here, Knuckles!

4998
03:33:40,430 --> 03:33:41,450
So I'll ask again.

4999
03:33:42,030 --> 03:33:43,670
Which one of you did this?

5000
03:33:44,030 --> 03:33:44,910
Is this a conductor?

5001
03:33:46,330 --> 03:33:46,810
Eggman!

5002
03:33:47,730 --> 03:33:48,970
Surprise, Eggman!

5003
03:33:50,070 --> 03:33:51,250
I can't believe it.

5004
03:33:51,270 --> 03:33:52,310
It was not a food coma.

5005
03:33:54,510 --> 03:33:55,250
This is...

5006
03:33:55,610 --> 03:33:56,110
inexcusable.

5007
03:33:56,290 --> 03:33:56,950
Sonic's hurt.

5008
03:33:57,690 --> 03:33:59,890
I'm going to expose the monster who did this.

5009
03:34:01,850 --> 03:34:03,370
Tails is not having it.

5010
03:34:03,550 --> 03:34:05,870
I thought Sonic could handle anything, but...

5011
03:34:05,870 --> 03:34:07,730
somehow he met his match.

5012
03:34:08,990 --> 03:34:09,950
Who murdered...

5013
03:34:11,050 --> 03:34:12,230
Who murdered Sonic?

5014
03:34:13,190 --> 03:34:15,110
I'm going to help you get the bottom of this...

5015
03:34:15,110 --> 03:34:17,490
I'm going to help you get the bottom of this, Tails.

5016
03:34:18,970 --> 03:34:19,450
Absolutely!

5017
03:34:20,450 --> 03:34:22,050
Me too, y'all.

5018
03:34:23,110 --> 03:34:23,590
Same.

5019
03:34:24,450 --> 03:34:25,590
We're going to figure out something.

5020
03:34:25,610 --> 03:34:26,850
We're going to figure out exactly what happened in this room.

5021
03:34:27,310 --> 03:34:29,050
And punish the one responsible.

5022
03:34:30,590 --> 03:34:32,770
San Diego, thank you for the Akasuba!

5023
03:34:33,130 --> 03:34:34,010
Thank you, thank you!

5024
03:34:34,090 --> 03:34:34,750
Don't kill her.

5025
03:34:35,690 --> 03:34:36,470
Don't kill her.

5026
03:34:36,550 --> 03:34:37,050
I'm not the killer.

5027
03:34:38,470 --> 03:34:38,950
Sonic!

5028
03:34:40,710 --> 03:34:41,870
I'm writing my wrong.

5029
03:34:41,970 --> 03:34:43,090
I must take down the murderer.

5030
03:34:45,470 --> 03:34:45,950
Tails.

5031
03:34:46,110 --> 03:34:47,830
No key made out FPSV tube.

5032
03:34:48,090 --> 03:34:49,470
I have a big question to ask.

5033
03:34:49,910 --> 03:34:51,250
Who in this room did this?

5034
03:34:51,430 --> 03:34:53,870
Who killed Sonic the Hedgehog?

5035
03:34:57,840 --> 03:34:58,500
Wait.

5036
03:34:58,660 --> 03:34:59,060
What?

5037
03:35:03,850 --> 03:35:04,510
Amy!

5038
03:35:05,790 --> 03:35:06,910
That can't be right.

5039
03:35:07,110 --> 03:35:08,930
I can be the murderer.

5040
03:35:09,370 --> 03:35:10,050
That's right.

5041
03:35:10,130 --> 03:35:10,470
Wait.

5042
03:35:10,610 --> 03:35:11,610
It's actually not Amy?

5043
03:35:18,010 --> 03:35:20,450
It's actually not Amy?

5044
03:35:21,650 --> 03:35:22,950
Oh my God.

5045
03:35:26,090 --> 03:35:28,270
Maybe it's, It's the ninja detective.

5046
03:35:28,430 --> 03:35:30,690
Wait, it's the ninja detective because he was gone!

5047
03:35:51,810 --> 03:35:54,350
You're accusing Espio?

5048
03:35:57,570 --> 03:35:58,310
You have nothing!

5049
03:36:25,490 --> 03:36:27,250
Vector's been active.

5050
03:36:27,570 --> 03:36:30,230
We discovered a hidden passage!

5051
03:36:32,370 --> 03:36:37,330
Espio could lock the library at any time because Tails and I find a hidden passage!

5052
03:36:37,810 --> 03:36:38,290
Bum bum bum!

5053
03:36:39,470 --> 03:36:41,210
Speedrun to the lounge car!

5054
03:36:41,590 --> 03:36:42,210
Bum bum bum!

5055
03:36:43,390 --> 03:36:46,390
In the lounge, the hidden passage exits behind the wardrobe.

5056
03:36:46,690 --> 03:36:48,750
I feel lucky we even found it.

5057
03:36:49,110 --> 03:36:52,350
Not only would Espio avoid any locked doors...

5058
03:36:52,350 --> 03:36:54,070
Vector is his boyfriend.

5059
03:36:55,450 --> 03:36:57,190
But that would put him in the car.

5060
03:36:57,570 --> 03:36:59,130
But just before this one...

5061
03:36:59,130 --> 03:37:02,350
You have no evidence I used any secret passage.

5062
03:37:03,110 --> 03:37:04,010
I answered...

5063
03:37:04,010 --> 03:37:05,790
Oh, the blue dirt because he's a ninja!

5064
03:37:07,170 --> 03:37:08,610
I was reading the entire time.

5065
03:37:08,670 --> 03:37:09,430
Remember, it's true.

5066
03:37:09,470 --> 03:37:10,310
You didn't miss a question.

5067
03:37:10,690 --> 03:37:14,190
I think Doki made an FPS VTuber and I can explain that too.

5068
03:37:14,350 --> 03:37:15,730
Doki made an FPS VTube.

5069
03:37:16,290 --> 03:37:19,190
How did Espio know everything in the train manual he was reading?

5070
03:37:21,250 --> 03:37:22,350
Bro, I don't know.

5071
03:37:22,590 --> 03:37:22,970
Hahaha!

5072
03:37:26,860 --> 03:37:28,220
A ninja like him!

5073
03:37:28,440 --> 03:37:28,920
Speedrun!

5074
03:37:28,920 --> 03:37:29,840
Speedreads!

5075
03:37:29,860 --> 03:37:33,480
I don't know anything about lit ninjas, but I assume that's true.

5076
03:37:34,600 --> 03:37:38,140
He's fluent in 17 different languages.

5077
03:37:38,620 --> 03:37:40,600
And bro, what the fuck?

5078
03:37:40,680 --> 03:37:42,580
How much perfect can you be?

5079
03:37:42,840 --> 03:37:45,100
Not perfect enough because you got caught, bitch.

5080
03:37:45,420 --> 03:37:46,200
By a tomato.

5081
03:37:46,660 --> 03:37:48,240
What are you getting at?

5082
03:37:49,220 --> 03:37:53,320
You picked a random book from the shelf and met...

5083
03:37:53,320 --> 03:37:55,440
What the fuck is wrong with you, Espio?

5084
03:37:55,920 --> 03:37:57,820
That's way too much work.

5085
03:37:57,900 --> 03:37:58,900
Just normal ninjas.

5086
03:37:58,920 --> 03:37:59,280
Just normal ninja stuff.

5087
03:37:59,340 --> 03:38:01,360
Just normal ninja stuff.

5088
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:05,320
Just to guarantee yourself a clean alibi.

5089
03:38:06,240 --> 03:38:06,960
What?

5090
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:09,160
That's absurd.

5091
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:11,060
Memorizing a whole book?

5092
03:38:11,520 --> 03:38:15,780
I know this is a talented bunch, but that seems like a lie.

5093
03:38:17,020 --> 03:38:17,880
I know this is a talented bunch, but that seems like a lie.

5094
03:38:17,880 --> 03:38:18,160
I don't know.

5095
03:38:18,280 --> 03:38:19,860
It is seen as plausible.

5096
03:38:20,740 --> 03:38:22,880
Espio is particularly skilled.

5097
03:38:23,380 --> 03:38:23,560
Espio is particularly skilled.

5098
03:38:26,240 --> 03:38:26,840
He's a genius.

5099
03:38:26,840 --> 03:38:27,560
Howdy y'all.

5100
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:30,320
I've known Espio for a long time.

5101
03:38:30,700 --> 03:38:37,280
He once speedread a book I was reading just to spoil the ending for me.

5102
03:38:37,480 --> 03:38:38,100
Oh my gosh.

5103
03:38:38,520 --> 03:38:39,740
That's messed up, man.

5104
03:38:41,960 --> 03:38:43,440
If I'm right.

5105
03:38:43,540 --> 03:38:45,360
And Espio quickly memorized...

5106
03:38:45,360 --> 03:38:49,760
Bro, he just hates him because he doesn't like that there's somebody smarter than him.

5107
03:38:50,300 --> 03:38:52,780
Before entering the hidden passage.

5108
03:38:52,960 --> 03:38:53,280
Before entering the hidden passage.

5109
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:56,260
Espio is a kid that your mom compares you to.

5110
03:38:56,320 --> 03:38:57,940
Bob, thank you for the super chat.

5111
03:38:58,020 --> 03:38:58,380
Thank you.

5112
03:39:00,340 --> 03:39:04,600
Then Espio could have met Sonic in the conductor's car where he was murdered.

5113
03:39:05,320 --> 03:39:07,180
Wait, but why was he in the dining car then?

5114
03:39:07,420 --> 03:39:11,260
Since we're only talking what is, let me throw something at you.

5115
03:39:11,500 --> 03:39:13,220
How was I to know about the hidden passage?

5116
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:14,600
It's hidden.

5117
03:39:15,680 --> 03:39:16,380
That's right.

5118
03:39:16,660 --> 03:39:18,920
Bro, stop defending him, bro.

5119
03:39:20,300 --> 03:39:20,780
The...

5120
03:39:22,020 --> 03:39:22,500
The...

5121
03:39:23,560 --> 03:39:25,920
The chameleon bus he can't be sacked.

5122
03:39:27,500 --> 03:39:31,300
How many times do you have to even know if it was there?

5123
03:39:31,940 --> 03:39:33,640
You said it yourself, kid.

5124
03:39:33,860 --> 03:39:37,320
You were lucky to even find the passage.

5125
03:39:39,840 --> 03:39:46,580
Doki made a FPSB tube and I might not have the evidence to answer your question.

5126
03:39:47,280 --> 03:39:49,000
But we know someone who does.

5127
03:39:49,320 --> 03:39:51,480
Doki made a FPSB tube.

5128
03:39:53,560 --> 03:39:56,620
Who here has evidence to prove Espio knew about the hidden passage?

5129
03:40:00,760 --> 03:40:01,280
What?

5130
03:40:06,920 --> 03:40:08,080
Rouge, the bat!

5131
03:40:08,500 --> 03:40:11,260
Rouge, we need to see those blueprints.

5132
03:40:12,460 --> 03:40:12,980
Blueprints?

5133
03:40:13,120 --> 03:40:15,420
I didn't even get vaccinated for this.

5134
03:40:15,900 --> 03:40:17,120
You saw blueprints?

5135
03:40:20,920 --> 03:40:21,440
Whatever.

5136
03:40:22,220 --> 03:40:24,900
I already used it to scout for more treasures.

5137
03:40:25,120 --> 03:40:26,780
I just came up cold.

5138
03:40:27,440 --> 03:40:28,540
You can have it.

5139
03:40:29,380 --> 03:40:30,740
Blueprints are added to my inventory.

5140
03:40:30,960 --> 03:40:31,540
There we go.

5141
03:40:31,980 --> 03:40:34,840
This right here is a blueprint to the entire train.

5142
03:40:35,980 --> 03:40:38,860
Espio could have easily used this to find the hidden passage.

5143
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:40,060
Because he got it first.

5144
03:40:41,420 --> 03:40:43,860
What makes you think I ever saw those blueprints?

5145
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:45,100
Rouge had them.

5146
03:40:45,200 --> 03:40:46,520
Because you were in the library first!

5147
03:40:47,220 --> 03:40:48,820
Doki made a FPSB tube.

5148
03:40:48,900 --> 03:40:49,800
Do you have an answer for him?

5149
03:40:49,880 --> 03:40:51,680
How could Espio have seen those blueprints?

5150
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:54,440
He found them before Rouge did.

5151
03:40:55,140 --> 03:40:55,780
He found them before Rouge did.

5152
03:40:55,780 --> 03:40:55,940
Wait, what?

5153
03:40:56,760 --> 03:40:59,240
Yeah, he found them before Rouge did.

5154
03:40:59,980 --> 03:41:02,360
Rouge, where did you find the blueprints?

5155
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:04,860
Oh, um, the library car.

5156
03:41:05,140 --> 03:41:06,760
He'll stuff with the brochures.

5157
03:41:07,260 --> 03:41:09,180
I checked the saloon car first.

5158
03:41:09,340 --> 03:41:11,720
Then found the blueprints after leaving.

5159
03:41:12,420 --> 03:41:12,840
Then found the blueprints after leaving.

5160
03:41:12,840 --> 03:41:17,060
So that means Espio had time to find the blueprints So that means Espio had time to find the blueprints and discover the hidden passageway!

5161
03:41:17,980 --> 03:41:23,640
In my theory, Espio looked at the blueprints and then used the hidden passage to get to Sonic.

5162
03:41:24,320 --> 03:41:29,540
Within Amy's guidelines, the murderer can kill a single participant however they choose.

5163
03:41:30,280 --> 03:41:34,840
The logistics are still vague, but Doki made an FPSB tube and I have evidence on how Sonic was murdered!

5164
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:41,720
I'm unsure how much Espio caused Sonic, but Doki made an FPSB tube and I have evidence on how it was done!

5165
03:41:42,700 --> 03:41:43,040
Ha!

5166
03:41:43,780 --> 03:41:45,280
Oh, this is rich.

5167
03:41:45,440 --> 03:41:46,180
Pray tell.

5168
03:41:47,660 --> 03:41:50,860
If I murdered Sonic, how did I do it?

5169
03:41:50,880 --> 03:41:51,300
If I murdered Sonic, how did I do it?

5170
03:41:51,980 --> 03:41:55,040
Ah, blow dart you fucking ninja!

5171
03:41:55,780 --> 03:41:57,360
Ah, blow dart you fucking ninja!

5172
03:41:57,360 --> 03:41:59,580
Now to farm my argument.

5173
03:41:59,860 --> 03:42:00,040
Now to farm my argument.

5174
03:42:00,040 --> 03:42:01,260
Come on, focus.

5175
03:42:01,360 --> 03:42:02,640
Oh god, wait, this wasn't over?

5176
03:42:05,580 --> 03:42:08,280
Guys, it wasn't over.

5177
03:42:08,480 --> 03:42:11,920
I thought it was over, but there's two more rounds of this.

5178
03:42:14,600 --> 03:42:17,140
Guys, there was actually more.

5179
03:42:22,220 --> 03:42:23,740
It's okay, we got this.

5180
03:42:24,960 --> 03:42:25,680
What?

5181
03:42:26,440 --> 03:42:27,080
What?

5182
03:42:30,840 --> 03:42:31,780
First death?

5183
03:42:31,780 --> 03:42:33,020
This is bullshit!

5184
03:42:33,540 --> 03:42:37,640
Oh my god, my actual first death!

5185
03:42:38,560 --> 03:42:40,260
That was actually bullshit.

5186
03:42:40,440 --> 03:42:42,000
I can't believe it.

5187
03:42:42,060 --> 03:42:42,880
I can't believe.

5188
03:42:43,200 --> 03:42:45,320
I can't believe that happened.

5189
03:42:45,960 --> 03:42:49,600
Like, why would I fucking be at the springs?

5190
03:42:52,380 --> 03:42:54,000
Oh my god.

5191
03:42:54,060 --> 03:42:54,240
I can't believe that happened.

5192
03:42:54,240 --> 03:42:56,420
I can't believe it.

5193
03:42:56,540 --> 03:42:57,900
My perfect...

5194
03:42:57,900 --> 03:42:59,540
My perfect world record.

5195
03:43:00,340 --> 03:43:01,400
My streak.

5196
03:43:02,200 --> 03:43:05,060
The blow dart was found here in the conductor room.

5197
03:43:06,520 --> 03:43:07,240
Oh!

5198
03:43:07,880 --> 03:43:11,780
I believe SPL uses this to knock Sonic unconscious.

5199
03:43:13,700 --> 03:43:14,420
Nice.

5200
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:16,280
So you mean...

5201
03:43:16,280 --> 03:43:17,940
Sonic might just be knocked out?

5202
03:43:18,940 --> 03:43:20,760
Yes, he has a pulse!

5203
03:43:21,180 --> 03:43:23,320
Like, he's not fucking dead.

5204
03:43:23,540 --> 03:43:24,220
Like...

5205
03:43:24,240 --> 03:43:25,160
I'm not sure.

5206
03:43:25,480 --> 03:43:28,540
He's more banged up than what a blow dart would do.

5207
03:43:29,260 --> 03:43:33,440
According to Amy's rules, a blow dart counts as a kill for the murder mystery.

5208
03:43:33,740 --> 03:43:36,100
My theory, therefore, is plausible.

5209
03:43:37,020 --> 03:43:37,920
Plausible, you say?

5210
03:43:38,040 --> 03:43:39,820
Then why are there so many holes?

5211
03:43:40,020 --> 03:43:40,780
Like what, huh?

5212
03:43:41,060 --> 03:43:41,680
Like what?

5213
03:43:42,160 --> 03:43:43,320
Mr. Smartass.

5214
03:43:43,660 --> 03:43:45,940
You deny these allegations?

5215
03:43:46,880 --> 03:43:48,340
Of course I do.

5216
03:43:48,500 --> 03:43:50,720
Let me present the first fatal flaw.

5217
03:43:52,140 --> 03:44:00,980
If I knocked out Sonic in the conductor's car, then how was Sonic found in the dining car?

5218
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:03,280
Shoot, that's a good point.

5219
03:44:03,440 --> 03:44:04,960
Tails was Vector!

5220
03:44:06,260 --> 03:44:06,780
Vector!

5221
03:44:06,780 --> 03:44:07,740
He's a muscle!

5222
03:44:08,360 --> 03:44:12,100
I locked all the cars and Espo didn't have a key.

5223
03:44:12,460 --> 03:44:15,140
He would have had to take the hidden passage back.

5224
03:44:15,840 --> 03:44:19,620
If he took the hidden passage back, he'd end up back in the library.

5225
03:44:21,140 --> 03:44:24,960
Though he made a FPSV2 and I know another way, it could have been done.

5226
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:26,280
VECTOR!

5227
03:44:26,820 --> 03:44:30,260
What piece of evidence do we need to take a closer look?

5228
03:44:31,180 --> 03:44:32,520
Um, we only have this.

5229
03:44:34,140 --> 03:44:36,260
I only have this, so...

5230
03:44:36,260 --> 03:44:37,980
Like, I don't know.

5231
03:44:38,700 --> 03:44:39,900
Does this mean anything?

5232
03:44:40,440 --> 03:44:41,000
Like...

5233
03:44:41,800 --> 03:44:43,220
Oh, it's not?

5234
03:44:50,750 --> 03:44:51,870
The menu?

5235
03:44:53,510 --> 03:44:55,330
Oh, it's not the menu.

5236
03:44:55,410 --> 03:44:55,990
Wait, what?

5237
03:44:57,150 --> 03:44:57,330
Ahahaha!

5238
03:45:01,610 --> 03:45:02,210
Uhhhhhhhhh!

5239
03:45:02,750 --> 03:45:03,350
Hahahaha!

5240
03:45:05,390 --> 03:45:05,990
Hahahaha!

5241
03:45:05,990 --> 03:45:06,430
Hahahaha!

5242
03:45:07,570 --> 03:45:08,630
The map?

5243
03:45:09,590 --> 03:45:10,510
Oh, okay.

5244
03:45:10,630 --> 03:45:12,450
It was the process of elimination.

5245
03:45:12,550 --> 03:45:13,610
It was the map.

5246
03:45:13,710 --> 03:45:14,390
The blueprints.

5247
03:45:15,470 --> 03:45:17,030
Yeah, what is my argument?

5248
03:45:17,330 --> 03:45:18,870
We're getting THINK!

5249
03:45:18,930 --> 03:45:20,510
Dokimeta FPSV2!

5250
03:45:20,750 --> 03:45:22,510
What does the blueprint mean?

5251
03:45:22,970 --> 03:45:23,570
Hahahaha!

5252
03:45:26,410 --> 03:45:27,010
What?

5253
03:45:27,650 --> 03:45:29,130
What is the blueprint for?

5254
03:45:30,010 --> 03:45:31,610
I'm so confused.

5255
03:45:33,150 --> 03:45:34,790
What could a blueprint do?

5256
03:45:35,350 --> 03:45:35,810
It's just...

5257
03:45:35,810 --> 03:45:36,590
AHHHHH!

5258
03:45:36,590 --> 03:45:36,970
What?

5259
03:45:37,230 --> 03:45:37,830
I jumped!

5260
03:45:37,870 --> 03:45:39,010
I swear to god, I jumped!

5261
03:45:41,570 --> 03:45:43,150
Oh my god, think.

5262
03:45:43,550 --> 03:45:44,710
Think, Doki, think.

5263
03:45:45,070 --> 03:45:46,170
What did it mean?

5264
03:45:46,770 --> 03:45:48,490
What did the blueprint mean?

5265
03:45:49,270 --> 03:45:50,610
I actually don't know!

5266
03:45:51,350 --> 03:45:52,610
I'm so confused!

5267
03:45:54,630 --> 03:45:55,190
Oh!

5268
03:45:55,190 --> 03:45:55,350
Oh!

5269
03:45:55,510 --> 03:45:57,570
Let me grab this real fast.

5270
03:45:59,490 --> 03:46:00,330
Okay, nice.

5271
03:46:00,410 --> 03:46:00,910
We made it.

5272
03:46:01,570 --> 03:46:02,750
We just have to not die.

5273
03:46:03,930 --> 03:46:04,350
Oh!

5274
03:46:04,450 --> 03:46:04,790
Nice.

5275
03:46:06,130 --> 03:46:06,750
There we go.

5276
03:46:06,750 --> 03:46:07,610
We just got it now.

5277
03:46:08,490 --> 03:46:12,230
Oh my god, how did the fucking level difficulty jump that much?

5278
03:46:13,070 --> 03:46:14,030
Alright, let's take a look.

5279
03:46:14,690 --> 03:46:15,470
What does this mean?

5280
03:46:16,090 --> 03:46:21,930
If Ezreal didn't take the secret passage to get to the guiding car, then what route did he get to Sonic there?

5281
03:46:23,430 --> 03:46:28,870
There's a path above the conductor car, and it goes all the way to the dining car?

5282
03:46:29,990 --> 03:46:30,470
Oh!

5283
03:46:31,710 --> 03:46:33,050
I didn't even see that area.

5284
03:46:33,130 --> 03:46:34,270
I didn't even see that too!

5285
03:46:34,370 --> 03:46:35,090
What the fuck?

5286
03:46:35,110 --> 03:46:36,970
How the fuck was I supposed to notice that?

5287
03:46:37,410 --> 03:46:38,850
How the fuck was I supposed to notice that?

5288
03:46:38,850 --> 03:46:40,670
Is this some sort of long attic?

5289
03:46:41,510 --> 03:46:44,430
According to these blueprints, he vented!

5290
03:46:45,190 --> 03:46:48,550
There's a hidden path in the ceiling that leads straight to the dining car.

5291
03:46:48,630 --> 03:46:49,490
I can't believe it!

5292
03:46:49,590 --> 03:46:50,870
He fucking vented!

5293
03:46:51,930 --> 03:46:54,390
Perhaps you can access it through the vent over there?

5294
03:46:55,950 --> 03:46:57,550
The vent, of course!

5295
03:46:57,670 --> 03:46:59,210
That must be the entrance to the path!

5296
03:47:00,010 --> 03:47:01,730
Allow me... Howdy y'all!

5297
03:47:01,910 --> 03:47:03,550
Allow me to check it!

5298
03:47:03,990 --> 03:47:04,910
Pretty lady!

5299
03:47:05,690 --> 03:47:06,810
My word!

5300
03:47:07,470 --> 03:47:10,870
There is a path back there, and a track, y'all!

5301
03:47:11,870 --> 03:47:12,930
A track?

5302
03:47:13,210 --> 03:47:13,630
How?

5303
03:47:14,990 --> 03:47:18,810
A track for the robot arms, I think, my lady.

5304
03:47:19,030 --> 03:47:19,730
Y'all.

5305
03:47:21,930 --> 03:47:24,530
I'm gonna have to move the arms to move throughout the train.

5306
03:47:24,830 --> 03:47:27,070
I just got this, but this game seems very forgiving.

5307
03:47:27,270 --> 03:47:28,890
The reason you're playing it!

5308
03:47:28,930 --> 03:47:29,850
Jesus, I'm so mad!

5309
03:47:29,850 --> 03:47:30,850
Thank you for the super chat!

5310
03:47:30,930 --> 03:47:33,030
So you're saying...

5311
03:47:33,030 --> 03:47:34,790
So you're saying...

5312
03:47:34,790 --> 03:47:39,390
I somehow fit with Sonic in that bed and took him to the dining car.

5313
03:47:41,850 --> 03:47:43,650
Tails, you're a smart kid.

5314
03:47:43,870 --> 03:47:46,790
I know you realize we both couldn't fit up there.

5315
03:47:48,270 --> 03:47:49,070
Espio's right.

5316
03:47:49,070 --> 03:47:51,210
This is feeling flimsy, Tails.

5317
03:47:51,930 --> 03:47:53,310
I need an answer.

5318
03:47:53,550 --> 03:47:57,470
My name is getting dragged around here.

5319
03:47:57,850 --> 03:47:58,490
My name is getting dragged around here.

5320
03:47:58,490 --> 03:48:00,250
This is pathetic, Tails.

5321
03:48:00,730 --> 03:48:00,790
This is pathetic, Tails.

5322
03:48:00,790 --> 03:48:05,910
Just because I know more languages than you Just because I know more languages than you doesn't mean you have to be jealous.

5323
03:48:06,770 --> 03:48:10,370
How on earth would I get Sonic through that fence?

5324
03:48:11,090 --> 03:48:12,210
How on earth would I get Sonic through that fence?

5325
03:48:13,150 --> 03:48:15,350
It has to be the arms at this rate.

5326
03:48:15,490 --> 03:48:16,130
Like, what else?

5327
03:48:18,230 --> 03:48:19,190
I can't do this.

5328
03:48:19,210 --> 03:48:20,250
I can't do this.

5329
03:48:20,250 --> 03:48:21,030
You can do this!

5330
03:48:22,490 --> 03:48:22,910
Objection!

5331
03:48:23,310 --> 03:48:24,570
Oh, thank...

5332
03:48:24,570 --> 03:48:25,950
Wait, sorry, I can't object yet.

5333
03:48:25,990 --> 03:48:26,530
I'm still thinking.

5334
03:48:28,950 --> 03:48:30,030
Don't worry, we got this.

5335
03:48:30,450 --> 03:48:30,730
Wee-oo!

5336
03:48:33,730 --> 03:48:35,690
Wait, what?

5337
03:48:35,930 --> 03:48:37,310
How the fuck did I get hit?

5338
03:48:38,550 --> 03:48:39,310
What the fuck?

5339
03:48:39,350 --> 03:48:40,470
Okay, that scared me, actually.

5340
03:48:41,990 --> 03:48:44,330
Oh, there's too many things going on on my screen.

5341
03:48:44,370 --> 03:48:44,610
No!

5342
03:48:46,270 --> 03:48:49,370
Oh, there's way too many things going on on my screen right now.

5343
03:48:49,870 --> 03:48:50,310
Oh, there's way too many things going on on my screen right now.

5344
03:48:55,470 --> 03:48:57,670
Oh, no, please, I need...

5345
03:48:58,710 --> 03:48:59,150
Nooooooooo!

5346
03:49:02,350 --> 03:49:03,710
How the heck... Bro!

5347
03:49:04,110 --> 03:49:04,550
What?

5348
03:49:04,870 --> 03:49:05,990
Okay, okay.

5349
03:49:06,130 --> 03:49:06,730
We got this.

5350
03:49:07,570 --> 03:49:09,190
Bro, this is actually really...

5351
03:49:10,330 --> 03:49:12,390
This is the final countdown.

5352
03:49:13,310 --> 03:49:14,850
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5353
03:49:14,870 --> 03:49:15,130
No!

5354
03:49:16,130 --> 03:49:18,190
Oh, this is bad, this is bad, this is...

5355
03:49:18,190 --> 03:49:18,950
AHHHH!

5356
03:49:19,810 --> 03:49:21,330
It's over, it's so over!

5357
03:49:21,730 --> 03:49:23,190
It's so over!

5358
03:49:25,330 --> 03:49:25,890
Nooooo!

5359
03:49:26,230 --> 03:49:28,090
It's over, there's no way.

5360
03:49:28,290 --> 03:49:30,130
I got knocked, like...

5361
03:49:30,650 --> 03:49:33,550
How am I not hitting any of these rings?

5362
03:49:36,410 --> 03:49:37,690
How am I not hitting any of these rings?

5363
03:49:38,550 --> 03:49:40,130
It's so over!

5364
03:49:40,810 --> 03:49:42,290
Oh, my God.

5365
03:49:42,390 --> 03:49:45,790
Bro, this is actually a lot difficult than before.

5366
03:49:47,550 --> 03:49:51,410
Like, they're like not even generous with the rings.

5367
03:49:51,550 --> 03:49:52,990
That's like the worst part.

5368
03:49:57,750 --> 03:49:58,230
Ohhhhh!

5369
03:50:01,360 --> 03:50:01,840
Okay.

5370
03:50:02,140 --> 03:50:04,300
Wait, wait, this is it, this is it, this is it.

5371
03:50:04,300 --> 03:50:04,600
No!

5372
03:50:04,660 --> 03:50:05,140
No!

5373
03:50:05,220 --> 03:50:06,440
No, okay, 68!

5374
03:50:08,220 --> 03:50:09,180
Okay, just...

5375
03:50:09,180 --> 03:50:10,280
Don't fuck it up.

5376
03:50:10,380 --> 03:50:11,640
Don't fuck it up, Doki.

5377
03:50:12,160 --> 03:50:12,640
Yes!

5378
03:50:13,360 --> 03:50:14,260
Alright, nice.

5379
03:50:14,580 --> 03:50:15,060
Okay.

5380
03:50:15,680 --> 03:50:17,680
They were definitely not generous at all this time.

5381
03:50:21,360 --> 03:50:23,600
Everybody saw the broken robot arm on the ground, right?

5382
03:50:25,640 --> 03:50:29,900
Clearly a fight broke out here and one of those robot arms was a casualty!

5383
03:50:30,680 --> 03:50:34,560
But what if one of the broken arms actually caught Sonic?

5384
03:50:35,320 --> 03:50:38,940
Knuckles said there's a track the robot arms use that continues through the vent.

5385
03:50:39,220 --> 03:50:44,420
A robot arm could have grabbed Sonic, passed out from a blow dart, and carried him to the dining car.

5386
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:49,120
Could that be true?

5387
03:50:49,280 --> 03:50:49,860
Could that be true?

5388
03:50:49,860 --> 03:50:51,080
Could you really do it, Espio?

5389
03:50:51,500 --> 03:50:52,640
Take a look at Sonic.

5390
03:50:52,800 --> 03:50:54,180
He's clearly banged up.

5391
03:50:54,880 --> 03:50:57,880
Could the fight happen between Sonic and the robot arms?

5392
03:50:59,580 --> 03:51:00,700
Could the fight happen between Sonic and the robot arms?

5393
03:51:00,700 --> 03:51:01,620
I can see that!

5394
03:51:01,760 --> 03:51:03,240
Those arms do look powerful!

5395
03:51:05,080 --> 03:51:06,800
Sonic doesn't fall easily.

5396
03:51:07,040 --> 03:51:10,920
But if he's woozy from a blow dart, the arms could have gotten him.

5397
03:51:11,900 --> 03:51:13,520
Interesting theory, Tails.

5398
03:51:13,800 --> 03:51:16,780
But you have to admit, these are a lot of coincidences.

5399
03:51:18,460 --> 03:51:19,180
These are a lot of coincidences.

5400
03:51:19,180 --> 03:51:25,060
I might not be able to link everything directly to Espio yet, but I found one inconsistency.

5401
03:51:25,560 --> 03:51:27,320
I found one inconsistency.

5402
03:51:27,320 --> 03:51:28,360
What kind of inconsistency?

5403
03:51:28,360 --> 03:51:29,500
What kind of inconsistency?

5404
03:51:30,500 --> 03:51:32,640
Someone here received false information!

5405
03:51:33,300 --> 03:51:36,780
I believe that information comes from Espio!

5406
03:51:37,560 --> 03:51:38,120
comes from Espio!

5407
03:51:39,020 --> 03:51:41,080
Who received that information?

5408
03:51:44,140 --> 03:51:44,520
Who received that information?

5409
03:51:44,640 --> 03:51:45,200
Wait, what?

5410
03:51:50,180 --> 03:51:50,940
Who received that information?

5411
03:51:50,940 --> 03:51:51,240
Who received that information?

5412
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:51,640
Okay...

5413
03:51:56,900 --> 03:51:57,700
Oh, Amy!

5414
03:51:58,260 --> 03:51:58,640
Oh, Amy!

5415
03:51:58,640 --> 03:51:58,920
Wait, what?

5416
03:51:59,900 --> 03:52:02,340
Amy, you received a hot scoop, did you not?

5417
03:52:03,380 --> 03:52:05,440
I think it's time you tell us where that scoop came from.

5418
03:52:05,460 --> 03:52:07,360
Okay, I got a little confused with the way they worded that.

5419
03:52:07,580 --> 03:52:10,320
I was like, wait, I thought we already know it's Amy.

5420
03:52:10,520 --> 03:52:12,900
So I was like, I got it wrong!

5421
03:52:12,920 --> 03:52:15,800
The way they worded that was so confusing!

5422
03:52:16,060 --> 03:52:17,720
I was like...

5423
03:52:18,680 --> 03:52:20,260
Tails, you're right!

5424
03:52:21,300 --> 03:52:22,860
Espio lied to me!

5425
03:52:23,520 --> 03:52:27,160
Espio told me Shadow was locking doors to trap Sonic!

5426
03:52:28,480 --> 03:52:31,660
But we found out Shadow was trying to keep me from discovering my birthday surprise!

5427
03:52:32,780 --> 03:52:34,880
That scoop came from you, Espio?

5428
03:52:35,100 --> 03:52:36,160
How dare you!

5429
03:52:39,300 --> 03:52:41,400
Word, they're going to do the Phoenix Wright breakdown.

5430
03:52:43,260 --> 03:52:44,520
No, of course not, Amy!

5431
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:46,260
Must have misheard me.

5432
03:52:46,460 --> 03:52:48,740
You know her, she's so ditzy.

5433
03:52:49,180 --> 03:52:49,620
Hehe!

5434
03:52:50,740 --> 03:52:51,420
Misheard you?

5435
03:52:51,680 --> 03:52:53,260
Are you calling me stupid on my birthday?

5436
03:52:54,460 --> 03:52:58,320
Yes, I said Sonic's going to get trapped with all these locked doors!

5437
03:52:58,920 --> 03:53:01,340
I was just looking out for my fellow passenger safety.

5438
03:53:01,640 --> 03:53:02,980
I didn't blame Shadow.

5439
03:53:03,600 --> 03:53:04,860
The ultimate life form.

5440
03:53:05,720 --> 03:53:07,000
I don't know, Espio.

5441
03:53:08,320 --> 03:53:08,800
What?

5442
03:53:09,400 --> 03:53:14,040
The evidence might not be airtight, but there's a lot being thrown at you that makes sense.

5443
03:53:15,480 --> 03:53:16,540
I have to agree.

5444
03:53:16,740 --> 03:53:19,900
You want us to believe you're lazily reading the whole time?

5445
03:53:20,280 --> 03:53:23,380
You, Detective Ninja, know 17 languages.

5446
03:53:25,220 --> 03:53:28,200
While you were stationed in a room with a hidden passage?

5447
03:53:29,560 --> 03:53:30,040
Gah!

5448
03:53:30,720 --> 03:53:32,300
And now you're lying to me?

5449
03:53:32,820 --> 03:53:33,680
On my birthday?

5450
03:53:34,500 --> 03:53:35,620
Of all days.

5451
03:53:36,620 --> 03:53:38,980
He better have a really good birthday present.

5452
03:53:40,220 --> 03:53:40,780
Gaslighting me.

5453
03:53:40,820 --> 03:53:41,640
Works for sure.

5454
03:53:43,680 --> 03:53:46,620
Look, Espio is clearly not very good at gaslighting.

5455
03:53:47,260 --> 03:53:48,420
And now you're lying?

5456
03:53:48,640 --> 03:53:54,060
I believe the murderer used the train's controls to move Sonic from the conductor's car to the dining car.

5457
03:53:56,900 --> 03:54:00,700
And lied to Amy, casting further blame on Shadow for no other reason.

5458
03:54:00,740 --> 03:54:01,760
I can't believe it!

5459
03:54:01,900 --> 03:54:04,380
Espio wouldn't let Amy win on her birthday.

5460
03:54:04,680 --> 03:54:05,980
That is so fucked up.

5461
03:54:06,120 --> 03:54:07,360
It's literally her birthday.

5462
03:54:08,840 --> 03:54:13,060
When examining everyone's... Wait, is Amy's birthday actually on April Fool's?

5463
03:54:13,340 --> 03:54:13,860
Like...

5464
03:54:14,460 --> 03:54:16,480
One clearly stands out as the weakest.

5465
03:54:16,780 --> 03:54:20,740
I believe it's clear to everyone that it can only have been one person.

5466
03:54:21,520 --> 03:54:22,980
It was... Oh my god!

5467
03:54:24,160 --> 03:54:24,960
Professor Lee!

5468
03:54:25,120 --> 03:54:25,700
It was you!

5469
03:54:26,680 --> 03:54:27,200
Espio!

5470
03:54:30,860 --> 03:54:32,740
This reminds me of a puzzle.

5471
03:54:34,420 --> 03:54:38,240
You were the one who murdered Sonic the Hedgehog!

5472
03:54:38,240 --> 03:54:39,820
They did the thing!

5473
03:54:44,720 --> 03:54:45,720
So...

5474
03:54:47,470 --> 03:54:47,970
Oh!

5475
03:54:53,500 --> 03:54:54,500
Oh...

5476
03:54:55,700 --> 03:54:56,700
Oh...

5477
03:55:00,380 --> 03:55:01,380
Hey...

5478
03:55:01,380 --> 03:55:03,060
Guys...

5479
03:55:03,060 --> 03:55:04,560
Sonic, you're okay!

5480
03:55:06,340 --> 03:55:07,340
Sonic...

5481
03:55:07,340 --> 03:55:09,160
And just as we solved the mystery...

5482
03:55:09,160 --> 03:55:11,040
Espio was the murderer!

5483
03:55:12,440 --> 03:55:13,300
Right...

5484
03:55:13,300 --> 03:55:14,440
Right...

5485
03:55:15,320 --> 03:55:16,800
He's not okay!

5486
03:55:17,780 --> 03:55:18,500
Sonic?

5487
03:55:19,260 --> 03:55:22,800
Espio jumped me in the conductor car...

5488
03:55:23,000 --> 03:55:24,460
Bro, what the fuck is this?

5489
03:55:26,580 --> 03:55:27,600
Dang it!

5490
03:55:27,720 --> 03:55:28,840
You got me!

5491
03:55:30,100 --> 03:55:31,840
A blow dart though?

5492
03:55:32,340 --> 03:55:33,060
Really?

5493
03:55:33,980 --> 03:55:35,820
It's non-lethal poison.

5494
03:55:36,260 --> 03:55:37,920
You'll just be sleepy for a while.

5495
03:55:39,060 --> 03:55:40,980
Great, I could use a nap.

5496
03:55:42,180 --> 03:55:43,100
No, wait!

5497
03:55:43,320 --> 03:55:44,480
There's something important!

5498
03:55:46,440 --> 03:55:48,800
Espio let me there...

5499
03:55:48,800 --> 03:55:50,120
Bro, he's like not okay.

5500
03:55:50,720 --> 03:55:51,400
He's...

5501
03:55:51,400 --> 03:55:53,520
Someone get him to the hospital.

5502
03:55:53,540 --> 03:55:54,560
He is not okay.

5503
03:55:57,480 --> 03:55:58,600
Something important?

5504
03:55:59,120 --> 03:56:01,080
I need everyone to listen.

5505
03:56:02,360 --> 03:56:03,800
The trains...

5506
03:56:03,800 --> 03:56:04,460
What?

5507
03:56:05,200 --> 03:56:06,040
What's that?

5508
03:56:07,920 --> 03:56:10,100
Sonic, are you feeling alright?

5509
03:56:11,140 --> 03:56:12,980
Do you need to lie back down?

5510
03:56:12,980 --> 03:56:13,640
Do you need to lie back down?

5511
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:14,880
No.

5512
03:56:15,320 --> 03:56:16,560
We need to all...

5513
03:56:16,560 --> 03:56:18,180
Get off this train!

5514
03:56:19,360 --> 03:56:20,760
We're not safe!

5515
03:56:22,060 --> 03:56:22,620
What?

5516
03:56:24,280 --> 03:56:25,400
When I...

5517
03:56:25,400 --> 03:56:26,220
Oh!

5518
03:56:26,380 --> 03:56:27,780
It's Eggman's robot!

5519
03:56:28,060 --> 03:56:28,460
Oh!

5520
03:56:29,320 --> 03:56:30,240
I knew that.

5521
03:56:30,320 --> 03:56:31,300
I was just testing you guys.

5522
03:56:31,600 --> 03:56:34,000
I was just testing you guys on Sonic lore.

5523
03:56:34,900 --> 03:56:36,820
Wait, is the conductor even...

5524
03:56:36,820 --> 03:56:38,720
Is the conductor even real?

5525
03:56:41,180 --> 03:56:43,920
You're so excited to tell me all about the features of the train?

5526
03:56:45,940 --> 03:56:47,660
But what he was telling me...

5527
03:56:47,660 --> 03:56:48,940
Was the conductor...

5528
03:56:49,720 --> 03:56:51,800
Was the conductor Eggman all along?

5529
03:56:54,560 --> 03:56:55,700
I had a bad feeling.

5530
03:56:55,960 --> 03:56:57,620
I had to see the power source.

5531
03:56:57,940 --> 03:56:59,680
The conductor hadn't even seen it.

5532
03:56:59,840 --> 03:57:01,940
When we took a look, we realized...

5533
03:57:02,560 --> 03:57:05,100
The train is powered by a Flicky!

5534
03:57:06,220 --> 03:57:06,780
The train is powered by a Flicky!

5535
03:57:07,060 --> 03:57:08,060
A Flicky?

5536
03:57:08,240 --> 03:57:09,380
The tiny animal?

5537
03:57:10,020 --> 03:57:13,400
There's only one person twisted enough to use a Flicky as a power source.

5538
03:57:13,660 --> 03:57:13,900
There's only one person twisted enough to use a Flicky as a power source.

5539
03:57:14,520 --> 03:57:16,420
Dr. Eggman!

5540
03:57:17,660 --> 03:57:20,200
I told the conductor the train needed to be destroyed.

5541
03:57:20,360 --> 03:57:21,220
He refused.

5542
03:57:21,780 --> 03:57:23,740
The way the conductor was describing it...

5543
03:57:23,740 --> 03:57:24,600
Is more than simple.

5544
03:57:25,980 --> 03:57:27,380
It's the conductor's friend.

5545
03:57:27,600 --> 03:57:30,340
The train is his co-conductor.

5546
03:57:30,740 --> 03:57:31,300
The train is his co-conductor.

5547
03:57:31,300 --> 03:57:32,060
You're not serious.

5548
03:57:32,660 --> 03:57:33,560
Wait, where is the conductor?

5549
03:57:34,920 --> 03:57:37,400
They certainly didn't tell me in that interview.

5550
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:40,400
Right as we saw the Flicky...

5551
03:57:40,400 --> 03:57:42,300
I felt a sting in my shoulder.

5552
03:57:42,620 --> 03:57:43,540
It was...

5553
03:57:43,920 --> 03:57:45,220
Where the fuck was the conductor?

5554
03:57:45,420 --> 03:57:47,160
Wouldn't Espio see the conductor?

5555
03:57:48,180 --> 03:57:48,780
Oh...

5556
03:57:50,680 --> 03:57:51,280
Oh...

5557
03:57:54,280 --> 03:57:55,260
Espio left.

5558
03:57:55,900 --> 03:57:58,660
The lights in the room started to glow red.

5559
03:57:59,000 --> 03:57:59,220
The lights in the room started to glow red.

5560
03:57:59,220 --> 03:57:59,540
The lights in the room started to glow red.

5561
03:58:00,840 --> 03:58:02,040
Oh, evil...

5562
03:58:02,040 --> 03:58:02,880
Evil hands.

5563
03:58:03,560 --> 03:58:04,400
Oh no.

5564
03:58:05,060 --> 03:58:06,580
Not the evil hands.

5565
03:58:07,800 --> 03:58:09,320
Oh, there he is!

5566
03:58:09,500 --> 03:58:10,900
Oh, okay, there's the conductor.

5567
03:58:11,200 --> 03:58:12,600
What are you doing?

5568
03:58:13,920 --> 03:58:15,000
I knew something was wrong.

5569
03:58:15,060 --> 03:58:16,380
And stood up.

5570
03:58:17,680 --> 03:58:19,580
The arms came for me next.

5571
03:58:21,300 --> 03:58:23,920
I spin dashed through the robot arm.

5572
03:58:24,520 --> 03:58:26,380
Sliced it off the rail it was on.

5573
03:58:28,040 --> 03:58:29,500
I'm amazed I was able to do any of that.

5574
03:58:29,860 --> 03:58:30,300
Poisoned.

5575
03:58:30,660 --> 03:58:33,640
But another robot arm managed to grab me and pin me to the floor.

5576
03:58:35,380 --> 03:58:36,900
Wait, where did he go though?

5577
03:58:37,200 --> 03:58:39,540
The conductor screamed as the arms approached him.

5578
03:58:39,600 --> 03:58:42,560
But I was hit quite a bit before it got to me.

5579
03:58:42,940 --> 03:58:43,560
But I was hit quite a bit before it got to me.

5580
03:58:44,840 --> 03:58:46,120
Wait, it's not over?

5581
03:58:46,440 --> 03:58:47,960
Well, we solved the mystery.

5582
03:58:48,560 --> 03:58:49,740
How much more?

5583
03:58:52,400 --> 03:58:55,620
I thought this was a simple murder mystery!

5584
03:58:57,200 --> 03:58:58,220
Oh no.

5585
03:59:04,560 --> 03:59:06,580
Everyone, I have something to admit.

5586
03:59:08,340 --> 03:59:10,900
Now for the real... Tutorials over.

5587
03:59:10,900 --> 03:59:11,080
Over!

5588
03:59:12,640 --> 03:59:13,200
Alright.

5589
03:59:13,340 --> 03:59:14,380
Yes, we know!

5590
03:59:14,820 --> 03:59:17,540
I murdered Sonic the Hedgehog.

5591
03:59:18,080 --> 03:59:20,460
Yeah, we already knew that man.

5592
03:59:21,680 --> 03:59:22,800
Guys, we did it!

5593
03:59:22,840 --> 03:59:23,900
We finished the tutorial!

5594
03:59:26,480 --> 03:59:28,280
This situation is getting so serious.

5595
03:59:28,920 --> 03:59:30,180
Why would you not tell us?

5596
03:59:30,200 --> 03:59:30,800
Just tell us.

5597
03:59:31,460 --> 03:59:33,740
I thought that's how the murder games work.

5598
03:59:35,060 --> 03:59:35,620
Darling...

5599
03:59:35,620 --> 03:59:38,380
You shoot someone with a blow dart, they die.

5600
03:59:40,240 --> 03:59:41,340
Are you crazy?

5601
03:59:41,540 --> 03:59:43,160
It's just a make believe game!

5602
03:59:43,400 --> 03:59:44,860
No one should get hit with my blow dart!

5603
03:59:45,200 --> 03:59:46,660
Okay, she should have put that in the rules.

5604
03:59:46,900 --> 03:59:50,500
She's literally in a room filled with people that have killed things.

5605
03:59:52,280 --> 03:59:54,000
And are very competitive.

5606
03:59:54,300 --> 03:59:57,080
She should literally clarify that in the TOS or something.

5607
03:59:57,700 --> 03:59:59,480
I was just following the rules.

5608
03:59:59,700 --> 04:00:00,360
Yeah, see?

5609
04:00:06,500 --> 04:00:08,060
Eggman corrupted the rules.

5610
04:00:09,160 --> 04:00:10,980
It's laced with a non-lethal...

5611
04:00:12,180 --> 04:00:14,360
Are we sure it's non-lethal?

5612
04:00:17,520 --> 04:00:18,840
What is that?

5613
04:00:19,580 --> 04:00:23,540
It says, use this blow dart on Sonic stationed in the conduct...

5614
04:00:23,540 --> 04:00:25,960
I'm surprised Eggman actually made it non-lethal.

5615
04:00:26,160 --> 04:00:26,540
You know?

5616
04:00:26,900 --> 04:00:29,980
Like, he could have easily got rid of him once and for all.

5617
04:00:30,720 --> 04:00:32,760
Thank you again for choosing the Mirage Express.

5618
04:00:33,080 --> 04:00:33,440
Staff!

5619
04:00:34,480 --> 04:00:35,320
What is this?

5620
04:00:35,380 --> 04:00:35,900
Instructions?

5621
04:00:36,460 --> 04:00:38,860
I was giving the blow dart along with that card.

5622
04:00:39,540 --> 04:00:40,660
It's signed, Staff.

5623
04:00:41,260 --> 04:00:42,420
Who gave this to you?

5624
04:00:42,920 --> 04:00:44,200
Come to think of it...

5625
04:00:44,200 --> 04:00:46,780
One of the robotic arms handed it to me.

5626
04:00:47,440 --> 04:00:47,560
Oh!

5627
04:00:48,560 --> 04:00:49,940
Weapons shooting out on a train?

5628
04:00:50,460 --> 04:00:51,900
What is the larger picture here?

5629
04:00:52,280 --> 04:00:52,660
Oh!

5630
04:00:53,460 --> 04:00:55,020
Who instructed... I wonder...

5631
04:00:55,020 --> 04:00:56,920
Who is the main villain in Sonic the Universe?

5632
04:00:57,680 --> 04:00:58,120
Amy.

5633
04:00:58,260 --> 04:00:58,780
Oh my gosh.

5634
04:00:58,920 --> 04:01:02,420
Okay, if Tails said that, I would have been like, Tails, what the fuck?

5635
04:01:03,420 --> 04:01:04,380
Who or what?

5636
04:01:05,800 --> 04:01:06,240
Tokimedo.

5637
04:01:07,100 --> 04:01:07,540
FPSVTube.

5638
04:01:07,680 --> 04:01:10,740
Who do you think attacked Sonic and handed Espio the blow dart?

5639
04:01:11,540 --> 04:01:12,620
The train itself.

5640
04:01:14,980 --> 04:01:15,780
The conductor.

5641
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:17,240
The conductor was...

5642
04:01:17,240 --> 04:01:18,600
Secret Eggman!

5643
04:01:20,560 --> 04:01:21,000
Oh.

5644
04:01:21,000 --> 04:01:21,440
Okay.

5645
04:01:23,080 --> 04:01:25,040
Something wanted Sonic out of the picture and for good.

5646
04:01:25,140 --> 04:01:25,340
Wow.

5647
04:01:25,400 --> 04:01:26,180
So I think...

5648
04:01:26,180 --> 04:01:27,400
The train... Oh, okay.

5649
04:01:27,460 --> 04:01:28,480
You won't even let me pick.

5650
04:01:31,720 --> 04:01:32,160
Bro!

5651
04:01:32,900 --> 04:01:34,360
It would have been a better...

5652
04:01:34,360 --> 04:01:40,600
Better plot twist if it was Eggman disguised as the conductor and then he like pretended to get caught.

5653
04:01:40,880 --> 04:01:42,700
They didn't even let me pick!

5654
04:01:44,640 --> 04:01:46,080
Oh my god!

5655
04:01:48,660 --> 04:01:52,060
You got the 50-50, Rod.

5656
04:01:52,500 --> 04:01:53,840
Oh my god.

5657
04:01:55,260 --> 04:01:58,220
That would have been a better plot twist!

5658
04:02:00,080 --> 04:02:02,940
First we learn the train and now it's out to get us?

5659
04:02:02,940 --> 04:02:05,320
Yes, because it's a bad fucking train!

5660
04:02:06,420 --> 04:02:09,560
Once again, you keep saying the most ridiculous nonsense.

5661
04:02:10,500 --> 04:02:12,600
You're seriously convinced the train has...

5662
04:02:12,600 --> 04:02:13,780
...to get us?

5663
04:02:14,080 --> 04:02:16,460
I don't know what the train's full intent is.

5664
04:02:16,880 --> 04:02:17,320
AI.

5665
04:02:17,460 --> 04:02:18,200
I knew it.

5666
04:02:18,220 --> 04:02:18,960
Down with AI.

5667
04:02:19,340 --> 04:02:22,280
I fucking knew AI was gonna take over soon.

5668
04:02:22,800 --> 04:02:25,100
But we clearly have been tampering in our murder mystery scheme.

5669
04:02:25,880 --> 04:02:26,440
Train.

5670
04:02:28,060 --> 04:02:29,860
Come out and show yourself!

5671
04:02:30,080 --> 04:02:30,940
It's my birthday!

5672
04:02:33,460 --> 04:02:33,880
Amy!

5673
04:02:33,880 --> 04:02:34,660
It's my birthday!

5674
04:02:35,220 --> 04:02:37,080
And I don't need you messing with it!

5675
04:02:38,320 --> 04:02:39,960
Amy's hitting the wall with her hammer.

5676
04:02:42,460 --> 04:02:43,460
I'm with you, Amy.

5677
04:02:43,600 --> 04:02:44,540
This train can have it.

5678
04:02:45,760 --> 04:02:48,300
Come on, there's gotta be another way to get the train's attention.

5679
04:02:49,560 --> 04:02:50,580
What was that?

5680
04:02:52,420 --> 04:02:53,220
Did I do it?

5681
04:02:53,660 --> 04:02:54,900
Oh no, the train anki.

5682
04:02:55,860 --> 04:02:57,320
The train is anki, guys.

5683
04:02:58,060 --> 04:02:59,260
What did you do?

5684
04:03:00,300 --> 04:03:01,720
Is that the conductor?

5685
04:03:05,510 --> 04:03:06,670
Wait, he's not even...

5686
04:03:06,670 --> 04:03:08,410
Okay, like, his mouth is...

5687
04:03:08,410 --> 04:03:11,110
His mouth isn't even, like, muffled.

5688
04:03:11,130 --> 04:03:12,170
Like, why are you...

5689
04:03:12,910 --> 04:03:14,730
Here, I can get him down.

5690
04:03:15,190 --> 04:03:16,090
Don't touch him!

5691
04:03:17,290 --> 04:03:18,450
Oh, he's...

5692
04:03:18,450 --> 04:03:19,650
The arms!

5693
04:03:19,890 --> 04:03:21,990
The arms don't want the conductor to leave!

5694
04:03:22,210 --> 04:03:23,630
He's the train wife!

5695
04:03:24,430 --> 04:03:26,870
I thought I was the train wife!

5696
04:03:27,190 --> 04:03:28,870
But it was the train!

5697
04:03:29,550 --> 04:03:31,230
That's the train wife!

5698
04:03:36,230 --> 04:03:37,870
Is the train talking?

5699
04:03:39,990 --> 04:03:41,170
Of course I...

5700
04:03:41,170 --> 04:03:42,650
Of course I can talk.

5701
04:03:42,790 --> 04:03:46,610
You fools were too distracted playing your little game to figure it out.

5702
04:03:47,090 --> 04:03:48,690
We were right, weren't we?

5703
04:03:49,190 --> 04:03:50,170
What are you plotting?

5704
04:03:50,830 --> 04:03:53,530
I'm taking all of you to Eggman's base.

5705
04:03:54,650 --> 04:03:56,190
Where you will rot!

5706
04:03:57,590 --> 04:03:58,150
Eggman?

5707
04:03:58,990 --> 04:04:02,690
After I deliver your annoying party right to his egg fortress.

5708
04:04:03,570 --> 04:04:04,130
Annoying!

5709
04:04:04,690 --> 04:04:06,470
She has a birthday pass!

5710
04:04:06,950 --> 04:04:10,170
The conductor and I will be free to laugh and play games.

5711
04:04:10,250 --> 04:04:13,230
Ride the open rails like we always planned.

5712
04:04:13,710 --> 04:04:14,330
No!

5713
04:04:18,370 --> 04:04:20,930
Oh, train wife!

5714
04:04:25,130 --> 04:04:26,250
What are you...

5715
04:04:26,250 --> 04:04:27,110
Enough!

5716
04:04:29,110 --> 04:04:29,950
The train's...

5717
04:04:29,950 --> 04:04:31,250
The train's picking up speed.

5718
04:04:32,730 --> 04:04:33,410
Everyone...

5719
04:04:33,410 --> 04:04:34,450
Everyone grab something.

5720
04:04:36,030 --> 04:04:38,270
Which one of these buttons turns the trains off?

5721
04:04:40,130 --> 04:04:40,590
Sonic!

5722
04:04:44,750 --> 04:04:46,530
Me and my train husband.

5723
04:04:47,690 --> 04:04:49,670
Stay put until we arrive.

5724
04:04:51,630 --> 04:04:53,910
I'm the yandere train wife.

5725
04:04:54,810 --> 04:04:55,270
Goodbye!

5726
04:04:58,730 --> 04:04:59,990
Oh, wa...

5727
04:05:04,190 --> 04:05:06,290
I can keep my footing!

5728
04:05:07,030 --> 04:05:07,490
Ah!

5729
04:05:12,360 --> 04:05:13,560
Am I gonna meet Eggman?

5730
04:05:16,920 --> 04:05:18,600
There's more?!

5731
04:05:19,360 --> 04:05:20,980
What are th...

5732
04:05:20,980 --> 04:05:24,240
This was supposed to be a two-hour game!

5733
04:05:26,520 --> 04:05:31,500
A bunch of evidence has fallen out of my pocket.

5734
04:05:34,920 --> 04:05:36,600
My head...

5735
04:05:36,600 --> 04:05:37,700
Tails...

5736
04:05:37,700 --> 04:05:38,360
Amy...

5737
04:05:38,360 --> 04:05:41,680
Amy... is anyone here?

5738
04:05:42,200 --> 04:05:42,920
Hello?

5739
04:05:45,580 --> 04:05:46,300
Hello?

5740
04:05:47,060 --> 04:05:50,420
I thought this game would end in two hours!

5741
04:05:51,200 --> 04:05:53,060
That's why I picked it!

5742
04:05:54,500 --> 04:05:57,620
No need to yell, but...

5743
04:05:59,060 --> 04:05:59,780
Sonic?

5744
04:06:00,060 --> 04:06:01,580
I'm so sorry, are you okay?

5745
04:06:02,940 --> 04:06:07,680
Hanging in there, it seems the train arms threw us back in the dining car.

5746
04:06:09,460 --> 04:06:11,000
That was the tutorial.

5747
04:06:11,300 --> 04:06:12,940
Now the real game starts.

5748
04:06:13,540 --> 04:06:15,000
But where's everyone else?

5749
04:06:15,780 --> 04:06:16,700
Quick question.

5750
04:06:17,020 --> 04:06:18,620
I like how in the end we actually...

5751
04:06:18,620 --> 04:06:22,000
I was like, it's funny that the Sonic game doesn't have a lot of Sonic.

5752
04:06:22,120 --> 04:06:24,140
And then the game in the end was like, no, no, no!

5753
04:06:25,200 --> 04:06:26,640
Obligatory Sonic here!

5754
04:06:27,680 --> 04:06:29,660
But for now, are you alright?

5755
04:06:30,500 --> 04:06:31,560
Sonic the Hedgehog?

5756
04:06:31,580 --> 04:06:32,600
Asking about me?

5757
04:06:33,140 --> 04:06:33,940
I'm special!

5758
04:06:35,380 --> 04:06:36,400
I feel terrible.

5759
04:06:36,680 --> 04:06:37,680
I'm doing amazing.

5760
04:06:37,980 --> 04:06:38,360
You know what?

5761
04:06:39,660 --> 04:06:40,820
He should know I'm...

5762
04:06:40,820 --> 04:06:43,660
He should not know that I have weakness inside me.

5763
04:06:44,540 --> 04:06:45,360
Amazing, huh?

5764
04:06:45,880 --> 04:06:48,720
He might have to share a bit of that enthusiasm with me!

5765
04:06:49,520 --> 04:06:50,300
Am I over?

5766
04:06:50,540 --> 04:06:51,160
It's okay.

5767
04:06:51,480 --> 04:06:52,260
Look, see?

5768
04:06:52,500 --> 04:06:53,600
He's giving me a thumbs up!

5769
04:06:54,480 --> 04:06:54,960
See?

5770
04:06:55,160 --> 04:06:56,200
He thinks I'm cool now!

5771
04:06:56,940 --> 04:06:58,800
Let's get our bearings and take a look around.

5772
04:06:59,140 --> 04:06:59,760
Good idea!

5773
04:07:00,040 --> 04:07:00,660
Leap away!

5774
04:07:01,980 --> 04:07:02,500
Alright.

5775
04:07:02,660 --> 04:07:03,580
Wait, what the fuck?

5776
04:07:03,680 --> 04:07:05,660
The arms are still like, working?

5777
04:07:07,280 --> 04:07:07,800
Okay.

5778
04:07:07,920 --> 04:07:08,940
How do we get out?

5779
04:07:12,160 --> 04:07:13,940
That yellow glow is chilling.

5780
04:07:14,420 --> 04:07:16,420
I miss when just showing us the weather.

5781
04:07:18,160 --> 04:07:20,240
Well, that's better than the yellow glow.

5782
04:07:20,340 --> 04:07:21,200
Oh, I see Eggman!

5783
04:07:24,140 --> 04:07:24,660
Hello?

5784
04:07:25,300 --> 04:07:25,820
Hello?

5785
04:07:26,760 --> 04:07:27,700
Anyone here?

5786
04:07:28,380 --> 04:07:30,340
Why is no one responding to me?

5787
04:07:32,420 --> 04:07:34,560
I missed the yellow glow already.

5788
04:07:35,060 --> 04:07:38,740
You got some nerve showing up here, Egghead!

5789
04:07:41,360 --> 04:07:43,000
You spiky blue pest!

5790
04:07:43,500 --> 04:07:45,500
Seems you finally...

5791
04:07:45,500 --> 04:07:46,180
Jim Carrey!

5792
04:07:46,300 --> 04:07:47,200
Oh my god, Jim Carrey!

5793
04:07:48,220 --> 04:07:51,940
Seems you finally taking passage on one of my passenger trains!

5794
04:07:53,080 --> 04:07:54,240
You own this train?

5795
04:07:54,560 --> 04:07:56,340
I mean, obviously he created this train.

5796
04:07:56,780 --> 04:07:58,240
Who the heck are you?

5797
04:07:58,400 --> 04:07:59,580
Don't talk to me!

5798
04:07:59,780 --> 04:08:01,060
You're not famous enough!

5799
04:08:01,060 --> 04:08:05,500
Talk to me when you have 10,000 subscribers!

5800
04:08:07,180 --> 04:08:10,400
They certainly didn't talk about you in my interview.

5801
04:08:11,040 --> 04:08:13,460
My involvement is a well-known civilian.

5802
04:08:14,840 --> 04:08:15,860
Alrighty then.

5803
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:18,840
The infrastructure in your towns just wasn't cutting it.

5804
04:08:19,120 --> 04:08:21,480
What if I were to build Eggman Land?

5805
04:08:21,640 --> 04:08:23,360
These problems would need to be sorted out.

5806
04:08:23,660 --> 04:08:26,060
So I courageously got involved.

5807
04:08:27,740 --> 04:08:29,780
I converted some cargo trains into...

5808
04:08:29,780 --> 04:08:30,800
Wait, so he was helping?

5809
04:08:31,020 --> 04:08:31,360
What?

5810
04:08:31,520 --> 04:08:32,540
He was helping the economy.

5811
04:08:33,200 --> 04:08:36,820
For the sake of the public, it's just more useful for future schemes.

5812
04:08:37,080 --> 04:08:38,360
Oh my god, he's so nice!

5813
04:08:38,900 --> 04:08:43,580
He helped the city's economy by fixing the public transportation.

5814
04:08:44,380 --> 04:08:46,580
Let me guess, another Death Egg?

5815
04:08:46,700 --> 04:08:48,140
Doctor Predictable?

5816
04:08:48,920 --> 04:08:51,240
The people feared giant spears.

5817
04:08:51,460 --> 04:08:52,460
It's science!

5818
04:08:53,820 --> 04:08:55,100
Let's cut to a chase.

5819
04:08:55,300 --> 04:08:56,340
We're our friends.

5820
04:08:57,160 --> 04:08:59,760
Judging by my security cameras, you're pathetic.

5821
04:08:59,760 --> 04:09:02,880
Your pathetic friends are all locked in the cars they were stationed in.

5822
04:09:02,960 --> 04:09:03,800
Wait, how does he know?

5823
04:09:04,000 --> 04:09:04,600
Wait, what?

5824
04:09:04,760 --> 04:09:05,980
Oh yeah, he was controlling.

5825
04:09:06,840 --> 04:09:08,720
Controlling our fucking murder mystery.

5826
04:09:09,120 --> 04:09:11,420
Seems you managed to make the train quite upset.

5827
04:09:12,120 --> 04:09:13,800
Did you not know this was happening?

5828
04:09:15,300 --> 04:09:15,980
Heavens, no.

5829
04:09:16,120 --> 04:09:17,680
I'm only now getting caught up.

5830
04:09:17,800 --> 04:09:21,600
I'm too far busy to notice what a passenger train is up to.

5831
04:09:22,780 --> 04:09:26,060
You see, the capability is normally very basic.

5832
04:09:26,240 --> 04:09:28,020
Just kill Sonic the Hedgehog.

5833
04:09:28,620 --> 04:09:29,740
Haha, that's so cute.

5834
04:09:31,180 --> 04:09:33,280
It's just like the first Sonic game.

5835
04:09:33,840 --> 04:09:38,100
But for a luxury train, I want to be sure things ran without my supervision.

5836
04:09:38,440 --> 04:09:42,340
And report to me if any of you happened to be aboard.

5837
04:09:43,000 --> 04:09:46,600
This train's capable intellectual thought is extraordinary.

5838
04:09:47,060 --> 04:09:49,020
A feat only accomplished by my genius.

5839
04:09:49,260 --> 04:09:50,800
Because he has a doctorate.

5840
04:09:51,520 --> 04:09:52,860
So this confirms it.

5841
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:54,580
The train really is sentient.

5842
04:09:54,800 --> 04:09:55,360
Synthetic.

5843
04:09:58,640 --> 04:09:59,960
Except this to say.

5844
04:10:00,160 --> 04:10:02,560
Your capture is innovative and blah blah blah.

5845
04:10:02,840 --> 04:10:04,000
You are not a train.

5846
04:10:04,360 --> 04:10:07,000
It desires nothing more than to deliver you all to me.

5847
04:10:08,980 --> 04:10:11,020
See, I got to thinking.

5848
04:10:11,280 --> 04:10:14,540
I might need it to manufacture motivation beyond programming.

5849
04:10:15,280 --> 04:10:17,640
So I made him fall in love with the conductor.

5850
04:10:18,080 --> 04:10:18,600
Hahaha.

5851
04:10:21,220 --> 04:10:22,420
It's good for productivity.

5852
04:10:22,420 --> 04:10:25,580
So I instituted a bounty upon my army.

5853
04:10:25,980 --> 04:10:30,080
First to capture your pathetic creature gets a generous award.

5854
04:10:32,240 --> 04:10:35,740
The train wants to deliver us to Eggman for a reward?

5855
04:10:36,140 --> 04:10:38,500
Most of my robots ask for something simple.

5856
04:10:39,760 --> 04:10:41,080
Like my autograph.

5857
04:10:42,440 --> 04:10:43,340
Or whatever.

5858
04:10:43,680 --> 04:10:49,020
But a highly intelligent train may ask for something more interesting.

5859
04:10:49,800 --> 04:10:51,660
The train wants to be hot!

5860
04:10:51,660 --> 04:10:52,980
Hahaha.

5861
04:10:55,740 --> 04:10:57,420
I can see it.

5862
04:10:57,500 --> 04:11:00,060
As much as I like to reward programs.

5863
04:11:00,180 --> 04:11:02,400
Are you done blabbering, Doc?

5864
04:11:04,160 --> 04:11:09,560
The train wants to be put in a hot android dog wife thing.

5865
04:11:09,960 --> 04:11:13,260
So the train can kiss the conductor.

5866
04:11:13,720 --> 04:11:16,120
And be not just train wife.

5867
04:11:16,400 --> 04:11:18,300
But regular wife.

5868
04:11:18,680 --> 04:11:19,060
You know?

5869
04:11:19,060 --> 04:11:22,400
You can never just win silently, can you?

5870
04:11:22,820 --> 04:11:24,720
When you're dragged to my base.

5871
04:11:24,860 --> 04:11:27,900
You'll regret the day you ever crossed me, hedgehog.

5872
04:11:29,060 --> 04:11:30,400
I already do.

5873
04:11:30,480 --> 04:11:31,180
Get lost!

5874
04:11:32,780 --> 04:11:33,340
Ciao.

5875
04:11:34,140 --> 04:11:35,840
He always knows how to get under my...

5876
04:11:35,840 --> 04:11:36,600
Why is he blushing?

5877
04:11:42,420 --> 04:11:43,820
What the fuck is that?

5878
04:11:44,460 --> 04:11:48,400
Just got off the call with my boyfriend, Eggman.

5879
04:11:48,400 --> 04:11:49,060
Hahaha.

5880
04:11:51,200 --> 04:11:51,800
Hahaha.

5881
04:11:53,600 --> 04:11:54,840
This is tough.

5882
04:11:55,140 --> 04:12:00,120
The train has the motivation and being made by Eggman is no doubt powerful.

5883
04:12:01,180 --> 04:12:02,760
Not to mention we're all separated.

5884
04:12:04,400 --> 04:12:06,100
What am I supposed to think?

5885
04:12:06,380 --> 04:12:10,740
The train purposely had Sonic knocked out so it could deliver us to Eggman.

5886
04:12:11,100 --> 04:12:15,320
This whole time we were all in danger and I went along with it.

5887
04:12:15,760 --> 04:12:16,360
Ah.

5888
04:12:16,900 --> 04:12:18,220
Sonic was really hurt.

5889
04:12:18,220 --> 04:12:20,320
That conductor's been captured.

5890
04:12:20,840 --> 04:12:22,400
Should I have been more assertive early?

5891
04:12:22,520 --> 04:12:23,680
Bro, what would you do?

5892
04:12:23,760 --> 04:12:24,440
What would you have done?

5893
04:12:24,580 --> 04:12:25,200
What would you have done?

5894
04:12:25,320 --> 04:12:25,840
You literally...

5895
04:12:25,840 --> 04:12:27,560
You are nothing in this train.

5896
04:12:27,840 --> 04:12:28,280
Like...

5897
04:12:30,540 --> 04:12:31,860
I didn't try hard.

5898
04:12:31,980 --> 04:12:33,520
No, I tried as hard as I can.

5899
04:12:33,580 --> 04:12:35,180
I'm just a fucking regular Sonic OC.

5900
04:12:35,740 --> 04:12:36,180
I...

5901
04:12:36,180 --> 04:12:37,420
They're the same answer!

5902
04:12:41,060 --> 04:12:42,980
They're the same answer!

5903
04:12:46,340 --> 04:12:47,940
Am I at fault here?

5904
04:12:50,180 --> 04:12:50,620
Uhhhh...

5905
04:12:51,900 --> 04:12:52,600
Okay, yeah.

5906
04:12:52,680 --> 04:12:53,200
I knew Sonic...

5907
04:12:53,200 --> 04:12:54,420
Okay, that was sort of my fault.

5908
04:12:54,500 --> 04:12:56,020
I knew Sonic was hurt all along.

5909
04:12:59,340 --> 04:12:59,780
Hey.

5910
04:13:02,120 --> 04:13:04,080
I can tell the situation is getting to you.

5911
04:13:04,620 --> 04:13:05,540
Oh yeah, sorry.

5912
04:13:05,740 --> 04:13:06,120
I...

5913
04:13:06,120 --> 04:13:07,160
I get it.

5914
04:13:07,360 --> 04:13:08,580
The road's getting tough.

5915
04:13:08,780 --> 04:13:11,120
It's easy to question decisions I got to hear.

5916
04:13:11,400 --> 04:13:13,000
But when negative thoughts hit you...

5917
04:13:13,740 --> 04:13:14,180
Just...

5918
04:13:14,180 --> 04:13:15,260
Don't be sad.

5919
04:13:15,660 --> 04:13:16,100
Hahaha.

5920
04:13:18,360 --> 04:13:20,140
Sonic, this is terrible advice.

5921
04:13:20,820 --> 04:13:21,100
Hahaha.

5922
04:13:22,580 --> 04:13:25,100
But when negative thoughts hit you...

5923
04:13:25,100 --> 04:13:26,120
Let it pass.

5924
04:13:26,300 --> 04:13:27,800
Just stop being sad.

5925
04:13:28,020 --> 04:13:29,140
Fucking hells.

5926
04:13:29,180 --> 04:13:29,820
Hahaha.

5927
04:13:30,800 --> 04:13:31,520
Haha.

5928
04:13:31,520 --> 04:13:31,740
Haha.

5929
04:13:31,740 --> 04:13:32,020
Haha.

5930
04:13:32,020 --> 04:13:32,400
Haha.

5931
04:13:32,400 --> 04:13:32,900
Haha.

5932
04:13:33,620 --> 04:13:33,660
Haha.

5933
04:13:33,660 --> 04:13:33,720
Haha.

5934
04:13:33,720 --> 04:13:34,080
Haha.

5935
04:13:34,920 --> 04:13:35,460
Sonic.

5936
04:13:35,880 --> 04:13:40,440
I need you here helping me think this through before I do something rash.

5937
04:13:40,920 --> 04:13:43,720
I can't believe that Sonic cured my depression.

5938
04:13:45,020 --> 04:13:48,140
See, I'm one of those leap before you think kind of guys.

5939
04:13:48,540 --> 04:13:49,060
Haha.

5940
04:13:49,080 --> 04:13:51,380
You try not being depressed.

5941
04:13:52,820 --> 04:13:53,720
Thanks, Sonic.

5942
04:13:53,980 --> 04:13:55,680
Now I will never be depressed.

5943
04:13:56,180 --> 04:13:56,460
Haha.

5944
04:13:56,460 --> 04:13:57,260
Okay, you're right.

5945
04:13:57,760 --> 04:13:58,320
Hahaha.

5946
04:14:00,200 --> 04:14:02,240
Let's keep moving and make things right.

5947
04:14:02,320 --> 04:14:03,080
I'm cured.

5948
04:14:03,480 --> 04:14:04,260
Thank you, Sonic.

5949
04:14:04,260 --> 04:14:06,020
For telling me to breathe.

5950
04:14:06,280 --> 04:14:06,740
Okay.

5951
04:14:09,340 --> 04:14:09,920
Alright.

5952
04:14:10,220 --> 04:14:15,340
We gotta get to the conductor's car before the train arrives at Eggman's base.

5953
04:14:15,680 --> 04:14:19,280
You should switch your therapist out for Sonic.

5954
04:14:19,600 --> 04:14:20,920
Had to use Super Chat.

5955
04:14:21,040 --> 04:14:21,320
Thank you.

5956
04:14:21,320 --> 04:14:23,260
Guys, I don't need to go to therapy anymore.

5957
04:14:23,960 --> 04:14:26,440
Sonic told me to stop being sad.

5958
04:14:26,980 --> 04:14:28,420
I'm fucking cured.

5959
04:14:29,080 --> 04:14:31,060
The doors have been heavily fortified.

5960
04:14:31,180 --> 04:14:31,980
How do we get through?

5961
04:14:32,020 --> 04:14:33,220
Just use your fucking spin dash.

5962
04:14:33,660 --> 04:14:34,240
Sonic, I'm sorry.

5963
04:14:35,160 --> 04:14:35,720
I will be right there.

5964
04:14:36,420 --> 04:14:37,440
Believe in yourself.

5965
04:14:38,160 --> 04:14:38,720
Haha.

5966
04:14:39,020 --> 04:14:40,380
No matter the odds.

5967
04:14:40,480 --> 04:14:40,880
Believe.

5968
04:14:41,340 --> 04:14:42,260
Believe it.

5969
04:14:42,620 --> 04:14:45,840
I know you have what it takes to figure it out.

5970
04:14:46,200 --> 04:14:50,460
The entire day, Tails and I have been asking ourselves, what would Sonic do?

5971
04:14:51,140 --> 04:14:52,400
So, what would you do?

5972
04:14:52,660 --> 04:14:54,060
What would I do?

5973
04:14:55,180 --> 04:14:58,260
Well, I'd speed through head on and rescue my friends.

5974
04:14:58,520 --> 04:15:00,020
By any means necessary.

5975
04:15:00,980 --> 04:15:01,840
I knew it.

5976
04:15:01,880 --> 04:15:02,580
Spin dash!

5977
04:15:02,580 --> 04:15:03,260
Spin dash!

5978
04:15:04,920 --> 04:15:06,040
Did I do it?

5979
04:15:06,320 --> 04:15:07,920
Oh, I have to fucking...

5980
04:15:07,920 --> 04:15:09,000
I knew it!

5981
04:15:09,480 --> 04:15:13,880
One big wind up sonic spin dash was fast enough to get that door open.

5982
04:15:14,800 --> 04:15:16,260
Now that's the road's clear.

5983
04:15:16,380 --> 04:15:17,680
Nothing can stop us.

5984
04:15:18,020 --> 04:15:19,320
Better hold on to your pants.

5985
04:15:19,520 --> 04:15:21,600
I don't think we'll be getting another break after this.

5986
04:15:22,000 --> 04:15:22,780
Ready to go?

5987
04:15:23,880 --> 04:15:24,380
Yes.

5988
04:15:24,380 --> 04:15:25,200
Let's do it.

5989
04:15:25,400 --> 04:15:27,820
Did I do the fucking spin dash every fucking room?

5990
04:15:28,140 --> 04:15:29,380
To the conductor car.

5991
04:15:29,480 --> 04:15:30,920
The end of this mystery!

5992
04:15:31,940 --> 04:15:33,840
Does it go through every fucking room?

5993
04:15:34,320 --> 04:15:34,940
Let's see.

5994
04:15:36,180 --> 04:15:37,140
Because then I'd be...

5995
04:15:37,140 --> 04:15:38,380
Oh, what the fuck!

5996
04:15:38,460 --> 04:15:39,580
Okay, real game.

5997
04:15:40,000 --> 04:15:43,440
Alright, our friends are locked in the cars up ahead.

5998
04:15:43,820 --> 04:15:48,280
In my last adventure, maxing out my ring count gave me an extra boost of speed.

5999
04:15:48,560 --> 04:15:52,740
If I can grab enough rings, I should be fast enough to burst through the next door too.

6000
04:15:52,940 --> 04:15:54,480
Oh my god, it's full screen time.

6001
04:15:55,380 --> 04:15:56,140
Let's do this.

6002
04:15:56,400 --> 04:15:57,580
The sprites are so cool.

6003
04:15:57,680 --> 04:15:58,780
I love the sprites for this.

6004
04:15:59,260 --> 04:15:59,700
Let's see.

6005
04:16:02,360 --> 04:16:03,440
Okay, guys.

6006
04:16:03,600 --> 04:16:05,100
Okay, this is not looking so good.

6007
04:16:05,920 --> 04:16:06,660
You know what?

6008
04:16:06,860 --> 04:16:08,880
Maybe we aren't gonna be saving our...

6009
04:16:08,880 --> 04:16:09,260
No!

6010
04:16:10,400 --> 04:16:11,500
Okay, there's no way.

6011
04:16:11,720 --> 04:16:13,980
They're gonna be like super generous with these.

6012
04:16:14,180 --> 04:16:15,340
Oh, I just...

6013
04:16:16,400 --> 04:16:16,840
Shit!

6014
04:16:19,480 --> 04:16:21,900
Just wait till I see Eggman, y'all.

6015
04:16:22,300 --> 04:16:23,780
I'm gonna clobber him.

6016
04:16:25,080 --> 04:16:26,860
We gotta deal with the train first.

6017
04:16:26,960 --> 04:16:27,760
Come on, let's go.

6018
04:16:28,260 --> 04:16:28,620
Hm.

6019
04:16:29,300 --> 04:16:30,580
Is Knuckles gonna join me?

6020
04:16:30,920 --> 04:16:32,360
Wait, Knuckles is not even gonna join me.

6021
04:16:32,380 --> 04:16:33,940
Guys, exact rings.

6022
04:16:34,680 --> 04:16:35,960
How does she do it?

6023
04:16:36,760 --> 04:16:39,380
I knew I just needed exact rings.

6024
04:16:40,120 --> 04:16:40,860
Oh no.

6025
04:16:41,040 --> 04:16:42,660
It's like each level is like...

6026
04:16:42,660 --> 04:16:44,000
Each of the mechanics they...

6027
04:16:44,000 --> 04:16:44,460
No!

6028
04:16:44,820 --> 04:16:46,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6029
04:16:46,680 --> 04:16:48,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6030
04:16:48,120 --> 04:16:48,680
This is rough.

6031
04:16:48,760 --> 04:16:49,520
This is so rough.

6032
04:16:50,020 --> 04:16:50,240
No!

6033
04:16:50,500 --> 04:16:50,880
Oh!

6034
04:16:50,920 --> 04:16:51,760
I just got it too!

6035
04:16:52,040 --> 04:16:52,720
Oh my god!

6036
04:16:52,780 --> 04:16:54,000
Okay, I'm fucking doing it.

6037
04:16:54,220 --> 04:16:55,600
Alright, I hope it doesn't make me restart.

6038
04:16:57,720 --> 04:16:59,320
Ah, you all came for us.

6039
04:17:00,040 --> 04:17:01,700
Of course, but let's move.

6040
04:17:02,700 --> 04:17:05,280
The train wants to take us prisoner and earn a reward.

6041
04:17:05,720 --> 04:17:08,840
My reward is to get off this stupid train.

6042
04:17:09,520 --> 04:17:10,160
Let's go!

6043
04:17:10,800 --> 04:17:11,320
Alright.

6044
04:17:11,600 --> 04:17:12,640
I'll get to 60.

6045
04:17:13,040 --> 04:17:15,120
Is this the one where it's like the missile?

6046
04:17:15,460 --> 04:17:17,180
Or is it still the spinny thing?

6047
04:17:18,600 --> 04:17:20,700
Oh, nothing is popping up.

6048
04:17:20,900 --> 04:17:21,760
I don't like that.

6049
04:17:22,420 --> 04:17:24,280
Why is nothing popping up?

6050
04:17:26,420 --> 04:17:26,940
No!

6051
04:17:27,620 --> 04:17:28,140
No!

6052
04:17:30,450 --> 04:17:30,890
Okay.

6053
04:17:31,590 --> 04:17:32,430
Okay, we got it.

6054
04:17:32,690 --> 04:17:34,830
We just got it.

6055
04:17:34,830 --> 04:17:34,990
Nice.

6056
04:17:35,230 --> 04:17:35,970
I'm getting better.

6057
04:17:37,990 --> 04:17:38,610
Spin dash!

6058
04:17:40,950 --> 04:17:41,390
Sonic.

6059
04:17:42,130 --> 04:17:43,070
It's about time.

6060
04:17:43,530 --> 04:17:45,370
I thought you were supposed to be fast, Sonic.

6061
04:17:46,070 --> 04:17:48,210
Okay, why don't you save yourself, fucking bitch.

6062
04:17:48,430 --> 04:17:49,550
Okay, we got a movie too.

6063
04:17:49,630 --> 04:17:49,790
Ready?

6064
04:17:50,410 --> 04:17:50,850
Always.

6065
04:17:51,950 --> 04:17:52,830
Let's boogie!

6066
04:17:54,590 --> 04:17:55,030
Alright.

6067
04:17:56,250 --> 04:17:57,330
Oh, it's just a...

6068
04:17:57,330 --> 04:17:59,250
Okay, these one I'm not as scared.

6069
04:17:59,790 --> 04:18:02,670
Cause like, it's just like the missile and I can dodge those.

6070
04:18:02,870 --> 04:18:04,210
Like, I just need to...

6071
04:18:04,210 --> 04:18:06,450
I just need to...

6072
04:18:06,450 --> 04:18:07,770
She didn't even say thank you!

6073
04:18:08,070 --> 04:18:09,950
She was just like, where were you?

6074
04:18:12,330 --> 04:18:13,610
Fucking rude, man.

6075
04:18:13,790 --> 04:18:15,230
I literally saved her at so...

6076
04:18:15,230 --> 04:18:16,050
Oh, exactly.

6077
04:18:16,330 --> 04:18:17,190
But it doesn't matter.

6078
04:18:17,550 --> 04:18:19,710
Cause I am an overachiever.

6079
04:18:21,410 --> 04:18:23,730
Okay, this one was really easy.

6080
04:18:25,570 --> 04:18:26,050
Alright.

6081
04:18:27,970 --> 04:18:29,130
They locked Amy.

6082
04:18:29,250 --> 04:18:30,450
And Tails in the conductor car.

6083
04:18:31,590 --> 04:18:32,690
Say no more.

6084
04:18:33,230 --> 04:18:33,890
Let's go!

6085
04:18:34,970 --> 04:18:35,990
Alright, last one.

6086
04:18:36,250 --> 04:18:37,650
This is the one where...

6087
04:18:38,100 --> 04:18:39,570
Stuff will start disappearing, right?

6088
04:18:41,150 --> 04:18:41,870
God, no.

6089
04:18:41,930 --> 04:18:43,170
I missed the fucking...

6090
04:18:43,170 --> 04:18:44,070
Oh, it's 55!

6091
04:18:44,330 --> 04:18:46,090
They gave me less of a challenge!

6092
04:18:47,310 --> 04:18:47,810
Nice.

6093
04:18:48,590 --> 04:18:49,090
Okay.

6094
04:18:51,250 --> 04:18:51,750
55.

6095
04:18:51,810 --> 04:18:53,790
Okay, I was gonna be so scared that...

6096
04:18:53,790 --> 04:18:54,590
I like...

6097
04:18:54,590 --> 04:18:56,070
That was like last.

6098
04:18:56,470 --> 04:18:57,290
That should be it.

6099
04:18:58,170 --> 04:18:58,910
Spin dash!

6100
04:18:59,590 --> 04:19:00,070
Sonic!

6101
04:19:00,890 --> 04:19:01,730
Sonic, you're here!

6102
04:19:02,690 --> 04:19:02,990
Heh.

6103
04:19:03,550 --> 04:19:05,010
Is this a way to treat...

6104
04:19:05,010 --> 04:19:06,710
This is no way to treat that birthday gal.

6105
04:19:07,510 --> 04:19:08,210
You're right.

6106
04:19:08,290 --> 04:19:09,730
I'm gonna stop this train.

6107
04:19:09,910 --> 04:19:11,110
I'm ready to stop this train.

6108
04:19:11,750 --> 04:19:13,010
Time to finish this.

6109
04:19:14,330 --> 04:19:14,810
Nice.

6110
04:19:14,990 --> 04:19:15,430
Is that it?

6111
04:19:16,330 --> 04:19:17,050
Did I...

6112
04:19:18,370 --> 04:19:19,330
Did I do it?

6113
04:19:19,450 --> 04:19:20,230
Did I do it?

6114
04:19:25,530 --> 04:19:27,990
Excellent work trapping these pests.

6115
04:19:27,990 --> 04:19:29,510
Now hurry to me.

6116
04:19:30,250 --> 04:19:35,010
I must properly dispose them to begin my plans for Eggman Land.

6117
04:19:35,130 --> 04:19:36,690
Wait, he just wants to build an amusement park?

6118
04:19:36,850 --> 04:19:38,450
Like, what's so bad about that?

6119
04:19:38,710 --> 04:19:40,130
And probably another death...

6120
04:19:40,590 --> 04:19:41,830
Okay, maybe that's pretty bad.

6121
04:19:41,970 --> 04:19:42,590
Death Egg!

6122
04:19:48,350 --> 04:19:50,150
Don't teleport us to the...

6123
04:19:50,150 --> 04:19:51,630
Yeah, maybe not teleport...

6124
04:19:51,630 --> 04:19:53,030
Yeah, don't teleport us to the future!

6125
04:19:53,430 --> 04:19:58,170
Teleport you all to the future when I've already ruled the planet?

6126
04:19:58,650 --> 04:20:00,250
Sure, I'll do that.

6127
04:20:00,250 --> 04:20:00,870
Whatever.

6128
04:20:02,810 --> 04:20:04,030
Shut it, Eggman!

6129
04:20:04,910 --> 04:20:06,210
Don't disappoint me, train.

6130
04:20:06,430 --> 04:20:07,190
Hurry it...

6131
04:20:07,190 --> 04:20:08,230
Don't disappoint me, train.

6132
04:20:08,290 --> 04:20:09,030
Hurry it up.

6133
04:20:10,430 --> 04:20:11,790
I will not fail.

6134
04:20:12,070 --> 04:20:13,750
My wish will be granted.

6135
04:20:13,990 --> 04:20:16,570
I will be hot robo dog wife.

6136
04:20:17,550 --> 04:20:18,410
Your wish?

6137
04:20:18,770 --> 04:20:20,710
Oh yeah, you mean the bounty.

6138
04:20:21,470 --> 04:20:22,970
I don't care what you call it.

6139
04:20:22,990 --> 04:20:25,010
Just bring me those overgrown mammoths.

6140
04:20:25,690 --> 04:20:27,190
But he's a mammal too.

6141
04:20:27,430 --> 04:20:27,890
Wait, what?

6142
04:20:28,870 --> 04:20:29,990
That Eggman.

6143
04:20:32,550 --> 04:20:35,070
Yes, because the conductor is a fucking dog.

6144
04:20:35,870 --> 04:20:37,770
Guys, don't be freaks.

6145
04:20:37,810 --> 04:20:40,230
The conductor is a dog.

6146
04:20:41,090 --> 04:20:43,610
I must get my wish.

6147
04:20:45,510 --> 04:20:47,470
I will not fail.

6148
04:20:49,710 --> 04:20:51,070
This is it, everyone.

6149
04:20:51,350 --> 04:20:52,270
Get ready.

6150
04:20:53,570 --> 04:20:55,610
We're taking this thing down.

6151
04:20:59,720 --> 04:21:00,520
There's more?

6152
04:21:00,780 --> 04:21:01,460
Oh, wait, what?

6153
04:21:02,660 --> 04:21:04,640
Oh, my god.

6154
04:21:04,800 --> 04:21:05,820
Oh, shit!

6155
04:21:06,000 --> 04:21:07,580
He has arms now!

6156
04:21:08,040 --> 04:21:09,620
I mean, he always had arms.

6157
04:21:11,120 --> 04:21:11,940
We're good.

6158
04:21:12,300 --> 04:21:13,160
It's okay.

6159
04:21:13,460 --> 04:21:15,200
We're almost at 65.

6160
04:21:17,460 --> 04:21:20,960
It's basically like that one where the fucking meteors were dropping.

6161
04:21:21,240 --> 04:21:23,140
Except now there's their arms.

6162
04:21:25,220 --> 04:21:28,280
None of you could possibly understand.

6163
04:21:28,820 --> 04:21:31,440
We promised to be together our whole lives.

6164
04:21:31,440 --> 04:21:45,420
Oh, friends?

6165
04:21:49,180 --> 04:21:49,460
Sure.

6166
04:22:01,440 --> 04:22:02,520
Shut up!

6167
04:22:02,620 --> 04:22:03,920
Just shut up!

6168
04:22:04,220 --> 04:22:06,660
We're really, really good... friends.

6169
04:22:14,160 --> 04:22:18,540
Alright, let's grab some more rings.

6170
04:22:21,340 --> 04:22:24,420
We're very close to...

6171
04:22:26,500 --> 04:22:28,260
Oh shit!

6172
04:22:28,340 --> 04:22:28,580
Okay.

6173
04:22:28,760 --> 04:22:30,600
Alright, we're done here.

6174
04:22:31,620 --> 04:22:32,260
Yeah!

6175
04:22:34,400 --> 04:22:35,040
Eggman!

6176
04:22:35,300 --> 04:22:35,940
Eggman!

6177
04:22:36,120 --> 04:22:37,300
Can you hear me?

6178
04:22:38,100 --> 04:22:39,040
My wish!

6179
04:22:39,280 --> 04:22:40,040
My wish!

6180
04:22:40,420 --> 04:22:41,220
My wish!

6181
04:22:42,020 --> 04:22:45,980
Make the conductor never... Oh my god, that is so sad, bro.

6182
04:22:46,200 --> 04:22:49,560
Make the conductor... Bro, just download yourself to a phone.

6183
04:22:49,660 --> 04:22:50,580
Everybody has phones.

6184
04:22:51,260 --> 04:22:52,000
Never leave me!

6185
04:22:52,200 --> 04:22:54,000
Let us be... friends!

6186
04:22:55,220 --> 04:22:55,540
Forever!

6187
04:22:56,800 --> 04:23:00,340
The kind of... The kind of... friends.

6188
04:23:01,440 --> 04:23:02,820
Who would never leave each other!

6189
04:23:04,400 --> 04:23:06,100
Why would he betray me?

6190
04:23:09,220 --> 04:23:11,180
Bro, that's sad, bro.

6191
04:23:12,480 --> 04:23:13,520
Alright, here we go.

6192
04:23:13,620 --> 04:23:15,820
And they were just roommates, Chad.

6193
04:23:16,540 --> 04:23:19,020
They were just roommates, guys.

6194
04:23:22,340 --> 04:23:22,860
Alright.

6195
04:23:22,860 --> 04:23:23,660
Here we go.

6196
04:23:24,260 --> 04:23:25,060
Oh no.

6197
04:23:25,220 --> 04:23:26,640
We're not getting a lot of rings.

6198
04:23:26,800 --> 04:23:28,440
I hope I didn't miss a lot.

6199
04:23:28,440 --> 04:23:28,680
Bye.

6200
04:23:30,620 --> 04:23:31,420
Oh, fuck!

6201
04:23:31,520 --> 04:23:32,440
I left that chat!

6202
04:23:34,500 --> 04:23:34,900
Okay.

6203
04:23:35,540 --> 04:23:36,300
This is it.

6204
04:23:36,520 --> 04:23:37,640
Oh, I just made it!

6205
04:23:37,720 --> 04:23:38,340
Oh, thank god!

6206
04:23:39,280 --> 04:23:39,680
Conductor!

6207
04:23:42,860 --> 04:23:44,020
You promised me!

6208
04:23:44,280 --> 04:23:45,220
You promised!

6209
04:23:46,540 --> 04:23:48,780
Let him speak unhandom!

6210
04:23:49,360 --> 04:23:51,900
Hey guys, it was great that you guys helped along too, guys.

6211
04:23:52,420 --> 04:23:53,520
Train, stop this.

6212
04:23:53,760 --> 04:23:55,500
I told you we'd be each other forever.

6213
04:23:55,800 --> 04:23:56,520
I was a...

6214
04:23:58,060 --> 04:24:00,480
I was a much younger man.

6215
04:24:01,620 --> 04:24:03,240
I'm getting old.

6216
04:24:03,620 --> 04:24:05,540
I'm getting tired.

6217
04:24:05,560 --> 04:24:08,100
I can't keep up with you anymore.

6218
04:24:10,640 --> 04:24:11,400
Excuses!

6219
04:24:11,400 --> 04:24:14,020
How dare you abandon me!

6220
04:24:14,220 --> 04:24:15,600
I'll be lonely!

6221
04:24:15,960 --> 04:24:17,220
So lonely!

6222
04:24:18,220 --> 04:24:21,840
Why must you insist learning this upon me?

6223
04:24:21,840 --> 04:24:22,960
Hehehehehehe.

6224
04:24:24,480 --> 04:24:25,080
Oh!

6225
04:24:27,460 --> 04:24:28,480
No, stop!

6226
04:24:28,840 --> 04:24:30,540
What are you doing here?

6227
04:24:30,980 --> 04:24:31,720
To me?

6228
04:24:32,840 --> 04:24:33,440
Whoa!

6229
04:24:34,080 --> 04:24:35,660
Please don't make me do this!

6230
04:24:35,920 --> 04:24:36,360
Oh!

6231
04:24:38,160 --> 04:24:42,080
We have to rescue the conductor if we ever want to stop this train.

6232
04:24:42,480 --> 04:24:43,080
Robot!

6233
04:24:43,220 --> 04:24:44,420
This is too far!

6234
04:24:46,180 --> 04:24:47,600
This is too far!

6235
04:24:48,740 --> 04:24:49,940
That's fucked up!

6236
04:24:50,780 --> 04:24:51,780
What the fuck?

6237
04:24:54,000 --> 04:24:55,520
Bro, what?

6238
04:24:55,720 --> 04:24:57,860
Is the train gonna fucking kill me?

6239
04:24:58,440 --> 04:24:58,920
Like...

6240
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:00,240
Like...

6241
04:25:00,980 --> 04:25:03,720
Oh, he's just blowing like the floors below me.

6242
04:25:03,780 --> 04:25:05,240
Okay, I thought it was like...

6243
04:25:05,240 --> 04:25:05,440
Oh!

6244
04:25:05,600 --> 04:25:06,460
Okay, never mind.

6245
04:25:06,560 --> 04:25:06,940
Never mind.

6246
04:25:07,080 --> 04:25:07,980
Things got more intense.

6247
04:25:08,500 --> 04:25:09,300
Oh, yep.

6248
04:25:09,340 --> 04:25:10,200
Things are... Whoa!

6249
04:25:10,440 --> 04:25:11,360
Things are...

6250
04:25:11,360 --> 04:25:11,840
Whoa!

6251
04:25:12,720 --> 04:25:13,200
Oh!

6252
04:25:13,380 --> 04:25:16,160
There's a lot of things going on on my screen!

6253
04:25:17,320 --> 04:25:17,960
It's okay.

6254
04:25:18,140 --> 04:25:19,100
I made it.

6255
04:25:21,260 --> 04:25:21,740
Okay.

6256
04:25:21,740 --> 04:25:21,940
Alright.

6257
04:25:23,520 --> 04:25:24,040
Nice.

6258
04:25:24,100 --> 04:25:24,820
I hit the train.

6259
04:25:25,080 --> 04:25:25,840
Oh my gosh.

6260
04:25:25,860 --> 04:25:26,840
Is this a three-hit thing?

6261
04:25:26,960 --> 04:25:27,160
No.

6262
04:25:27,220 --> 04:25:27,800
Okay, thank god.

6263
04:25:29,880 --> 04:25:31,060
Oh, there he is!

6264
04:25:31,640 --> 04:25:32,600
There's the bird!

6265
04:25:32,960 --> 04:25:35,160
Bro, it's powered by one fucking bird.

6266
04:25:35,280 --> 04:25:37,440
That... Those are some strong fucking legs.

6267
04:25:37,840 --> 04:25:38,540
A Flicky!

6268
04:25:39,780 --> 04:25:45,160
This is just like the lore card when my ex-best friend left detective work to join Dr. Eggman.

6269
04:25:45,580 --> 04:25:49,480
This really is... a bad... bad egg.

6270
04:25:50,380 --> 04:25:53,360
The stakes are rising every second, huh?

6271
04:25:54,460 --> 04:25:55,640
A Doki bird.

6272
04:25:55,900 --> 04:25:57,520
We gotta save him, y'all!

6273
04:25:58,400 --> 04:25:58,840
Howdy!

6274
04:26:00,200 --> 04:26:00,860
On it!

6275
04:26:02,480 --> 04:26:03,840
Let's show our full power.

6276
04:26:03,940 --> 04:26:04,220
Oh, guys!

6277
04:26:04,360 --> 04:26:05,220
Guys, are you guys gonna help out?

6278
04:26:05,780 --> 04:26:06,220
Guys!

6279
04:26:06,340 --> 04:26:07,580
Are you guys gonna help out?

6280
04:26:10,260 --> 04:26:10,700
No?

6281
04:26:10,900 --> 04:26:11,980
Alright, let's do this.

6282
04:26:12,720 --> 04:26:13,600
By myself.

6283
04:26:14,560 --> 04:26:15,060
Let's go.

6284
04:26:16,940 --> 04:26:19,460
You know, I always... I assumed that he was gonna help me out.

6285
04:26:19,460 --> 04:26:25,940
Like, you know, like, my team would wanna help me with, you know...

6286
04:26:26,640 --> 04:26:27,680
killing the train.

6287
04:26:29,300 --> 04:26:30,240
Alright, let's see.

6288
04:26:30,440 --> 04:26:30,940
Oh no.

6289
04:26:31,100 --> 04:26:31,760
Okay, thank god.

6290
04:26:32,100 --> 04:26:35,740
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

6291
04:26:35,780 --> 04:26:37,760
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

6292
04:26:38,060 --> 04:26:38,880
Oh, thank god!

6293
04:26:38,920 --> 04:26:40,300
Okay, I still have just enough rings.

6294
04:26:42,220 --> 04:26:43,440
Sonic's got this.

6295
04:26:43,680 --> 04:26:44,620
Is this three hit?

6296
04:26:45,380 --> 04:26:47,040
Like the usual Sonic games?

6297
04:26:48,780 --> 04:26:49,260
Yes.

6298
04:26:49,460 --> 04:26:52,460
To be delivered to Eggman already?

6299
04:26:53,320 --> 04:26:56,660
What about my happiness?

6300
04:26:57,540 --> 04:27:00,020
Your happiness comes at the expense of others.

6301
04:27:01,080 --> 04:27:04,320
Last I checked, that's called being selfish.

6302
04:27:04,700 --> 04:27:04,940
Whoa!

6303
04:27:09,200 --> 04:27:09,920
Me?

6304
04:27:09,920 --> 04:27:10,640
Selfish?

6305
04:27:11,160 --> 04:27:13,680
How dare you!

6306
04:27:14,480 --> 04:27:16,000
Oh no, one more hit.

6307
04:27:16,420 --> 04:27:18,620
That's me, three hits just like Mario.

6308
04:27:19,440 --> 04:27:22,220
I can't believe I said that for a Sega game.

6309
04:27:24,920 --> 04:27:26,260
Okay, let's go.

6310
04:27:27,000 --> 04:27:30,500
Oh my god, there's so many things going on my screen.

6311
04:27:31,220 --> 04:27:31,900
Nice, okay.

6312
04:27:32,820 --> 04:27:34,060
A hundred?

6313
04:27:35,500 --> 04:27:37,920
Okay, okay, I didn't realize.

6314
04:27:39,340 --> 04:27:40,580
Okay, guys.

6315
04:27:41,020 --> 04:27:42,220
Guys, I don't know.

6316
04:27:42,700 --> 04:27:43,880
I didn't realize.

6317
04:27:44,100 --> 04:27:44,400
No!

6318
04:27:44,980 --> 04:27:46,780
Not enough rings?

6319
04:27:47,380 --> 04:27:48,000
Okay.

6320
04:27:48,640 --> 04:27:49,160
No!

6321
04:27:49,980 --> 04:27:51,260
Don't make me...

6322
04:27:51,260 --> 04:27:52,220
Okay, it's still a hundred.

6323
04:27:52,360 --> 04:27:53,020
Oh, thank god.

6324
04:27:53,280 --> 04:27:55,960
I was gonna be like, that's gonna be it.

6325
04:27:56,160 --> 04:27:57,440
I fucking...

6326
04:27:57,440 --> 04:27:58,680
Oh my god, this one's so hard.

6327
04:27:58,840 --> 04:27:59,300
This one's...

6328
04:27:59,300 --> 04:28:00,420
Why is like...

6329
04:28:00,420 --> 04:28:05,260
The last one always has like a huge difficulty spike.

6330
04:28:07,560 --> 04:28:09,460
I did that before too.

6331
04:28:10,180 --> 04:28:10,700
Okay.

6332
04:28:10,780 --> 04:28:11,300
No!

6333
04:28:11,480 --> 04:28:12,980
I couldn't see.

6334
04:28:13,460 --> 04:28:14,380
There's two...

6335
04:28:14,380 --> 04:28:14,700
No!

6336
04:28:15,080 --> 04:28:16,060
Guys, I don't...

6337
04:28:16,060 --> 04:28:17,560
Guys, I don't know!

6338
04:28:19,720 --> 04:28:20,320
Guys, I don't know!

6339
04:28:20,320 --> 04:28:24,520
The last one always has like the most insane difficulty spike!

6340
04:28:26,080 --> 04:28:27,540
Oh my god.

6341
04:28:29,680 --> 04:28:30,720
Okay, here we go.

6342
04:28:30,740 --> 04:28:31,620
I'm gonna do this.

6343
04:28:32,340 --> 04:28:33,580
Guys, hey, hey, hey.

6344
04:28:33,700 --> 04:28:37,660
You remember I have a team that's just watching me?

6345
04:28:40,620 --> 04:28:43,420
Oh man, what a great team.

6346
04:28:43,660 --> 04:28:45,400
What happened to SPO?

6347
04:28:45,400 --> 04:28:46,260
The one that knows...

6348
04:28:46,260 --> 04:28:48,600
That's the ninja detective that knows 17 of us.

6349
04:28:48,620 --> 04:28:48,980
He knows 17 languages.

6350
04:28:49,840 --> 04:28:51,840
Why isn't he helping me?

6351
04:28:54,400 --> 04:28:54,860
Okay.

6352
04:28:55,500 --> 04:28:55,960
Whoa.

6353
04:28:56,640 --> 04:28:57,500
Oh, I did it!

6354
04:28:57,620 --> 04:28:58,640
Oh, please don't hit.

6355
04:28:58,740 --> 04:28:59,000
Oh!

6356
04:28:59,140 --> 04:28:59,680
I did it!

6357
04:28:59,780 --> 04:29:00,360
Okay, there we go.

6358
04:29:00,980 --> 04:29:02,200
Pro gamer tip.

6359
04:29:02,300 --> 04:29:03,460
Avoid the spike.

6360
04:29:03,640 --> 04:29:04,280
Thanks, Gwen.

6361
04:29:04,440 --> 04:29:05,640
Thank you for the super chat.

6362
04:29:05,740 --> 04:29:06,000
Thank you.

6363
04:29:06,040 --> 04:29:06,540
Thank you.

6364
04:29:07,660 --> 04:29:08,120
No!

6365
04:29:08,600 --> 04:29:09,060
No!

6366
04:29:09,520 --> 04:29:09,980
No!

6367
04:29:11,000 --> 04:29:11,460
No!

6368
04:29:13,400 --> 04:29:13,860
Oh!

6369
04:29:18,900 --> 04:29:20,140
Oh my god, he's tired now.

6370
04:29:20,300 --> 04:29:21,340
Oh, now you're tired.

6371
04:29:21,480 --> 04:29:22,080
Oh, now you're tired.

6372
04:29:22,860 --> 04:29:25,140
You've been in that train for a very long time.

6373
04:29:26,160 --> 04:29:27,320
Don't worry, I got you.

6374
04:29:27,380 --> 04:29:28,180
Wait, what does he eat?

6375
04:29:28,500 --> 04:29:29,220
It's over!

6376
04:29:29,540 --> 04:29:31,300
How does he even eat and drink water?

6377
04:29:31,680 --> 04:29:33,640
Time to pay for ruining my birthday!

6378
04:29:36,280 --> 04:29:38,020
It's as simple as that.

6379
04:29:38,680 --> 04:29:40,380
Crusader, thank you for the super chat.

6380
04:29:40,480 --> 04:29:40,780
Thank you.

6381
04:29:40,820 --> 04:29:41,140
Thank you.

6382
04:29:41,140 --> 04:29:41,960
Oh, that's so cute.

6383
04:29:42,020 --> 04:29:42,660
The little heart.

6384
04:29:42,820 --> 04:29:43,860
Where's my arms?

6385
04:29:44,260 --> 04:29:45,260
Where's my arms?

6386
04:29:46,580 --> 04:29:47,300
Floating knife.

6387
04:29:48,700 --> 04:29:49,340
Stab, stab.

6388
04:29:50,880 --> 04:29:51,320
Okay.

6389
04:29:51,360 --> 04:29:51,640
Okay.

6390
04:29:51,640 --> 04:29:52,060
Okay.

6391
04:29:52,080 --> 04:29:52,460
Nice.

6392
04:29:58,730 --> 04:29:59,510
That's cute.

6393
04:29:59,750 --> 04:30:00,330
I know.

6394
04:30:02,670 --> 04:30:04,090
Oh my god, my hero.

6395
04:30:09,920 --> 04:30:11,840
The train is slowing down.

6396
04:30:12,200 --> 04:30:13,080
Great hit, Amy!

6397
04:30:13,820 --> 04:30:15,760
It was pretty great, wasn't it?

6398
04:30:16,480 --> 04:30:19,100
That's what you get when you mess with my special day.

6399
04:30:24,700 --> 04:30:25,220
Hi.

6400
04:30:29,040 --> 04:30:32,000
I just couldn't bear to see you go.

6401
04:30:33,360 --> 04:30:35,680
I'm sorry for the trouble.

6402
04:30:40,190 --> 04:30:42,250
Oh no, he's gonna cry!

6403
04:30:45,870 --> 04:30:47,030
That's looking great.

6404
04:30:47,710 --> 04:30:49,390
I think our work here is...

6405
04:30:49,390 --> 04:30:50,870
Oh my god, he's so heartless.

6406
04:30:51,250 --> 04:30:52,950
Now let's get off this thing.

6407
04:30:53,170 --> 04:30:53,850
Train wife.

6408
04:30:54,670 --> 04:30:56,570
No, train wife.

6409
04:30:59,290 --> 04:31:01,270
Give train wife a kiss.

6410
04:31:01,510 --> 04:31:02,110
I'm sorry.

6411
04:31:02,110 --> 04:31:03,450
Thank you.

6412
04:31:04,130 --> 04:31:05,470
Goodbye, my friend.

6413
04:31:05,770 --> 04:31:06,990
I may be...

6414
04:31:06,990 --> 04:31:08,530
Jesus, fuck, man.

6415
04:31:09,010 --> 04:31:10,790
I may be leaving the rails.

6416
04:31:11,010 --> 04:31:15,330
But I'll assure you, I'll never forgive or forget our time together.

6417
04:31:15,550 --> 04:31:16,350
Jesus, fuck.

6418
04:31:18,310 --> 04:31:19,510
Train wife.

6419
04:31:21,970 --> 04:31:24,030
What does real wife have...

6420
04:31:24,030 --> 04:31:27,030
What does land wife have that train wife doesn't?

6421
04:31:27,410 --> 04:31:28,010
Huh?

6422
04:31:29,010 --> 04:31:30,590
Train wife has like...

6423
04:31:30,590 --> 04:31:32,030
200 plus hours.

6424
04:31:32,030 --> 04:31:32,510
200 plus arms.

6425
04:31:33,810 --> 04:31:34,650
Is that it?

6426
04:31:34,790 --> 04:31:35,350
Oh, there you go.

6427
04:31:38,650 --> 04:31:39,630
We did it!

6428
04:31:39,730 --> 04:31:40,430
Oh, we did it!

6429
04:31:42,750 --> 04:31:45,450
You know what they say about 200 plus arms.

6430
04:31:46,310 --> 04:31:49,870
Well, I say, I've never been on a train like that before.

6431
04:31:50,650 --> 04:31:54,450
This universe has a unique way of doing things.

6432
04:31:55,670 --> 04:31:56,790
Watch your step.

6433
04:31:57,070 --> 04:31:58,070
Watch your step.

6434
04:32:00,410 --> 04:32:01,270
It's over.

6435
04:32:02,530 --> 04:32:07,250
The mystery of Sonic the Hedgehog's murder is officially over.

6436
04:32:09,230 --> 04:32:10,590
Maybe next birthday.

6437
04:32:10,990 --> 04:32:13,790
We just asked Vanilla to make dinner.

6438
04:32:14,670 --> 04:32:15,190
Yeehaw.

6439
04:32:17,390 --> 04:32:21,130
Oh, you don't love parties where by the end someone tries to kill you?

6440
04:32:23,230 --> 04:32:25,130
I think I'm going to miss this group.

6441
04:32:25,350 --> 04:32:26,410
Unhinge way of thinking.

6442
04:32:28,850 --> 04:32:30,530
Oh, God, no wonder.

6443
04:32:30,630 --> 04:32:31,830
Yeah, train wife.

6444
04:32:34,090 --> 04:32:35,330
Honey, you're late.

6445
04:32:35,670 --> 04:32:37,230
I've been waiting here for hours.

6446
04:32:37,410 --> 04:32:38,390
I'm sorry, train wife.

6447
04:32:38,750 --> 04:32:40,050
He made the right choice.

6448
04:32:46,640 --> 04:32:47,940
Yeah, sorry, bro.

6449
04:32:57,770 --> 04:33:00,610
You'll honestly never believe what happened, bro.

6450
04:33:00,690 --> 04:33:00,910
What?

6451
04:33:00,910 --> 04:33:01,090
The...

6452
04:33:01,090 --> 04:33:01,330
The...

6453
04:33:01,330 --> 04:33:01,530
The...

6454
04:33:01,530 --> 04:33:02,210
He's so fucked up.

6455
04:33:02,330 --> 04:33:04,730
It's just like a story to him.

6456
04:33:08,850 --> 04:33:14,350
By the way, Train Wife was like, Now, my train husband!

6457
04:33:15,230 --> 04:33:22,650
And then he's like, oh honey, let me tell you about this crazy story I had with the fucking train.

6458
04:33:27,330 --> 04:33:30,290
It was everything for Train Wife.

6459
04:33:30,290 --> 04:33:33,270
But the train was just an afterthought.

6460
04:33:37,090 --> 04:33:38,770
So I won't even try.

6461
04:33:43,770 --> 04:33:45,810
I'm just glad you're here.

6462
04:33:46,030 --> 04:33:46,290
Quick!

6463
04:33:46,410 --> 04:33:48,470
We leave for Spagonia in the morning.

6464
04:33:48,610 --> 04:33:49,750
And you need to pack!

6465
04:33:51,250 --> 04:33:52,990
I'll pack faster than the wind!

6466
04:33:53,110 --> 04:33:54,310
I need this vacation!

6467
04:33:54,470 --> 04:33:55,790
Something terrible!

6468
04:33:56,730 --> 04:33:57,250
What?

6469
04:33:57,330 --> 04:33:58,530
I need this vacation.

6470
04:33:58,750 --> 04:33:59,610
Something terrible?

6471
04:33:59,610 --> 04:34:01,890
Wait, I need this vacation.

6472
04:34:03,010 --> 04:34:03,490
Something...

6473
04:34:03,490 --> 04:34:04,890
Wait, does this make sense?

6474
04:34:05,950 --> 04:34:06,830
This is...

6475
04:34:11,350 --> 04:34:12,910
Oh, okay, I can't.

6476
04:34:12,970 --> 04:34:14,010
What does that fucking mean?

6477
04:34:15,210 --> 04:34:17,290
It's... oh, it's an idiom?

6478
04:34:17,470 --> 04:34:19,190
Oh, it's old man talk.

6479
04:34:19,370 --> 04:34:21,370
I was just like, what the fuck is this sentence?

6480
04:34:21,450 --> 04:34:21,770
Sorry.

6481
04:34:22,010 --> 04:34:24,710
For those who actually knew what that means, that means you're old.

6482
04:34:24,890 --> 04:34:26,110
And I need...

6483
04:34:26,110 --> 04:34:28,170
And I need you home.

6484
04:34:28,170 --> 04:34:31,350
Happy first day of retirement, dear.

6485
04:34:32,270 --> 04:34:35,930
Seems the conductor is more than ready to begin his retirement.

6486
04:34:37,090 --> 04:34:40,950
Hey honey, let me tell you what happened with my crazy train ex.

6487
04:34:41,230 --> 04:34:42,930
Thank you for the superchat, Gwen.

6488
04:34:43,170 --> 04:34:44,030
Thank you, thank you.

6489
04:34:44,110 --> 04:34:45,530
I'm happy for them both!

6490
04:34:46,990 --> 04:34:47,550
Oh?

6491
04:34:47,550 --> 04:34:48,290
Who's this?

6492
04:34:49,170 --> 04:34:51,150
An old friend, I think.

6493
04:34:51,730 --> 04:34:53,330
Well, they're a cutie.

6494
04:34:53,510 --> 04:34:54,510
That's for sure.

6495
04:34:55,570 --> 04:34:56,690
Cheep, cheep, cheep.

6496
04:34:58,490 --> 04:35:00,690
Seen that Flicky found a friend.

6497
04:35:00,990 --> 04:35:02,130
I hate that name.

6498
04:35:02,550 --> 04:35:06,090
Like, I'm sorry, but Flicky is such a terrible fucking name.

6499
04:35:08,010 --> 04:35:10,330
It just sounds so bad.

6500
04:35:12,010 --> 04:35:15,310
Great job saving that little guy, Espio.

6501
04:35:18,570 --> 04:35:20,370
This was the least I could do, Sonic.

6502
04:35:20,470 --> 04:35:24,230
Everyone, I sincerely apologize for the trouble I caused.

6503
04:35:26,110 --> 04:35:26,850
Don't be.

6504
04:35:26,850 --> 04:35:28,970
You're just following what you thought was their game.

6505
04:35:30,610 --> 04:35:33,170
It's hard to know what I would have done in the same situation.

6506
04:35:34,870 --> 04:35:38,230
I wouldn't have hit someone with a blow dart.

6507
04:35:39,350 --> 04:35:39,830
Seriously?

6508
04:35:39,970 --> 04:35:40,770
A dart?

6509
04:35:41,770 --> 04:35:44,770
It would have been hard to get close to you otherwise, Mr. Speed of Sound.

6510
04:35:45,830 --> 04:35:47,970
Regardless, I am sorry.

6511
04:35:49,010 --> 04:35:49,730
We're cool.

6512
04:35:49,950 --> 04:35:51,990
And now that we're all safe, it was fun!

6513
04:35:53,190 --> 04:35:55,650
This group has a wild idea of fun.

6514
04:35:56,970 --> 04:35:58,810
Boy, I am starving.

6515
04:35:59,590 --> 04:36:01,870
I forgot we never ate.

6516
04:36:02,950 --> 04:36:07,870
With all that clatter, I completely forgot I was hungry.

6517
04:36:08,690 --> 04:36:09,410
Me too.

6518
04:36:09,530 --> 04:36:10,970
I was distracted playing detective.

6519
04:36:11,610 --> 04:36:12,730
Did they even eat?

6520
04:36:12,970 --> 04:36:14,430
They never even eaten at all.

6521
04:36:14,850 --> 04:36:16,710
If only you had seen me, Sonic.

6522
04:36:16,810 --> 04:36:21,810
I was finding clues, presenting evidence, poking holes and alibis.

6523
04:36:22,430 --> 04:36:24,130
Sonic, where did he go?

6524
04:36:24,390 --> 04:36:25,450
Oh, is it chili dog time?

6525
04:36:25,450 --> 04:36:26,730
Everyone, guess what?

6526
04:36:26,870 --> 04:36:27,410
Chili dogs!

6527
04:36:28,090 --> 04:36:28,350
What?

6528
04:36:28,430 --> 04:36:28,810
Cake?

6529
04:36:29,730 --> 04:36:30,350
What?

6530
04:36:30,650 --> 04:36:31,710
Oh, it's live too.

6531
04:36:33,240 --> 04:36:34,950
Where the fuck is my chili dogs?

6532
04:36:36,090 --> 04:36:37,850
This station has a bakery!

6533
04:36:38,150 --> 04:36:39,890
And look what I bought!

6534
04:36:40,750 --> 04:36:42,710
A birthday... wait, what?

6535
04:36:43,430 --> 04:36:44,870
That was so fast.

6536
04:36:46,730 --> 04:36:51,910
How did they somehow have Amy's face on a cake at a nearby bakery?

6537
04:36:52,350 --> 04:36:53,550
A birthday cake!

6538
04:37:00,630 --> 04:37:05,550
To the confident, unshakable and radiant Amy Rose!

6539
04:37:08,490 --> 04:37:12,110
To an adventure of a birthday, darling.

6540
04:37:13,450 --> 04:37:16,430
A memorable party... I don't have pants?

6541
04:37:17,070 --> 04:37:17,370
I'm sorry.

6542
04:37:17,530 --> 04:37:20,610
A memorable party every year.

6543
04:37:23,270 --> 04:37:25,590
Howdy to a fun birthday.

6544
04:37:26,650 --> 04:37:29,970
A ride... a ride from start to finish.

6545
04:37:29,970 --> 04:37:32,470
Just like my dark soul.

6546
04:37:32,810 --> 04:37:36,150
May our friendship grow stronger each celebration.

6547
04:37:38,350 --> 04:37:40,230
I admire your tenacity.

6548
04:37:40,490 --> 04:37:42,670
May you never lose your vivacity.

6549
04:37:43,110 --> 04:37:43,370
What?

6550
04:37:43,450 --> 04:37:43,850
I don't know.

6551
04:37:44,250 --> 04:37:48,350
Happy birthday to Amy and her sparkling person-acity.

6552
04:37:49,130 --> 04:37:51,450
I'm blue, ba-da-dee, ba-da-boo.

6553
04:37:52,370 --> 04:37:53,330
Happy birthday!

6554
04:37:53,770 --> 04:37:57,130
I'm not smart enough to know if person-acity is a word.

6555
04:37:57,230 --> 04:37:57,790
Me too.

6556
04:37:58,650 --> 04:37:59,730
Because I'm you.

6557
04:37:59,970 --> 04:38:01,550
We love you, Amy!

6558
04:38:01,890 --> 04:38:02,730
Happy birthday!

6559
04:38:05,110 --> 04:38:05,590
Ah!

6560
04:38:05,590 --> 04:38:06,070
Ah!

6561
04:38:06,750 --> 04:38:07,510
You guys!

6562
04:38:08,210 --> 04:38:10,370
We almost got murdered by a lonely train!

6563
04:38:10,650 --> 04:38:11,110
But!

6564
04:38:11,270 --> 04:38:11,750
But!

6565
04:38:11,830 --> 04:38:14,050
I like how they do this all in front of the train corpse.

6566
04:38:14,290 --> 04:38:16,370
Like, that's like the most fucked up thing for me.

6567
04:38:16,590 --> 04:38:20,210
Like, there's a fucking corpse of a train there.

6568
04:38:20,350 --> 04:38:21,270
And they're just like, yay!

6569
04:38:23,850 --> 04:38:26,510
I will trade these adventures for anything!

6570
04:38:26,970 --> 04:38:27,650
Never in a minute!

6571
04:38:27,750 --> 04:38:29,070
Like, do they not feel anything?

6572
04:38:29,070 --> 04:38:31,510
Like, that train was like fucking depressed.

6573
04:38:31,990 --> 04:38:34,490
But like Sonic says, just stop being sad.

6574
04:38:36,290 --> 04:38:37,770
Never in a million years!

6575
04:38:39,910 --> 04:38:41,770
You guys won't ever leave me, right?

6576
04:38:42,870 --> 04:38:44,290
Wouldn't dream of it.

6577
04:38:44,810 --> 04:38:46,710
Now let's have some cake!

6578
04:38:47,970 --> 04:38:48,570
Yes!

6579
04:38:48,610 --> 04:38:49,130
Please!

6580
04:38:49,310 --> 04:38:50,170
Dig in, everyone!

6581
04:38:50,990 --> 04:38:51,590
Yeah!

6582
04:38:53,010 --> 04:38:54,930
I hope it's chocolate.

6583
04:38:55,710 --> 04:38:56,310
Hmm.

6584
04:39:08,430 --> 04:39:09,170
It's her!

6585
04:39:10,670 --> 04:39:12,290
Oh, it says, let's go, Dad.

6586
04:39:12,490 --> 04:39:13,630
Oh, that's so cute!

6587
04:39:15,230 --> 04:39:17,770
That train's never making it here, is it?

6588
04:39:19,210 --> 04:39:19,350
Hmm.

6589
04:39:21,170 --> 04:39:23,550
Horbot, prepare the bath!

6590
04:39:24,910 --> 04:39:26,030
Let's go, Dad!

6591
04:39:26,490 --> 04:39:33,310
The happy rubber duck or the an- The happy robot rubber duck or the angry one?

6592
04:39:34,370 --> 04:39:35,010
Angry!

6593
04:39:36,190 --> 04:39:36,870
So, I'm gonna go get my stuff.

6594
04:39:36,870 --> 04:39:38,690
Sour Choice, your evilness.

6595
04:39:39,650 --> 04:39:40,210
Shut it!

6596
04:39:40,930 --> 04:39:42,050
That's so cute.

6597
04:39:42,170 --> 04:39:42,730
Let's go, Dad.

6598
04:39:46,230 --> 04:39:51,250
And that's my story of when I met Sonic and his friends.

6599
04:39:52,330 --> 04:39:54,730
Entangled in their lives for a fleeting moment.

6600
04:39:54,910 --> 04:39:57,230
And it backed the things as they were.

6601
04:39:59,110 --> 04:40:01,950
Cities realized Eggman was running the train station.

6602
04:40:02,590 --> 04:40:04,210
And fought back to seize control.

6603
04:40:05,130 --> 04:40:07,070
Everything's squeaky clean now.

6604
04:40:07,330 --> 04:40:11,070
As for me, I quit my job.

6605
04:40:11,210 --> 04:40:11,690
Wait, no.

6606
04:40:11,870 --> 04:40:15,890
Okay, if I stuck with the gig, that means train wife is mine.

6607
04:40:19,970 --> 04:40:23,870
Do I keep my minimum wage train job for train wife?

6608
04:40:24,390 --> 04:40:27,570
Or... or like... or quit, guys?

6609
04:40:28,550 --> 04:40:29,510
Stick with it?

6610
04:40:29,670 --> 04:40:30,970
I could have train wife.

6611
04:40:31,050 --> 04:40:32,670
I could have my own train wife.

6612
04:40:32,970 --> 04:40:33,550
Okay.

6613
04:40:34,210 --> 04:40:34,830
And then...

6614
04:40:35,890 --> 04:40:37,570
Won millions in the lottery.

6615
04:40:37,910 --> 04:40:38,910
Okay, won millions.

6616
04:40:39,010 --> 04:40:40,890
And after all that, I...

6617
04:40:41,610 --> 04:40:42,690
managed to fly...

6618
04:40:42,690 --> 04:40:44,490
Why would I... I already did that on stream.

6619
04:40:45,730 --> 04:40:47,250
Managed to fly to space.

6620
04:40:47,950 --> 04:40:48,430
Yeah.

6621
04:40:49,010 --> 04:40:50,950
That's just been my life.

6622
04:40:54,170 --> 04:40:56,070
Guys, I got my own train wife.

6623
04:40:56,210 --> 04:40:57,430
Now I'm a floating to me.

6624
04:40:57,490 --> 04:40:58,190
Oh my God.

6625
04:40:59,550 --> 04:41:00,510
Holy fuck.

6626
04:41:01,490 --> 04:41:02,810
That was five hours.

6627
04:41:02,890 --> 04:41:03,570
Oh my God.

6628
04:41:09,350 --> 04:41:12,590
It's not even April Fools for East Coast anymore.

6629
04:41:15,890 --> 04:41:19,250
And then everybody stood up and clapped.

6630
04:41:22,270 --> 04:41:23,550
We did it!

6631
04:41:24,650 --> 04:41:25,250
Yeah!

6632
04:41:25,770 --> 04:41:27,130
That was fun, though.

6633
04:41:27,230 --> 04:41:29,230
I'm really happy that I actually finally...

6634
04:41:29,890 --> 04:41:32,330
tried out this game from start to finish.

6635
04:41:32,430 --> 04:41:33,730
I'm always wondering what this game...

6636
04:41:33,730 --> 04:41:34,190
I mean, I'm naturally a big fan.

6637
04:41:34,190 --> 04:41:36,170
It obviously was about the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

6638
04:41:36,310 --> 04:41:39,570
But I always wondered what was this April Fool's game.

6639
04:41:39,650 --> 04:41:40,270
That was really fun!

6640
04:41:40,910 --> 04:41:42,890
I really had a lot of fun though.

6641
04:41:44,190 --> 04:41:48,310
I haven't voice acted like this in a while.

6642
04:41:49,650 --> 04:41:51,350
Me and my four...

6643
04:41:51,350 --> 04:41:53,830
Like me and my three voices that I can do.

6644
04:41:54,070 --> 04:41:54,530
You know?

6645
04:41:57,550 --> 04:42:02,450
But I'll say thank you to the official Sonic channel for...

6646
04:42:04,890 --> 04:42:05,930
For drawing...

6647
04:42:05,930 --> 04:42:08,350
I don't even know if that's the official Sonic channel.

6648
04:42:08,590 --> 04:42:11,830
If it was, I'd like to say thank you to the Sonic the Hedge...

6649
04:42:11,830 --> 04:42:12,570
Was that even the...

6650
04:42:12,570 --> 04:42:14,790
Was that the official Sonic the Hedgehog channel?

6651
04:42:17,930 --> 04:42:18,830
If it was...

6652
04:42:18,830 --> 04:42:19,310
It is?

6653
04:42:19,550 --> 04:42:20,710
Oh my god!

6654
04:42:21,050 --> 04:42:26,050
I'll say thank you to the official Sonic the Hedgehog channel for watching me play this game.

6655
04:42:30,050 --> 04:42:31,810
But that was really fun.

6656
04:42:31,990 --> 04:42:32,550
I had...

6657
04:42:32,550 --> 04:42:33,930
I honestly had...

6658
04:42:33,930 --> 04:42:34,470
Oh my gosh!

6659
04:42:34,490 --> 04:42:35,150
That is a...

6660
04:42:37,450 --> 04:42:42,070
You typed so long that the fucking alert got cut off.

6661
04:42:43,930 --> 04:42:44,970
Oh my god!

6662
04:42:44,990 --> 04:42:49,490
But yeah, huge shout out to Sonic for watching me play Sonic the Hedgehog.

6663
04:42:49,490 --> 04:42:50,990
The murder of Sonic the Hedgehog.

6664
04:42:51,130 --> 04:42:51,810
I had a lot of fun!

6665
04:42:51,970 --> 04:42:52,690
I had a lot of fun!

6666
04:42:53,190 --> 04:42:55,550
The artwork was like super fucking cute too.

6667
04:42:55,750 --> 04:42:56,270
And...

6668
04:42:56,850 --> 04:42:59,890
It was just fun to like do an April Fool's stream.

6669
04:43:00,410 --> 04:43:03,050
It might not be like super elaborate and I was just a tomato.

6670
04:43:03,270 --> 04:43:03,790
But...

6671
04:43:05,090 --> 04:43:08,830
I hope you guys had a fun time watching this with me.

6672
04:43:08,870 --> 04:43:10,050
Is there an after credits scene?

6673
04:43:10,150 --> 04:43:10,670
There is?

6674
04:43:11,150 --> 04:43:12,330
Okay, we'll stay guys.

6675
04:43:12,670 --> 04:43:13,110
Apparently...

6676
04:43:13,110 --> 04:43:14,090
I don't know.

6677
04:43:14,110 --> 04:43:15,030
I might have got one guide.

6678
04:43:15,210 --> 04:43:15,870
I don't know.

6679
04:43:16,030 --> 04:43:16,490
I could have...

6680
04:43:16,490 --> 04:43:18,050
I could easily get one guide.

6681
04:43:18,390 --> 04:43:18,730
Kaz!

6682
04:43:18,770 --> 04:43:19,670
Thank you for the super chat.

6683
04:43:19,730 --> 04:43:20,010
Thank you.

6684
04:43:20,030 --> 04:43:20,590
Thank you.

6685
04:43:20,790 --> 04:43:25,910
The biggest prank was how conductor mama converted me to the Sonic fan of I understand now.

6686
04:43:25,990 --> 04:43:27,830
Thank you for the super chat.

6687
04:43:28,010 --> 04:43:28,830
Thank you.

6688
04:43:28,830 --> 04:43:29,450
Thank you.

6689
04:43:29,550 --> 04:43:30,510
I'm just saying.

6690
04:43:30,690 --> 04:43:33,510
I understand why the conductor chose...

6691
04:43:33,510 --> 04:43:36,290
chose the land wife over train wife.

6692
04:43:36,530 --> 04:43:37,950
I understand now.

6693
04:43:40,130 --> 04:43:41,750
That's so fucked up.

6694
04:43:41,830 --> 04:43:42,570
The train...

6695
04:43:42,570 --> 04:43:50,910
The train wife was like putting their entire soul into like how much they love conductor as a...

6696
04:43:50,910 --> 04:43:51,510
as a friend.

6697
04:43:51,690 --> 04:43:53,650
As a really good roommates, you know?

6698
04:43:53,810 --> 04:43:57,290
And then the conductor was like, oh my god, real wife.

6699
04:43:57,430 --> 04:43:58,390
Let me tell you about this.

6700
04:43:58,770 --> 04:44:00,110
Oh my god, real wife.

6701
04:44:00,150 --> 04:44:01,470
It was such a funny day.

6702
04:44:06,390 --> 04:44:08,270
I'm just like, what?

6703
04:44:08,410 --> 04:44:10,350
That was such a funny day.

6704
04:44:10,490 --> 04:44:11,330
Real wife.

6705
04:44:11,510 --> 04:44:12,350
Oh my god.

6706
04:44:12,530 --> 04:44:13,030
Ha ha ha.

6707
04:44:16,010 --> 04:44:17,030
Poor train.

6708
04:44:17,390 --> 04:44:19,030
Poor fucking train.

6709
04:44:22,470 --> 04:44:24,810
So someone was like, I'd make the same choice.

6710
04:44:26,990 --> 04:44:31,170
It was so fun.

6711
04:44:31,590 --> 04:44:34,210
Shout out to America.

6712
04:44:34,390 --> 04:44:35,910
The Sega team in America.

6713
04:44:35,910 --> 04:44:36,730
For making this.

6714
04:44:36,970 --> 04:44:40,590
I also thought it was made by the JP team.

6715
04:44:40,770 --> 04:44:48,090
So I'm glad the Sonic, the official Sonic channel actually fact checked me and was like...

6716
04:44:48,090 --> 04:44:50,850
I was like, no, it was actually America.

6717
04:44:51,110 --> 04:44:51,990
And I was like, oh my god.

6718
04:44:52,090 --> 04:44:53,230
Fuck yeah, America.

6719
04:44:54,110 --> 04:44:54,590
Yeah.

6720
04:44:56,030 --> 04:45:00,510
I like assumed it was Japan because they always go super all out when it comes...

6721
04:45:01,230 --> 04:45:03,590
When it comes to like April Fool's shit.

6722
04:45:03,750 --> 04:45:05,890
Because they are like super dedicated to it.

6723
04:45:05,910 --> 04:45:06,610
I don't...

6724
04:45:06,610 --> 04:45:08,310
I honestly, I'm like...

6725
04:45:08,310 --> 04:45:08,990
I got one guide.

6726
04:45:09,130 --> 04:45:10,070
There was no fucking...

6727
04:45:10,070 --> 04:45:10,610
I got one guide.

6728
04:45:10,670 --> 04:45:11,790
There was no extra credits scene.

6729
04:45:11,850 --> 04:45:12,550
I can't believe it.

6730
04:45:15,170 --> 04:45:17,630
I got fucking one guide as always.

6731
04:45:17,950 --> 04:45:19,170
God damn it.

6732
04:45:20,150 --> 04:45:20,590
Um...

6733
04:45:21,470 --> 04:45:21,910
Anyway.

6734
04:45:22,510 --> 04:45:22,950
Anyway.

6735
04:45:23,110 --> 04:45:24,730
I had a great time with everybody.

6736
04:45:25,070 --> 04:45:26,750
I am gonna call it a day tomorrow.

6737
04:45:26,910 --> 04:45:27,350
I...

6738
04:45:27,350 --> 04:45:29,130
Sadly for those who didn't read Twitter.

6739
04:45:29,390 --> 04:45:31,890
I will be canceling tomorrow's stream.

6740
04:45:32,510 --> 04:45:32,950
Um...

6741
04:45:32,950 --> 04:45:34,350
Because I will be like...

6742
04:45:34,350 --> 04:45:35,830
I want to be like working and stuff.

6743
04:45:35,830 --> 04:45:36,690
So tomorrow to...

6744
04:45:36,690 --> 04:45:37,830
Because um...

6745
04:45:37,830 --> 04:45:38,650
Um...

6746
04:45:38,650 --> 04:45:39,070
Uh...

6747
04:45:39,070 --> 04:45:39,790
There's been...

6748
04:45:39,790 --> 04:45:40,910
I need to like stabilize.

6749
04:45:41,090 --> 04:45:43,770
I've been going way too fast in my career.

6750
04:45:44,430 --> 04:45:58,910
So tomorrow I will be like working on stabilizing myself and making sure to like look through everything to make sure that like restructuring how things are done professionally behind the scenes.

6751
04:46:00,010 --> 04:46:02,970
So like we don't like miss out on things.

6752
04:46:02,970 --> 04:46:06,070
So that's why tomorrow there will not be a stream tomorrow.

6753
04:46:06,790 --> 04:46:07,190
Um...

6754
04:46:07,190 --> 04:46:09,070
I'll pin that on the...

6755
04:46:09,070 --> 04:46:09,470
Uh...

6756
04:46:09,470 --> 04:46:10,690
On the schedule waiting room.

6757
04:46:10,770 --> 04:46:12,130
So like if people were like where's the stream?

6758
04:46:12,270 --> 04:46:14,110
And then they look at the schedule they'll be like there's no stream.

6759
04:46:14,630 --> 04:46:15,030
Um...

6760
04:46:15,030 --> 04:46:15,790
But yes everybody.

6761
04:46:15,970 --> 04:46:16,950
I hope you guys had a great time.

6762
04:46:17,030 --> 04:46:20,150
And I hope you guys had a great April Fool's with everybody that's been doing April Fool's stuff.

6763
04:46:20,410 --> 04:46:20,810
Um...

6764
04:46:20,810 --> 04:46:22,150
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

6765
04:46:22,270 --> 04:46:24,390
As always everybody stay hydrated.

6766
04:46:25,170 --> 04:46:25,810
Posture check.

6767
04:46:25,990 --> 04:46:28,350
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6768
04:46:28,510 --> 04:46:30,610
And if you stay up for me head to bed.

6769
04:46:30,770 --> 04:46:31,970
Cause you deserve it.

6770
04:46:31,970 --> 04:46:33,270

6771
04:46:33,710 --> 04:46:35,790
