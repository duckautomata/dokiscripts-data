1
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,650
Woohoo!

2
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,310
Meow!

3
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,690
Nya.

4
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,810
Are these my new owners?

5
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,410
Nya.

6
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,150
Hello.

7
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,370
Nya.

8
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,310
Nya.

9
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,870
Sorry.

10
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,050
Nya.

11
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,630
My name is Doki.

12
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,130
Will you adopt me, please?

13
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,290
Nyao.

14
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,250
My owners abandoned me.

15
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,590
And I need a new home to live.

16
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,590
Will you please adopt me?

17
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,930
Nyao.

18
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,390
I am Doki.

19
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,590
I have three rules.

20
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,280
Rule number one.

21
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,050
You need to buy me lots of treats and toys, or I die.

22
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,010
Rule number two.

23
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,770
I get to have all the fishes in the world every day, or I die.

24
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,290
And rule number three.

25
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,650
Wait, what was my rule number three?

26
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,310
I don't...

27
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,910
I don't remember what I wrote on the paper.

28
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,170
Oh!

29
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,710
I need the softest beds.

30
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,090
The softest and biggest beds.

31
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,230
Or I die.

32
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,390
My sickness is very serious.

33
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,130
If you miss out on one day...

34
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:02,850
I die.

35
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,830
So will you adopt me, please?

36
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,610
Nyao.

37
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,970
Oh yeah, rule number...

38
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,630
Sorry, I add one more rule.

39
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,770
I'm a very demanding cat.

40
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,390
Rule number four.

41
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,830
If...

42
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,390
If you put me outside...

43
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,890
And make me touch grass...

44
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,370
I die.

45
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,790
So will you adopt me, please?

46
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,570
Nyao.

47
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,870
I am a dog kitty.

48
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,830
Look at my ears go.

49
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,450
Up, down.

50
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,430
Up, down.

51
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,810
Up, down.

52
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:04,770
Nyao.

53
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,230
Oh, you wanna see my fish?

54
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,690
Let me get my fish real quick.

55
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,490
Give me a sec.

56
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,930
Wait, let me show you my fish.

57
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,190
Give me a sec.

58
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,230
I grab the fish.

59
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,550
There's a lot of stuff in...

60
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,930
There's only... Actually, there's not a lot of stuff in this box.

61
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,730
There's like...

62
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,450
Like one thing in this box.

63
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,530
This is my fish.

64
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,490
Give me a sec.

65
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,750
You like my fish?

66
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,310
This is my personal fish.

67
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,030
But you gotta refill it.

68
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,910
Tomorrow or I die.

69
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,910
Alright, let me push my fish away.

70
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,610
Unless you're gonna refill my fish right now.

71
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,390
Let me put it away.

72
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:53,850
Yes!

73
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,600
I am your little...

74
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,850
Wait, not little.

75
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,710
Actually, this box is pretty big.

76
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,570
Not gonna lie.

77
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,550
I am your big kitty.

78
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,310
I am.

79
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,730
I am your big kitty.

80
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,550
Dog kitty.

81
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,770
Anyway, so...

82
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,850
Happy April Fools, everybody!

83
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,810
Yes, Dogekitty is here.

84
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,850
Another addition to the Dogeverse.

85
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,630
I am Dogekitty.

86
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,350
It's different from Dogefield.

87
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,950
I am a lot different from Dogefield, as you see.

88
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,730
Because I...

89
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,690
I would say I'm less handsome than Dogefield.

90
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,510
But I still think people would like me.

91
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,290
But...

92
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,890
One of the best things...

93
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,270
One of the reasons why...

94
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,890
I appear to you today...

95
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,890
Is so I could do...

96
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,090
I can do this.

97
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,050
Greatest form.

98
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,510
I'm not a menace!

99
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,050
Did you not read the letters, dragons?

100
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,010
Did you not read the letter?

101
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,250
It says...

102
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,110
It says...

103
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,670
I am...

104
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,410
Wait, what did...

105
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,370
What's the letter say?

106
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,170
I don't remember.

107
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,470
I wrote it like...

108
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,110
I mean, not me.

109
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,950
I didn't write it.

110
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,530
My previous owners that abandoned me wrote it.

111
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,790
I'm not a stray cat.

112
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,950
I was...

113
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,970
I was not a stray street cat.

114
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,250
I swear to God.

115
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,450
I did not come up with this scam so I can be pampered at home.

116
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,190
And be a nice house...

117
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,810
And be a spoiled house cat.

118
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,590
I swear to...

119
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,090
I had previous owners.

120
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:09,870
I swear.

121
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,510
I swear I did.

122
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,850
That letter was written by my previous owner.

123
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,770
And I am not a stray cat.

124
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,750
Anyway...

125
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,330
So on that letter that my previous owner wrote...

126
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,210
And I didn't write because...

127
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,370
I'm not trying to scam my way into your nice lovely home, sir.

128
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,190
It's not that I saw that you had like...

129
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,110
Lots of...

130
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,310
Lots of food inside.

131
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,310
And you had like air conditioning and heat.

132
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,950
And you had like...

133
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,350
I saw all that lasagna and fish in there.

134
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,630
And the biggest bed...

135
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,570
Softest bed possible.

136
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,090
It's not that.

137
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,670
It's not that.

138
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,790
I had all of those before in my previous home.

139
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,450
Yes, yes, yes.

140
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,210
I had all of that over there too.

141
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,830
It's just that, you know...

142
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,790
My previous owners...

143
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,610
They had to...

144
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,030
They had to move, you know?

145
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,230
And so like...

146
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,150
They were like...

147
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,010
Oh my god.

148
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,550
These...

149
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,870
These new owners are gonna take real good care...

150
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,970
Of my...

151
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,070
Of my old kitty.

152
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,110
And...

153
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,430
Yeah.

154
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,230
Yeah.

155
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,070
No tixie-baxies.

156
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,010
Anyway...

157
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,790
Anyway, my letter.

158
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,670
In my letter...

159
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,770
It says...

160
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,310
It says...

161
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:23,730
She's...

162
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,670
A very good...

163
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,450
Not cause trouble.

164
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,710
That's me.

165
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,610
I not cause trouble.

166
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,470
That's me.

167
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,110
I no cause trouble.

168
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,350
I'm a very good kitty.

169
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,650
After all, my name is Doe Kitty.

170
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,470
How could...

171
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,470
Would this face lie to you?

172
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,710
Look at that.

173
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,010
Look at this.

174
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,730
Come on!

175
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,930
Oh yes.

176
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,850
Oh yes.

177
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,050
Because...

178
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,790
I can make all sorts of...

179
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,910
All sorts of faces.

180
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,370
Wait.

181
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,770
I don't remember...

182
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,350
I don't remember what kind.

183
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,770
But...

184
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,850
My tail...

185
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,730
My tail is back down.

186
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,070
Sorry.

187
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,370
What...

188
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,450
What can I do again?

189
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,390
I don't remember.

190
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:31,990
Oh.

191
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,490
Oh.

192
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:32,890
No.

193
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,190
Wait.

194
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,410
Wait.

195
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:33,690
Wait.

196
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,710
Wait.

197
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,350
Wait.

198
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,090
Wait.

199
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,430
Wait.

200
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,330
You didn't see that.

201
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,630
You didn't see that, guys.

202
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,930
You didn't see that.

203
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,010
There's the doom.

204
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,450
The doom.

205
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,190
And then...

206
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,970
My little bearish...

207
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,370
Meow.

208
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,330
I'm a sleepy kitty.

209
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,910
I'm a really tired sleepy kitty.

210
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,630
And...

211
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,670
But I can be your smart cat too.

212
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,570
I can be your very, very smart cat.

213
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,590
Wow!

214
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,870
Or I can be your dead inside cat.

215
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,630
Please, I'm dying.

216
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,110
I didn't have my new toy today.

217
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,210
Please, Dragoon.

218
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,310
You read the rules.

219
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,110
You said...

220
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,210
You said you'd give me a new toy and a new treat every day.

221
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,950
And now I'm...

222
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,090
And now you're trying to skip today?

223
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,890
I'm dying now.

224
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,710
Quick, somebody give her a toy!

225
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,630
You want me to go outside?

226
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,110
Do you not...

227
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,650
Do you not want me?

228
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,630
And then, I can also...

229
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,700
I can also wear...

230
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,810
I found this on the street.

231
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,970
I mean, not the street.

232
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,250
If I go outside, I die.

233
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,750
That's why I was in the box, guys.

234
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,910
I never spend my life outside in the streets.

235
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,890
I've always been a house cat.

236
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,450
I know what it's like to be a house cat.

237
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,450
This was already...

238
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,910
This was already in my box.

239
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,230
It was in my old home.

240
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,930
Right there.

241
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,890
And then, I also have...

242
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,570
My fish.

243
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,610
My fish that was also in my box that I never went outside for.

244
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,330
And then...

245
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,170
And I can take off my jacket.

246
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,850
And...

247
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,790
That's just...

248
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,590
You didn't see that.

249
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,070
And then...

250
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,130
And then...

251
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,190
And I'm like...

252
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,050
Go baby, go outside, please.

253
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,790
Please.

254
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,570
Please.

255
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,330
I'll die.

256
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,290
And I'm like...

257
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,790
Oh my God.

258
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,810
Fish?

259
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,710
For me?

260
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,290
But then, also...

261
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,470
Wait.

262
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,730
But also, I also have...

263
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,430
I also have some...

264
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,610
Okay, wait.

265
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,830
I forgot to put this on.

266
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,520
Is that money?

267
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,860
Oh my God.

268
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Super chat?

269
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,100
Shiny super chat.

270
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:55,660
Oh.

271
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,720
Wow.

272
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,840
Wow.

273
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,140
Wow.

274
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,160
Wait, I got something even better.

275
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,140
Oh my gosh, wait.

276
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:03,740
No!

277
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,420
I can't type words right now, because I...

278
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,240
Okay, no, I can.

279
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,000
Okay.

280
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,860
I can type words.

281
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,700
I forgot.

282
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,820
I have these by somewhere else.

283
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,620
Wait, wait, let me...

284
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,860
I got something even better though.

285
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,580
Okay, oh, this one.

286
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,820
I have something even better for you guys to show.

287
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,780
Alright, wait.

288
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,780
I found this in my box.

289
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,540
Give me a sec.

290
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,760
It was in my box.

291
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,140
Where's the picture?

292
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,230
Oh.

293
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,490
Oh.

294
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,090
What?

295
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,150
What is that?

296
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,690
Why does it move around so much?

297
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,730
Oh my God!

298
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,990
Also...

299
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,070
That trip in that box was so much.

300
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,530
Ah!

301
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,010
Why didn't you put me down gently, Jackals?

302
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,290
And then...

303
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,030
Please don't make me go outside.

304
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,410
Please.

305
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,670
I'm allergic to grass.

306
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,710
Please.

307
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,390
I swear, I would not lie.

308
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm allergic to grass.

309
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,710
No, no.

310
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,090
I'll only take vet visits if it's in-house.

311
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,930
If I go outside, I die.

312
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,250
Please.

313
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,390
If I go outside, I'll die.

314
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,730
And then...

315
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,510
Also, I hope it's okay if I bring my friend along too.

316
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,250
My little buddy.

317
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,310
I have my own pet as well.

318
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,650
Here's dad.

319
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,350
It's a two-for-one!

320
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,710
You get a twofer!

321
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,810
Look at that!

322
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,290
That's my pet.

323
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,290
So, yes.

324
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,010
I also have my own pet.

325
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,750
Here's Jokey Amber Doge.

326
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,170
So, he lives with us too now.

327
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,350
So, we have a two-for-one deal as well.

328
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,330
So, yeah.

329
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,170
Anyway, thank you for...

330
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,570
Thank you for welcoming me to your home, Dragons.

331
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,410
I'm gonna love spending my days here.

332
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,690
Forever.

333
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,450
And ever.

334
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,090
And ever.

335
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,470
Until you die.

336
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,020
Yes, that is my...

337
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,040
It is my pet-pet.

338
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,880
Just like in Neopets.

339
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,500
It's my pet-pet.

340
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,080
Alright.

341
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,940
Oh!

342
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,760
Oh, you have a room?

343
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,260
Oh, it's my room now?

344
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,580
Dragons?

345
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,260
You shouldn't have!

346
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,040
Really?

347
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,120
Oh my god.

348
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,220
Oh, thank you so much for giving me...

349
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,360
Giving me your room.

350
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,000
I really appreciate...

351
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,260
Oh!

352
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,900
You...

353
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,740
Oh my gosh.

354
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,240
Don't worry.

355
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,880
I already called people over in advance to decorate it to my liking while you were unpacking my box.

356
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
So don't worry.

357
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,620
They're already done with the box already.

358
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,300
So, you wanna check my room out now?

359
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,040
Come on!

360
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,760
Join me!

361
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,460
Wow!

362
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,180
Oh my god!

363
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,780
They worked really fast.

364
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,100
It's crazy that this used to be your room.

365
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,340
That's crazy.

366
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,280
Well, now it's my room.

367
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,660
How else am I gonna...

368
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,380
How else am I gonna like...

369
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,600
You want me to be bored?

370
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,900
You want me to die?

371
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,880
You read the rules.

372
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,540
You opened the package.

373
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,080
So, this is your fate now.

374
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,620
No, no, no.

375
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,140
It's my room now.

376
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,300
Oh yeah, we added like several floors.

378
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,620
If you live in like a house, we added several floors to your house.

379
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,800
So now it's a villa.

380
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,760
Now it's a little apartment building.

381
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,040
Welcome!

382
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,060
I basically raised your property value, dragons.

383
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,500
Can you really say no to me?

384
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,420
You really...

385
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,200
Can you really say no to this face?

386
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,670
Oh, with what money?

387
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,710
Don't worry.

388
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,190
I took several loans off of your name.

389
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,670
So, I hope you appreciate.

390
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,990
Don't worry, don't worry.

391
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,830
It's a good investment.

392
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,910
It's a good investment.

393
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,270
So, your credit's gonna be super fine, guys.

394
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,870
Your credit's gonna be okay.

395
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,590
But I took some loans under your name before my box got here.

396
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,330
Because I knew you would say yes anyway.

397
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,110
Your credit score is gonna be A-okay.

398
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,670
Trust me, guys.

399
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,750
Trust me.

400
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,450
But yes.

401
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,350
I love my new room.

402
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,850
Thank you so much, dragons.

403
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,250
I really love my new room that you've given me.

404
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,530
It's really nice.

405
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,630
I love how they decorated it and everything, too.

406
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,190
Oh my gosh.

407
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,170
But yes.

408
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,470
Oh my gosh, I love how my ears...

409
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,310
My ears...

410
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,990
Go up.

411
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,390
Down.

412
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,710
Up.

413
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,630
And then I can do...

414
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,250
I also have four ears, so I can hear better.

415
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,290
So I can hear you better.

416
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,510
So, don't try anything funny.

417
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,330
Don't try anything silly.

418
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,490
Oh yes, oh yes.

419
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,490
Since we're here, I believe...

420
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,450
I believe you guys want one thing and it's photo time.

421
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,790
Is it photo time or do I...

422
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,890
Or for April Fools, I just...

423
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,230
The greatest joke of all time.

424
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,970
There's no photo shoot.

425
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,510
Do I do that to you guys?

426
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,710
Do I actually...

427
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,490
That is the greatest joke...

428
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,690
That is the greatest prank of all time.

429
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,750
No photo shoot for...

430
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,890
For Dogekitty.

431
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,930
Please, please, please.

432
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,750
No photos.

433
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,910
No photos.

434
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,650
Not for...

435
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,850
No photos, please.

436
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,030
Please, respect my privacy.

437
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,450
Respect Dogekitty's privacy.

438
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,550
The paparazzi, please.

439
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,770
Stop, no.

440
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,050
Stop following me.

441
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:03,110
Stop following me.

442
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,590
Please, if you wish to...

443
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,790
If you wish to access the photos...

444
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,150
Please visit my own...

445
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,890
OnlyCat's website.

446
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,630
OnlyCat slash Dogekitty.

447
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,810
To receive exclusive cat photos.

448
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,910
For...

449
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,810
Cause it's not for free.

450
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,810
Not the OnlyCat.

451
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,410
No!

452
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,510
Yes.

453
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,250
Okay, so...

454
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,050
All I'm gonna say...

455
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,730
Is that, by the way...

456
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,210
I...

457
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,570
I hate the CRA.

458
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,070
But now that I'm doing...

459
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,510
But like, how could I hate the CRA...

460
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,550
If I'm a cat?

461
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,470
I'm a...

462
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,750
I don't have to...

463
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,070
Cats don't have to worry about taxes.

464
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,150
Cats don't have to worry about paying rent.

465
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,150
I just chose a home and now I live here.

466
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,870
Now I live here and you pay the taxes.

467
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,350
And I can just live.

468
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,250
Cats don't have to worry about real life adult issues.

469
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,320
Cats can just go...

470
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,150
And then I get everything I want.

471
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,370
Alright,

472
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,240
alright, alright.

473
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,780
How much do you...

474
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,000
How badly do you want to photoshoot dragons?

475
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,360
How badly do you want it?

476
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,640
Is this what you guys are right now?

477
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,680
No photos.

478
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,140
No photos.

479
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,920
No photos.

480
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,640
Yeah.

481
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,600
Okay, okay.

482
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,360
Maybe...

483
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,300
Maybe one photo.

484
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,360
Okay, done.

485
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,180
April Fools!

486
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
April Fools!

487
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,020
April Fools!

488
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,840
Okay,

489
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,710
okay, okay.

490
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,570
I'll give you guys a photoshoot.

491
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,570
Whoa.

492
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,290
Yeah?

493
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,530
I actually put my tail down because, you know, it's part of my body.

494
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,930
Uh, let me see.

495
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,550
Well, now the tail is down.

496
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,810
But it doesn't have to be.

497
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,030
And then I can... my tail can go super fast.

498
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,690
Like, wow!

499
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,910
I get the zoomies.

500
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,050
Oh my...

501
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,330
And then I'll be like...

502
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:20,470
Huh?

503
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,130
Oh my God.

504
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,210
Whoa!

505
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,390
I get the little zoomies.

506
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,150
I also put my tail down.

507
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,770
But you guys can't really see where it...

508
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,870
My tail is like down there.

509
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,390
But I'll put it up here for better photos.

510
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,150
And then I can...

511
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,910
Keep on that toggle.

512
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,090
That entices me a little bit more.

513
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,890
My dignity is on the line.

514
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,110
Can you...

515
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,470
Can you...

516
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,810
Can you buy my dignity?

517
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,810
We'll see there.

518
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,110
Alright, thank you for the superchat.

519
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:56,770
Thank you.

520
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,570
Thank you.

521
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,630
Oh shit!

522
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,670
Oh, that's a...

523
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,590
That's like a freebie.

524
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,210
Okay, there.

525
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:04,770
Yeah.

526
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,910
Do the zero point...

527
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,350
Yeah, do the 0.00 speed there.

528
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,670
Alright, what else?

529
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,150
Oh, there's like...

530
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,990
And then...

531
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,490
I'm so tired.

532
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,650
I'm so tired.

533
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,730
Tired kitty.

534
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,330
Tired kitty.

535
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,110
I love buying your dignity.

536
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:40,530
Okay.

537
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,430
Okay, I'll do it later.

538
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,630
I'll do it later.

539
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,790
But I'm also a smart kitty too.

540
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,580
I'm a smart kitty.

541
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:52,860
Yeah.

542
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,320
I'm business cat.

543
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,760
Who let this cat in my office?

544
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,720
And then I go like...

545
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,180
I like clicking and smack things down.

546
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,980
I smack things down like the desk and stuff.

547
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,040
But I can be a dead inside kitty.

548
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,180
Oh, dead inside kitty.

549
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,040
And...

550
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,100
Very dead inside kitty.

551
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,020
Another day, another dollar.

552
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,280
Another...

553
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,280
And then I also have...

554
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,380
I have my glasses that was always inside my box and I didn't find on the street because I'm not a straight kitty.

555
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,560
I'm a good kitty.

556
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,280
And then I also have...

557
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,260
My fish.

558
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,320
My little fish buddy.

559
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,280
Oh wait, I can do...

560
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,880
You know, that cat may may.

561
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,320
And I also can take off my jacket.

562
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,640
And then...

563
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,060
Oh, no, we don't want that.

564
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,480
I don't want to be a...

565
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,400
It's all just guy build.

566
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,510
And then...

567
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:39,850
Sad.

568
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,670
Very sad.

569
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,110
Meow.

570
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,510
Meow.

571
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,650
Meow.

572
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,770
Wow, is that fish?

573
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,210
Fish!

574
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,130
And then...

575
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,550
Big fish!

576
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,250
Shiny?

577
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,810
Shiny?

578
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,650
And then...

579
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,510
Dizzy.

580
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,610
I'm so dizzy.

581
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,970
And then...

582
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,970
The grass touched me.

583
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,890
The grass touched me.

584
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,530
Oh my god.

585
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,650
A piece of grass touched me.

586
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,410
I need a doctor.

587
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,410
I need a doctor.

588
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,090
Someone, please.

589
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,590
Get the vet.

590
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,970
Oh, and then there's...

591
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,990
There's dad, but he's cut up a little bit.

592
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,350
So, like...

593
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,170
I could fix this, but I'm a little...

594
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,150
Okay, I could fix...

595
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,070
I should fix this.

596
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,390
I was like...

597
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,130
I could fix this, or I don't.

598
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,210
I fixed it.

599
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,770
Look, see?

600
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,790
He's okay now.

601
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,770
Yeah!

602
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,950
And then...

603
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,710
Wait, okay.

604
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,390
Alright.

605
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,330
Finally.

606
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,410
You freaks all wanted...

607
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,430
I think it was like this.

608
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,330
Oh, wait, no.

609
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:32,930
It's this.

610
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,270
This.

611
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:36,870
It's this.

612
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,690
Yeah.

613
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,370
Okay.

614
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,330
Okay.

615
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,210
Alright.

616
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,370
Off it goes.

617
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,130
Off it...

618
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:54,830
Okay, wait, wait.

619
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,670
Alright.

620
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,170
Alright, there we go.

621
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,850
That's good enough.

622
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,590
That's good enough.

623
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,470
That should be...

624
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,950
That should be good enough.

625
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,950
Guys, stop!

626
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,750
Stop!

627
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,590
No cameras!

628
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,850
No cameras!

629
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,830
Please!

630
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,930
It was the last one!

631
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,510
Judgment!

632
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,990
I got into the catnip!

633
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,550
Okay?

634
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:12,790
Please!

635
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,870
No cameras!

636
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,290
Don't get me got into some catnip!

637
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,390
It violated the terms of services!

638
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,610
Get out!

639
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,870
The fish?

640
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,090
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

641
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,050
Alright.

642
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:29,770
Alright.

643
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,090
Fish.

644
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,710
I love fish.

645
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,610
Oh my god, I fucking love fish.

646
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,250
Oh my god.

647
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,750
This fish is so fucking good.

648
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,730
Man, I love...

649
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,570
I fucking love fish.

650
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,810
Let me get fish a little.

651
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,730
Bro, I just really, really love fish.

652
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:22,810
What can I say?

653
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,030
Alright,

654
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,430
photoshoot.

655
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,150
Photoshoot's over, guys.

656
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,650
Back to my room.

657
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,990
But yes!

658
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,190
Did you guys like my little April Fools?

659
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,330
This is real, though.

660
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:45,970
This is canon.

661
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,310
It's like, April Fools is over.

662
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,570
I snap and Doughkitty's gone forever.

663
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,670
This is the last time you've ever seen Doughkitty.

664
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,450
She's just gone forever.

665
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,230
Don't worry, Doughkitty's forever.

666
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,490
So, I'll still be here, guys!

667
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,390
You saw the letter, right?

668
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,650
I mean, like, I'll still be here.

669
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,090
Like, you guys agreed to the letter.

670
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,950
And I already put your...

671
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,930
Used your credit to get several loans to make this place.

672
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,410
So, you know.

673
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,970
I don't wanna waste the money.

674
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,270
Don't you remember?

675
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,530
The contract you agreed to?

676
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,390
To adopting Doughkitty?

677
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,430
Don't worry.

678
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,570
I didn't write this, by the way.

679
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,470
I definitely didn't write this.

680
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,730
I am not a stray cat that scammed my way into your home.

681
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:45,990
I would never.

682
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,270
I have always been a nice, pampered, spoiled house kitty.

683
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,230
But anyway, this is what my previous owner wrote to you.

684
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,590
Which you agreed and signed.

685
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,410
Sign it.

686
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,750
Don't worry.

687
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,410
No, you know the bottom, right?

688
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,730
That little paw print?

689
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,530
That's your signature right there.

690
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,330
Okay, so I'll read it for you guys.

691
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,850
That you legally agreed to.

692
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,330
Hello, dragons.

693
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,170
Please, take care of this kitty.

694
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,430
That's me.

695
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,230
I'm the kitty.

696
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:15,120
That's...

697
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,170
That's me.

698
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,890
That's me.

699
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,490
She is very good.

700
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,510
Not cause trouble.

701
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,810
That's me.

702
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,090
Please feed lots of fish.

703
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,510
Or she die.

704
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,270
That's also me.

705
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,110
Can only sleep in softest bed.

706
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,530
Or she die.

707
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,910
Please buy her treats and toys.

708
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,470
Every day.

709
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,210
Or she die.

710
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,570
It's a very sad disease.

711
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,690
Thank you.

712
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,250
Yeah, it's...

713
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,910
There's no cure for it.

714
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,890
So like, if you miss out...

715
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,510
I forgot...

716
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,350
There's an addendum in there.

717
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,970
There's an additional rule in there.

718
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,670
Is that please don't let outside.

719
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,470
Or she die.

720
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,530
My owner forgot to write that rule down.

721
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:10,430
But don't worry.

722
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,110
You're lucky I'm a talking cat.

723
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,870
So I'm just like Meowth.

724
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,250
Meow.

725
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,470
Meow.

726
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,110
And like, I can tell you that...

727
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,690
If you let me outside.

728
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,390
Or if grass touches me.

729
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,130
I also die.

730
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:22,970
So don't worry.

731
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:23,510
Don't worry.

732
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,150
I help you avoid like...

733
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,830
Expensive medical vet bills.

734
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,890
By telling you that.

735
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:35,670
Anyway.

736
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,250
But yes.

737
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,330
It's a very serious.

738
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,690
Very serious.

739
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,290
Very...

740
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,630
There's no cure for this disease that I have.

741
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,810
But like, other than that.

742
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,970
You just follow...

743
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,810
Follow all of these very easy simple rules.

744
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,110
And then...

745
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,430
You have yourself a cat.

746
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,180
JL.

747
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,580
Thank you for the super chat.

748
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,620
Thank you.

749
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,680
Hey Doge Kitty.

750
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,300
Can I get a belated birth meow wish?

751
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,200
Of course.

752
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Happy birthday to you.

753
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,000
Happy birthday to you.

754
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,700
Happy birthday dear JL.

755
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,920
Happy birthday to you.

756
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,880
Yay.

757
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,380
Happy birthday.

758
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,660
Wow.

759
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,520
It's happy...

760
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,680
Happy April 1st.

761
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,380
I mean...

762
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,640
April 1st.

763
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,520
I...

764
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,940
Doge Kitty came into being.

765
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,840
That's me.

766
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,700
I'm Doge Kitty.

767
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,520
I came into being as a mere thought.

768
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,400
A month ago.

769
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,660
And now I'm here.

770
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,040
Not even a month ago.

771
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,180
I think like two...

772
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,220
Two and a half weeks ago.

773
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,280
And now...

774
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,360
And then I was born.

775
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,640
And now I'm part of the Dogeverse.

776
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,900
Pikachu.

777
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,600
Thank you for the Akasupa.

778
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,500
Thank you.

779
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,380
Thank you.

780
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,380
Can we please...

781
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,640
Okay.

782
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:09,920
Okay.

783
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,140
I'll give you the long neck again.

784
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,280
I think it was this.

785
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,740
No, it wasn't.

786
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,500
It was this.

787
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:14,860
Wait.

788
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,420
No, it wasn't.

789
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,860
It was this.

790
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,800
There we go.

791
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,660
There we go.

792
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,920
This is...

793
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,700
I fight like giraffes.

794
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,900
You know like how giraffes...

795
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,060
Giraffes, they like bash each other.

796
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,080
I'm a long cat.

797
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,420
Long cat.

798
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,140
Wow.

799
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,500
Long cat.

800
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,400
You know how like when you pick up a cat and they're longer than they are?

801
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,220
This is what happens when you pick me up.

802
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,080
My neck just...

803
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,280
My neck expands when you pick me up.

804
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,420
Now you know...

805
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,640
Now you guys know why I didn't start the stream right away.

806
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,960
Because I knew that like you guys...

807
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,620
Wouldn't want to miss it out.

808
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
Don't say I never give you a...

809
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,740
It was like...

810
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,620
Doki, we're so starving.

811
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,600
Where's the fan service, Doki?

812
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,020
I'm gonna die, please.

813
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,420
I'm so thirsty.

814
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,600
Don't say I never give you nothing.

815
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,100
With a little bit of debt, here you go.

816
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,300
Anyway, but that's why, that's why.

817
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,280
Oh yeah, I forgot.

818
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,840
I mean, there's not really much difference with the full bot.

819
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,580
Okay, give me a sec.

820
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,860
Let me go back to the green screen.

821
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,860
I gotta...

822
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,700
Disappear!

823
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,940
Where did the cat go?

824
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,900
Where did I go?

825
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:00,940
Okay, I need to...

826
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,140
Alright.

827
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,860
There's really nothing much different with...

828
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,340
I reappear!

829
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,040
There's really not much different with...

830
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,660
Okay, but I can put my tail down like this.

831
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,220
Which is what you don't see.

832
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,620
So I have my tail down like that.

833
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860
But I can...

834
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,140
My tail can go super fast.

835
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,180
And then...

836
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,800
But then I can make it go up.

837
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,540
When I get super excited.

838
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,180
Okay.

839
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,140
Alright.

840
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,140
I'm like super excited right now.

841
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,800
And then...

842
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,200
Like I said, there's not really much different.

843
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,120
I mean, I just have cat ears and a tail.

844
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:49,960
So...

845
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,020
And there's my tail.

846
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,220
Yeah, now I can go up.

847
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,080
Down.

848
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:04,620
Up.

849
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,100
Yeah, and then when I look this way.

850
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,140
And then...

851
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,020
I can make my tail go like that.

852
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,360
And like that.

853
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,220
Like that.

854
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,020
And then, I guess if you want...

855
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,860
Angry kitty.

856
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:30,290
Meow.

857
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,260
Meow.

858
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,260
Meow.

859
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,200
Wait, let me cough up a hairball.

860
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,060
Now you know why I lose at all of this.

861
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,960
Don't get it.

862
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,220
Don't get it.

863
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:01,620
No.

864
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:02,800
That's right.

865
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,920
On your couch too.

866
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,060
On your couch.

867
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,740
Not on my couch.

868
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:18,640
Oh yeah, here.

869
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,760
There's...

870
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,640
There's...

871
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,800
Aviator kitty.

872
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,660
No kitty.

873
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,860
Right there.

874
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,060
Someone get the...

875
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,220
Get the spray bottle.

876
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,020
Wait, wait, let me...

877
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,400
Where's the...

878
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,820
Wait, what's this?

879
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,620
Oh, this was dead inside.

880
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,080
Okay, wait.

881
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,260
You want the spray bottle?

882
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,980
Wait, I got you.

883
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,200
I got you.

884
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,820
What is this?

885
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,140
What?

886
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,140
Oh, there's dad.

887
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,340
Wait, there's gonna be like several emotions coming out.

888
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,780
Because I'm trying to type right now.

889
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,780
Okay.

890
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,760
What was Y again?

891
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,820
Oh, there it is.

892
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,180
Okay.

893
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,760
And then...

894
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:01,980
Okay.

895
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,440
Whoa!

896
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,160
I don't remember what all of my things are.

897
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,140
I don't rem...

898
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:07,720
Oh, there it is.

899
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,380
I fixed it.

900
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:08,980
Alright.

901
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,540
Let me grab it for you guys.

902
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,800
Real quick.

903
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:14,940
Alright.

904
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,660
It's not very intuitive how I did this.

905
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,100
It's definitely not very intuitive.

906
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,400
Not very smart of me.

907
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,820
Okay, we're...

908
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,540
Spray bottle.

909
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:28,620
Spraying.

910
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,780
Just for the photoshoot.

911
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,260
I'll do it for the photoshoot.

912
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,260
Alright.

913
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,440
Dive down.

914
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:42,940
No!

915
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,000
I gotta pay for this?

916
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,700
No way.

917
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,100
I'm not paying for shit.

918
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,340
I'm not paying for this.

919
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,340
It's a spray bottle.

920
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,340
It's a goddamn spray bottle.

921
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,140
Where the heck is the transparent...

922
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,580
Oh, there it is.

923
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,320
Wait.

924
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,720
Can I download this one?

925
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,700
Sorry, guys.

926
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,980
I'm trying to find a free...

927
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,200
A free spray bottle for us, guys.

928
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,100
It's a little...

929
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,040
Who would've thought?

930
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,500
This is very difficult to find.

931
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,320
Is there no transparent spray bottle?

932
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,380
I gotta...

933
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,140
I gotta pay to use a transparent spray bottle?

934
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
What the fuck?

935
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,040
Okay, I'll just use this.

936
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,400
This is free, right?

937
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,160
Guys, it wasn't free.

938
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,480
How could this be possible?

939
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,780
Oh, I found a free.

940
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,480
Don't worry.

941
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,140
I got it.

942
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,020
You wouldn't download a car, would you?

943
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,040
Okay, I'm gonna use this, guys.

944
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,980
But there is...

945
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,920
There is a watermark on...

946
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,500
Oh, no!

947
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,260
I can't!

948
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,960
They made it so I...

949
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,480
Oh, I can.

950
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:40,840
Okay.

951
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,820
I got this, guys.

952
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,380
Don't worry.

953
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,720
It does have a watermark, though.

954
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:55,430
Don't worry.

955
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,290
Ah!

956
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,660
Ah!

957
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,120
No!

958
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:07,690
Ah!

959
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,940
Ah!

960
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,080
No!

961
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,190
Oh, my God.

962
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,930
It's spraying watermarks on me!

963
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,770
No!

964
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,150
I won't be able to own my own image!

965
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,210
No!

966
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:44,710
No!

967
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,890
No!

968
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,050
Okay.

969
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,090
Okay.

970
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,450
That's the...

971
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,450
That's the spray bottle.

972
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,530
Your rights are that...

973
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:03,030
No!

974
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,890
You might be noticing something's missing on my head.

975
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:13,370
But that's cause I'm Doki.

976
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,870
I'm not Doki Bird.

977
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:16,610
I'm Doki.

978
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:17,910
Hello?

979
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,030
Ooh.

980
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:24,830
Yeah.

981
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:25,930
Yes.

982
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,070
Alright, photoshoot over again.

983
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:29,790
True.

984
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,550
We need the shock Doki reaction meme.

985
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,470
Wait, what is it?

986
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,130
Yeah, I don't have my feather.

987
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:44,850
Because I never had a feather.

988
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:45,490
What do you mean?

989
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:45,990
I'm Doki.

990
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:47,450
I'm...

991
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,410
I'm Doki.

992
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,110
Empty eyes.

993
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:51,770
What?

994
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,270
Alright, I'll give you that.

995
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:56,350
But you don't get the green screen.

996
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,250
That's right.

997
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,370
April fools.

998
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,210
Okay, I think...

999
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:02,650
Oh, shit.

1000
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:03,630
Okay, it's...

1001
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,090
Oh, my gosh.

1002
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,890
I keep getting confused which one is which.

1003
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:06,710
Okay, it's this.

1004
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:08,750
And...

1005
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,590
It's this and this.

1006
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,010
April fools, no green screen for you.

1007
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,810
Yeah.

1008
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,540
It's a nice little...

1009
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,810
Nice little...

1010
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,010
April fools day for all of you guys.

1011
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,190
I figured I wanted to do something more fun with you guys.

1012
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:48,450
Something...

1013
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:52,070
Something I can also use more in the future.

1014
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,350
If she evolves, she'll be Doki.

1015
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,210
Oh, for those who missed out.

1016
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,490
For those who missed out.

1017
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:03,210
I want to say a huge thank you to several people who helped me out with all of this.

1018
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:06,470
So, as always, the 3D animation was done by Ramen.

1019
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:10,450
The box was 3D modeled by SaltedFish.

1020
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,450
The box was drawn...

1021
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,370
First drawn digitally by Shio.

1022
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:19,510
Sorry, I didn't have all the credits written.

1023
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,210
But I will thank them in that post tweet.

1024
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:24,530
So...

1025
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,510
And...

1026
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,810
What else?

1027
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,170
What else?

1028
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,210
Celia, rigging everything.

1029
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,550
Helping making me my new skin suit move.

1030
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,150
Making Doki.

1031
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,230
And then my mama, Kamame.

1032
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,210
For drawing the...

1033
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,350
For designing the cat ears and the cat tail.

1034
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,770
Huge shout out to all of them.

1035
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,330
Always love working with all these people.

1036
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:46,370
To make all of this happen.

1037
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,130
And Hibi for helping me write my note.

1038
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,870
See, I told you, I didn't write the note.

1039
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,330
For those who missed out on the animation, let me show you guys the animation again.

1040
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,340
Oh my god, that's so cute.

1041
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,760
That is such a cute animation.

1042
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,340
Also, I think, honestly, this is definitely my favorite.

1043
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,160
This is like, one of the main reasons why I wanted to do this.

1044
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,860
This is honestly one of the main reasons why.

1045
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,580
Okay, I don't know, I just fucking love this meme.

1046
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,900
The spiritual successor to the last time I did this meme.

1047
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,720
But now, now I'm Doki.

1048
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,620
Now it makes more sense.

1049
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,540
As Doki.

1050
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,700
It's just...

1051
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,560
I tried to find a salad.

1052
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,780
But like, I couldn't find...

1053
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,700
They put too much salad in my salad.

1054
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,840
So like, pasta works too.

1055
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,620
Anyway, back to my desk.

1056
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,940
My...

1057
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,600
My room that you graciously gave me.

1058
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:37,920
But...

1059
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,220
I'm not gonna lie.

1060
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,260
I hope you guys enjoyed...

1061
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,980
My little...

1062
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,280
My little April Fools for all of you guys.

1063
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,640
It was a very, you know...

1064
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,420
Truly...

1065
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,440
Very, very, very short surprise.

1066
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,480
Didn't really have too much planned for it.

1067
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,880
But I still hope you guys enjoyed this little April Fools.

1068
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:56,780
Yeah.

1069
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,220
But I still wanna spend...

1070
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,140
I still wanna spend...

1071
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,780
Time with all of you guys.

1072
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,980
Right now.

1073
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,640
So I'll read through some Super Chats for now.

1074
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,640
Oh yeah.

1075
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,200
Also, I'll give you a life update.

1076
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,440
Before I start reading Super Chats.

1077
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,820
I went to bed at 7 in the morning.

1078
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:22,780
Today.

1079
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,460
Because I had to stay up.

1080
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,360
And call the CRA.

1081
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:27,980
For those who don't know...

1082
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,120
What the CRA...

1083
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,380
Thank God I'm a cat right now.

1084
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,500
Thank God.

1085
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,260
Doki is taking a break from taxes.

1086
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,120
Doki needs a break from fucking taxes and the CRA.

1087
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,440
For those who don't know what the CRA is.

1088
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,780
The CRA is basically the IRS.

1089
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,340
But for Canadians.

1090
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,600
So it's our tax system.

1091
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,900
And so I tried to call them.

1092
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,200
Earlier.

1093
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,900
People and members know why I have to call them.

1094
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,200
So if you guys wanna know the full story of why I need to call the CRA.

1095
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,160
You should join the members.

1096
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,600
Anyway.

1097
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,160
That's right.

1098
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,220
Nice segue, right?

1099
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:14,400
Anyway.

1100
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,580
So I tried to call them yesterday.

1101
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,820
But their offices closed at 8 for me.

1102
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,100
And so...

1103
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,680
Their offices closes at 8.

1104
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,520
So I was on hold for 2 hours.

1105
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,280
By the way.

1106
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,720
I was on hold for 2 hours.

1107
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,540
At the CRA.

1108
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:30,920
Hotline.

1109
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,140
And then like...

1110
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,140
And then at the moment.

1111
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,820
The moment it strike 8.

1112
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,660
They were like.

1113
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,160
Offices are now closed now.

1114
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,420
Call again next time.

1115
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:38,960
Bye.

1116
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:39,900
I was like.

1117
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:40,940
What?

1118
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,880
What do you mean?

1119
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,040
And my fish.

1120
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,300
Angrily eats my fish.

1121
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:56,840
Yum...

1122
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,280
So.

1123
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,720
And then.

1124
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,480
I googled it.

1125
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,180
I was like.

1126
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,100
Okay.

1127
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:07,540
So.

1128
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:09,880
So.

1129
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,660
What time do I call then?

1130
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,180
And then so, everybody was like.

1131
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,000
You should call at 5 in the morning.

1132
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,840
Or when it opens.

1133
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:18,760
But I didn't realize.

1134
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,140
By the way.

1135
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,980
I fucked up because I didn't realise.

1136
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,820
They actually.

1137
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,900
Like the old post.

1138
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:31,920
Before then, they open at 5 in the morning for PST, but they recently made it so that calls open at 3.30 in the morning.

1139
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:40,880
So I should have googled the CRA hours because I was reading like a Reddit post that said 5 in the morning because that was a year ago.

1140
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,700
But this year, apparently, they start running at 3.30 AM.

1141
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:52,560
But silly me, I waited at 5 in the morning to make my call and I was still put on hold for 40 minutes.

1142
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,820
I waited at 5 in the morning to call.

1143
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,940
I called exactly at 5 and I was put on hold for 40 minutes.

1144
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,900
And then, and then they're like, we can't help you.

1145
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,540
You have to send a letter to your tax center.

1146
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,820
You have to send a phys- and I was like, a physical letter?

1147
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,880
And they're like, yes, a physical letter, not by email.

1148
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:28,160
You have to write a physical letter to your tax center and then wait 15 days.

1149
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:41,960
Process your request and then you have to call back to this hotline and do the thing you want to do.

1150
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,680
And then I was like...

1151
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,000
Okay, thank you so much for the help.

1152
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:10,020
I was on hold for almost three hours just to be told to write a physical letter.

1153
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,660
I was on hold for almost three hours just to be told to write a physical letter.

1154
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:20,120
So that was my day and now I'm a cat.

1155
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,400
Cats don't need to call the CRA.

1156
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,640
Cats don't need to pay rent.

1157
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:37,140
Cats don't need to pay a corporate income tax and file tax returns.

1158
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,360
And now I'm a cat.

1159
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,100
Become cat to avoid taxes.

1160
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,180
Anyway, so that happened to me today.

1161
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,200
Cafe, thank you for the super chat.

1162
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,120
Thank you, thank you.

1163
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,840
My dearest tax representative, I'm sorry I could not submit my tax on time.

1164
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,700
I was a silly cat.

1165
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,500
I have to wait 15 days anyway.

1166
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,760
I can just write the letter tomorrow.

1167
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,720
I'll write the letter tomorrow.

1168
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,660
Today I just want to be a cat.

1169
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,840
It takes 15 days anyway.

1170
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,660
Does it really matter?

1171
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,720
I'm a kitty.

1172
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,340
If I pay taxes, I die.

1173
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,220
Thank you for the super chat.

1174
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,480
Interesting man.

1175
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,500
Thank you, thank you.

1176
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,400
Oh my god.

1177
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,040
Why are you just a selfie?

1178
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,380
Anyway, that was my cat day.

1179
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,160
My non-cat day.

1180
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,420
And now I'm a cat and I'm a little happier now.

1181
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,240
Yay.

1182
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,300
Reject humanity.

1183
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,900
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

1184
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:12,800
Thank you, thank you.

1185
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,480
JL, thank you for the super chat.

1186
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,360
Thank you, thank you.

1187
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:21,560
Thank you to CRA for mentally bringing my Oshi into giving up and becoming a cat girl.

1188
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,680
Thank you for the super chat.

1189
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,700
Thank you, thank you.

1190
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:33,200
And also, after calling the CRA, I had to call my bank because I had to file my corporate taxes and stuff.

1191
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,460
So like, I was like, how do you do this?

1192
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:44,240
And then I was on hold for an hour plus for that too, right after.

1193
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,080
Right after I couldn't get a hold of the CRA, I had to call my bank.

1194
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:55,140
And then they were like, they were like, I was on hold for an hour because I was like, why can't I log in via your partner bank?

1195
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,340
So for those who don't know, this is how the CRA works.

1196
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,160
You can log into your CRA account, your tax account via your partner banks.

1197
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,820
So like, I was like, why can't I log in via my partner bank?

1198
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,460
That's part of my business.

1199
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,000
And then I called them.

1200
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,140
I was so confused because I want to pay my fucking company taxes.

1201
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:22,020
And then when I got hold of them, she was like, oh, sorry, we don't use that anymore.

1202
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,960
It got removed in 2024 in October.

1203
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,200
So we don't use the, we don't, we're not like partnered with the CRA anymore.

1204
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:39,820
With the, you have to use like our own personal, our own personal online banking to like log in to do your taxes.

1205
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,580
And I was like, what?

1206
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,940
And I was like, okay, where do I go?

1207
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:58,540
And she was like, oh, sorry, like I'm not a financial expert regarding like taxes.

1208
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:06,160
So like, but you could go to this tab where it says like, um, there's a tax tab under pay bills.

1209
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,860
And then you go through the steps.

1210
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:13,860
And then there was like 70 options regarding what taxes you want to pay.

1211
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,980
And I was like, which one do I press?

1212
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,620
I want to, which one is it?

1213
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,480
I need to pay my company taxes.

1214
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,380
And she was like, sorry, I can't help you with that.

1215
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,860
You should ask your accountant.

1216
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:30,160
And I was like, my accountant doesn't really know what the fuck, like my accountant doesn't use this particular bank.

1217
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,140
That's why I called you.

1218
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,920
And then she was like, maybe just ask your accountant.

1219
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,580
And I was like, okay.

1220
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:48,140
Luckily, um, I like had a three, two hour email back and forth with my accountant.

1221
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:53,320
And then she, I had to like show screenshots of the, like, I was like, what do I pick?

1222
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,000
And she had to look through all 70 options.

1223
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,820
And was like, pick this one.

1224
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,020
That should be the company taxes you're supposed to pay.

1225
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,240
And I was like, oh, thank God.

1226
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,220
I was like, are you sure?

1227
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,500
And it was like, it was like every step I had to do.

1228
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:14,080
I had to take a picture of like what it, like take a snapshot of like each tab, like each thing I have to fill out.

1229
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,280
And then like the accountant like emails me back of like what I did put for each of them.

1230
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,680
And I was like, oh, thank God.

1231
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,800
Anyway, I still need to fix my CRA account though.

1232
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,620
So, gotta write a letter, an actual physical letter.

1233
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,520
And then wait 15 days to process.

1234
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:37,960
And then call the bank after, not bank, call CRA again after I received the thing I requested.

1235
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,120
So, I'm a cat now.

1236
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,140
So,

1237
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,420
that was my day.

1238
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,760
I can all, I can just be a silly cat.

1239
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,660
And that's why I'm here now, guys.

1240
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,420
That's why.

1241
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,120
Anyway, thank you everybody for the super chats.

1242
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,840
I really do appreciate it, guys.

1243
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,820
Thank you everybody so much for all the support, guys.

1244
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:32,680
Of me being a silly cat to avoid the scary real world out there.

1245
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,700
To avoid the scary real world.

1246
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,360
Oh, my God.

1247
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,560
I don't want to go back out there, guys.

1248
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:47,280
I don't want to go back.

1249
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,700
Anyway, let me see.

1250
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,380
I don't want to read them out.

1251
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,700
Blake, thank you for the magenta, super.

1252
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,340
Thank you, thank you.

1253
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,880
We need, she said, what face, kitty?

1254
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,480
Wait, what is that face?

1255
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,540
I don't know that face.

1256
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,260
She said, what face, cat?

1257
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,180
She said, what?

1258
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,920
That's like the only thing I could think of when I hear that.

1259
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:17,420
She said, what?

1260
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,700
What is that, like...

1261
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,880
Reject humanity, become cat.

1262
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,740
Ania, thank you for the super chat.

1263
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,840
Thank you, thank you.

1264
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,400
Oh, it's a half face.

1265
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,400
Cats, before you go, can you say meowty, dragons?

1266
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,220
Meowty.

1267
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,340
Thank you for the super chat.

1268
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,520
Thank you, thank you.

1269
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,540
Nexy, thank you again for the aqua super and for buying my dignity.

1270
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,460
How much dignity do I have left?

1271
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,860
Thank you for the aqua super.

1272
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,380
Thank you, thank you.

1273
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,560
JL, thank you for the aqua super.

1274
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,780
Thank you, thank you.

1275
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,920
I got my digital camera ready.

1276
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,900
Thank you for the aqua super.

1277
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,340
Thank you, thank you.

1278
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,800
JL, thank you again.

1279
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,020
Oh, no, don't, kitty.

1280
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:29,600
My heart.

1281
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,040
Wait, I hear my wallet making a run for it.

1282
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,960
Thank you for the aqua super.

1283
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,120
Thank you, thank you.

1284
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,000
Thank you, everybody.

1285
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,240
Alright, guys.

1286
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,600
I'm gonna be...

1287
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,460
This was an incredibly short stream, but don't worry, everybody.

1288
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,880
Oh my god, I can't believe an hour passes by already.

1289
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:49,840
That's crazy.

1290
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,920
That's actually really crazy.

1291
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,520
An hour passed by so fast.

1292
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:53,760
But...

1293
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,920
You won't say no to Don't Kitty, right?

1294
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,440
But tonight, I'll be streaming some Rivals to get my quota up.

1295
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:12,040
I'll be getting my quota hours on Twitch very soon.

1296
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:12,880
Not soon, sorry.

1297
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,520
Not very soon.

1298
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,920
I haven't eaten dinner, by the way.

1299
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,100
All I had was my fish.

1300
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,920
All I had was my...

1301
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,060
Anyway, I haven't had...

1302
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:27,060
I haven't had dinner yet, so I'm gonna go...

1303
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,160
I'm gonna get dinner.

1304
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,560
And then, I'll update you guys in maybe two to three hours.

1305
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,000
In two to three hours...

1306
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:41,200
When I'll be ready to go back into the mines.

1307
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:48,200
Go back to the Rival mines to farm away those hours.

1308
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,380
Thank you again, everyone.

1309
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,740
Rodrigo, thank you for the super chat.

1310
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,700
Thank you, thank you.

1311
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,220
Happy birthday with lots of meows.

1312
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,080
Thank you for the cute stream.

1313
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,080
Thank you for the super chat.

1314
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,600
Rodrigo, thank you, thank you.

1315
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,300
Of course, happy birthday to meow.

1316
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,720
Happy birthday to meow.

1317
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,660
Happy birthday, dear Rodrigo.

1318
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,720
Happy birthday to meow.

1319
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:10,340
Yeah!

1320
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:11,880
Happy birthday!

1321
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,040
Happy birthday, everybody!

1322
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,080
People legally changing their name to Rodrigo now.

1323
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:22,040
It should've been me!

1324
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:26,710
Oh, my God.

1325
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:27,590
Hey, guys.

1326
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,590
I'll see you guys later.

1327
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:34,290
Dough Kitty is gonna go get some dough food.

1328
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:38,450
Happy April Fools, everybody.

1329
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:42,070
Of course, this is not the last you'll see Dough Kitty.

1330
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:43,190
Don't worry.

1331
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,430
I'll be back.

1332
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,050
Maybe tonight.

1333
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,310
I'll just be a cat for tonight.

1334
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:51,130
Anyway, guys.

1335
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,030
Thank you all for coming.

1336
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:55,170
Happy April Fools, everyone.

1337
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:57,410
I hope you guys like your little...

1338
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,110
Your little April Fools stream.

1339
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:02,330
As always, everybody.

1340
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,590
Stay hydrated.

1341
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:06,130
Posture check.

1342
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,170
Get up and move around.

1343
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,790
Get your blood flowing.

1344
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,230
And instead of...

1345
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:14,670
Head to bed, cause you deserve it.

1346
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:17,170
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1347
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:18,890
Bye, guys.

1348
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:19,750
Bye.

1349
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:41,320
Whoa.

1350
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:45,380
Secret ending, but also, oh my God, I'm everywhere.

1351
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,460
Do not be afraid.

1352
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,840
Do not be afraid.
