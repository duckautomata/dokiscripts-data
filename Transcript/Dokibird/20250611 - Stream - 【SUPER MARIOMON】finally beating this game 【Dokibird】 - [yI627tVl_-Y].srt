00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,390
Hello, everybody.

2
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,710
I forgot I was muted.

3
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,890
Hello, everybody.

4
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,310
Hello, hello.

5
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,610
Thank you for the five.

6
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,670
Give the shit smack.

7
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,150
Thank you.

8
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:48,870
Thank you.

9
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,050
Oh, my God.

10
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,290
Okay.

11
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,770
I know, like, I don't sound tired, right?

12
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,130
It's like I was awake for a while.

13
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,530
Yes.

14
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,650
There's someone, somebody is getting stronger and smarter every day.

15
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,970
So, um, I've been awake since eight in the morning.

16
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,410
Um, I've only had five hours of sleep because somebody!

17
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,650
Somebody!

18
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,630
Oh, oh, oh, there he is, sleeping beside me.

19
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,970
Someone was like, feed me!

20
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,910
Feed me!

21
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,990
And then, like, and then after I fed him, he was like, that's right.

22
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,450
Now, walk me!

23
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,230
Walk me!

24
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,710
Alright, so, uh, dad update.

25
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,410
He is, I don't know how every day is a new dad update, but he, somehow, every day is a new dad update.

26
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,170
So, um, lately, he has become smarter and smarter every day.

27
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,250
He's adapting.

28
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,070
He's evolving.

29
00:04:49,690 --> 00:05:04,410
Um, because, uh, what he's learned, when I realized he, like, barks a little too much early in the morning when I'm very fucking tired, he, like, I would, like, I have this, like, bark collar next to me.

30
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:12,890
Like, it's, by the way, some people were, I, there was a short related to it, and they're like, oh, man, um, I can't believe, like, oh, why were you using a bark collar?

31
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,890
But, like, the thing is, I've only used it for, like, like, maybe, like, three days in his entire life.

32
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,510
And that's when he was, like, younger.

33
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,030
Like, you know, when he was, like, one or two years old.

34
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,870
So, like, but the trauma stays with him for years.

35
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,970
So, like, because, like, he knows.

36
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,950
He knows what it does.

37
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,990
Like, I've only used it, like, two or three days when he was, like, one, one years older, one or two years old.

38
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,590
But, like, he's still... it's been years and he still remembers.

39
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,350
The trauma still stays with him.

40
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,650
Because it's, like, the only way for him to, like, learn.

41
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:58,530
Because it's, like, smaller dogs are actually a lot harder to train when it comes to, like, barking.

42
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,050
Especially wiener dogs.

43
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,410
Wiener dogs just love to be loud.

44
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,150
So it's, like, a struggle.

45
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,010
If you've ever owned a wiener dog, you know how loud they can be.

46
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,530
And, like, they have, like, the second loudest bark out of all the dog breeds.

47
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,270
Wiener dogs, dachshunds, have the second loudest barks out of all dog breeds.

48
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,350
Which is fucking crazy.

49
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,270
Because of how tiny they are.

50
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,210
So, they're so fucking tiny.

51
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,290
But they're so loud.

52
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,930
So, I've used this bark collar for three days.

53
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,530
No, they are.

54
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,030
They are much louder than corkies.

55
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,090
Like, it's crazy.

56
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,530
But, like, the trauma stays with him.

57
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:49,930
So, you know.

58
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,130
So, I keep his bark collar next to me in bed the last couple of days.

59
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,470
Because, like, um...

60
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,210
Because the dog sitter was feeding him early.

61
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,770
So, like, he's been waking me up at 7 to 8 a.m.

62
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,510
because of it.

63
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,450
Because, like, that's his new routine now.

64
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,570
Um...

65
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,030
So...

66
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,870
Um...

67
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,930
So, that's why I've had his bark collar beside my bed whenever he does that.

68
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,310
And all I have to do is show him when he comes into my room.

69
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,370
And goes, like...

70
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:22,890
Walk me!

71
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,850
Feed me!

72
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,730
Feed me!

73
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,070
I just...

74
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,070
Still in my bed.

75
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:30,990
In my pillow.

76
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,930
Just find the bark collar.

77
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,590
Don't even look up.

78
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,270
And just show it to him.

79
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,670
And then he, like...

80
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,010
Oh, shit.

81
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,010
And then he walks away.

82
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,730
And then goes back to bed.

83
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,750
And he's like...

84
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,390
Okay, I can...

85
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,170
You know what?

86
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,330
I can wait an hour.

87
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,530
I can wait an extra hour.

88
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,110
That's alright.

89
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,790
You know?

90
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,510
Nah, it's okay.

91
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,870
I'll just wait an extra hour.

92
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,690
And...

93
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,870
And then I get to sleep.

94
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,150
Maybe an additional hour or two.

95
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,970
Anyway.

96
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,910
He's learned.

97
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,610
He has evolved and adapted today.

98
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,730
Um...

99
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,250
After he realized that, like...

100
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,970
Um...

101
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,450
I couldn't do this forever.

102
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,570
Because you know what he started doing?

103
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,210
He...

104
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,290
Because I was like, What the fuck is going on?

105
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,650
Because...

106
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,570
Okay, it was so weird.

107
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,190
So after I fed him...

108
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,750
Because I was like...

109
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,150
Oh my god.

110
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,070
Okay, I'll just feed you.

111
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,030
And I'll satisfy you for at least like two hours.

112
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,150
Before you wake me up to walk.

113
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,290
So...

114
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,810
I fed him at like...

115
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,710
Eight in the morning.

116
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,210
And then I went back to bed.

117
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,930
And then...

118
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,830
For some reason...

119
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,730
I heard distant barking.

120
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,110
And I was so confused.

121
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,410
I was like...

122
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,410
It's a little far away.

123
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:38,990
I was like...

124
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,230
What is he barking at?

125
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,510
And then I was like...

126
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,430
Why is it like...

127
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,050
So far away?

128
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,010
It's not in my room.

129
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:44,950
It's not in my bedroom.

130
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,170
It's not like...

131
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:46,830
In the living room.

132
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,110
It's like a little far.

133
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,890
And I got very confused.

134
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,010
And then he kept going at it.

135
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,170
I was like, what the fuck is going on?

136
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,830
So, you know, obviously, I got concerned.

137
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,890
Because I was like, that's new!

138
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,550
And I got up, and I looked and I was like, where the fuck is he?

139
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,050
I couldn't- I didn't know where he was.

140
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,810
I was like, he's not at the front door.

141
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:17,350
Because, you know, my first thought was like, I swear to fucking God, if he, like, is waiting for me at the front door to demand to be walked, I swear to God.

142
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,050
But I walked to the front door and he wasn't there.

143
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:20,670
So I got confused.

144
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,930
I was like looking at the room in the living room.

145
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,810
I was looking at his bed in the living room.

146
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,370
I was like, and I was like, did he lock himself in the bathroom?

147
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,430
Like, is that it?

148
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,770
Because the bathroom door was just slightly open and he didn't know how to get out.

149
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,770
I was like, no, he's not there.

150
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:41,870
And this little fucker, this little fucker, um, was in my office underneath my table.

151
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,870
And he was like, barking from underneath my table in my office.

152
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,230
And he was like, that's right.

153
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,310
You can't get me now.

154
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,270
And I was like, what are you doing?

155
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,450
I was like, come on, come over here.

156
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,570
And he was like, no, I'm gonna be under this table.

157
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,750
That's right.

158
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,450
You can't get me.

159
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,290
That's right.

160
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,530
Try to bring that back on it.

161
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,870
I'm right here where you work.

162
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,510
Don't test me.

163
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,670
That's right.

164
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,050
Oh, what if I fuck up your PC where you work?

165
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,910
I was like, I was like, what the fuck are you?

166
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,200
Come on, get out of here.

167
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,320
It's like, no, I'm not getting out until you walk me.

168
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,200
And then so...

169
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,900
So anyway, anyway, so I was like, I went back to my bed.

170
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,060
I was like, fuck you.

171
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,340
I'm just gonna go back to my bed.

172
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,520
Like, you can't stay there forever.

173
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,460
But he can.

174
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,060
It's like...

175
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,360
He can.

176
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,880
Because the moment I went back to the bed, he started barking again underneath my desk in my office.

177
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,200
And he's like, that's what you're gonna do.

178
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,980
You're gonna try and bring the bark on it.

179
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,840
That's right.

180
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,060
You have no power here.

181
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,300
And I was just like, what the...

182
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,140
Because he's never done that before.

183
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,320
He's never, like, threaded me like this before.

184
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,000
And so...

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,340
So I was like, oh, fuck.

186
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Okay.

187
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,500
Alright.

188
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
Like, obviously, I'm more awake now.

189
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,980
Because he made me get out from my bed to, like, try and find him.

190
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,940
So, like, obviously, I'm more awake as well.

191
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,480
Because, like, I don't know if that was also his plan.

192
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
He's like, that's right.

193
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,120
Move!

194
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,260
Move!

195
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,000
Now that you're up, you might as well walk me.

196
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,640
And now that you're not in bed, you might as well walk me.

197
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,220
Because I was like...

198
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,760
I was like, fuck, okay.

199
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,960
Now I'm not as tired.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,660
Because, like, I had to get up and find this fucker.

201
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,800
Seja, thank you for the super chat.

202
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,100
Thank you.

203
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,660
Thank you.

204
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,340
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

205
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,700
Thank you.

206
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,240
Thank you.

207
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,280
I always enjoy watching your streams.

208
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,000
So, like, at point, I was like, fuck.

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,560
And then the moment I got up and put on my jacket, he ran to the front door.

210
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,460
Because he knew.

211
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,280
The moment he hears me put on the jacket, he's like, I won.

212
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,500
And he ran to the front door.

213
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,760
He didn't wait for me to go to the front door.

214
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,300
He heard jacket sounds.

215
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,360
And he's like, that's right.

216
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,760
I won.

217
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,080
This little fucker.

218
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,200
I was like, oh my god, he's so lucky.

219
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,760
I was just too tired to fight back at that point.

220
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,300
I know people were like, you should really not let him do this to you or take advantage of you.

221
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,740
I'm so tired, guys.

222
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,520
You don't understand.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
I was weak.

224
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,880
He got me when I was at my weakest, guys.

225
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,860
I was weak today.

226
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:19,920
I couldn't try and outstubborn him.

227
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
I couldn't outstubborn him.

228
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,920
I was way too tired and he knew I was weak today.

229
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,120
And like, he won this morning.

230
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,780
He won.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,460
I had to order myself another fucking cup of coffee.

232
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,420
This one was another special shots.

233
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:48,820
I'm gonna try not drink coffee later for at least a week after this because I drank a lot of caffeine for the last couple of days.

234
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,500
I drank a lot of caffeine the last couple of days.

235
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,800
So I'm just trying not to drink caffeine the next week or two just so I don't depend on it.

236
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,060
I was... I'm just so fucking tired right now.

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,260
I've been like so busy too.

238
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,520
I've been incredibly busy like this week and last... this week and last week too.

239
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,060
So like I had to have caffeine.

240
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm literally like caffeinated up right now.

241
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,620
Anyway.

242
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,920
Anyway.

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,060
So... so he won this morning.

244
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,600
Like... and like he has a new strategy against me.

245
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,440
Um... and alright.

246
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,800
So not the end of dad updates because... um... oh my god.

247
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,700
He's such a whore.

248
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,140
Doki Amber Doge is such a fucking whore.

249
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,780
Um... so like you'll be like, oh what happened?

250
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,200
Okay.

251
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, obviously...

252
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
It's pretty lady time.

253
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:47,900
Alright.

254
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,800
So obviously I was taking him to the dog part, right?

255
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,780
He... there was a pretty lady and he like went straight towards her.

256
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,620
And I was like, yep, of course.

257
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:58,980
Alright.

258
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,080
Um... pretty lady time.

259
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,420
Okay.

260
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,220
And then... oh my god.

261
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,600
Okay.

262
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,180
So... so... he like walked up to the pretty lady.

263
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,780
Pretty lady bent down.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,940
And then... she was like, aww, and like starts... like you know, pet him a little bit.

265
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,480
And she's like... you know, pa?

266
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,300
Pa!

267
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,200
And this fucker was like, oh, you want me to give you pot?

268
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
You know what else I can give you?

269
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,180
That's even better.

270
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,500
And then he rolls on to like his back like, that's right.

271
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,440
This is better than a pot.

272
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,940
She was just like, okay, pot.

273
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,220
And he instantly like, yeah, you want a pot?

274
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,440
No, no, no.

275
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
No, touch me on my belly.

276
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,720
That's how like I see it.

277
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,260
And you make it sound so creepy.

278
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,760
Because I was like, why the fuck did you?

279
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,180
Like, she was just trying to be like, pot.

280
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
And then he instantly was like, no, no, no.

281
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,840
I want you to rub my belly.

282
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,920
He's such a creep.

283
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,560
That's what I'm saying.

284
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,780
I was like, he's such a whore.

285
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,760
He's...

286
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,060
Before.

287
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,520
He's done a...

288
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,100
The last time I saw him like roll on his back.

289
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,520
Where someone at the dog park was for that white dog.

290
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,100
The...

291
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,640
What was the giant white...

292
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,780
Not an Eskimo dog.

293
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,780
I forgot what they were called.

294
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,980
The really fluffy ones.

295
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,460
Now, remember the one where I showed you guys a picture?

296
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,440
Where he like rolled around.

297
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,740
I was like, yes, lick my ear.

298
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,580
Like that part?

299
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,780
Yeah, the ear licker.

300
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,580
Yeah, the Samoyed.

301
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,980
That was the last time he like rolled on his back.

302
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,460
Was for that Samoyed for like ear licking.

303
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,940
So now he did it again.

304
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,280
But this time for a pretty lady.

305
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,840
And I'm just like, oh my god.

306
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,980
I was like...

307
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,020
I was so...

308
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,840
I don't know.

309
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,180
I was a little...

310
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,000
Disappointed.

311
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,620
Because I was like...

312
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,260
Don't show your belly right away.

313
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,220
Don't ask for random strangers who are fucking belly rubs.

314
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,100
What the fuck is wrong with you?

315
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,940
Why are you getting freakier?

316
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,340
Why are you so freaky?

317
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,500
No belly on the first day.

318
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,100
Not even a hello?

319
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,620
All she wanted was a paw.

320
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,080
But free of belly rubs though.

321
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,640
The confidence is off the chart.

322
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,460
But yeah.

323
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,660
Anyway, that was some dad update for today.

324
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,540
Golden Helm.

325
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,340
Thank you for the super chat.

326
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,660
Thank you.

327
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,100
Thank you.

328
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,820
Dad software updates are getting out of hand.

329
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

330
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,900
Thank you, thank you.

331
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,500
Pets resemble their owner.

332
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,940
So I wonder what this says about...

333
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,000
That's not true!

334
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,460
I did not teach him that.

335
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,320
I...

336
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,620
I did not teach him that.

337
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,440
Oh, he left.

338
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,900
I didn't even realize he left a while ago.

339
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,780
He's like, oh man.

340
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,060
You're gonna talk shit about me?

341
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,700
Fuck you.

342
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm leaving this room.

343
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,620
He was sleeping next to me.

344
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,740
And then I was like, dad update.

345
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,320
And then he like disappeared.

346
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,820
I didn't even realize he disappeared until now.

347
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,760
I...

348
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,300
He didn't like the slander.

349
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,040
Usually like...

350
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,540
I've never seen him roll on his back for a pretty lady before.

351
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
So this is like the first time I was...

352
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,280
Oh my god.

353
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,120
Fucking whore.

354
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,680
But clearly, he's like, you're not enough for me.

355
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,820
Why don't you rub my belly like these ladies?

356
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,320
You used to rub my belly all the time.

357
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,940
I'm...

358
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm...

359
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,780
I'm...

360
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,300
Anyway.

361
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,420
Anyway.

362
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,580
But yes, that is all of that update for today.

363
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,180
Today we're also gonna...

364
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,280
Today we're also gonna be finishing Super Mario Man.

365
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,600
We're at the final area.

366
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,640
I believe it's basically like the Elite Four.

367
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,000
The Elite Four in Pokemon.

368
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,120
So yeah.

369
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm kind of happy to finish another game this week.

370
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,100
I might have overscheduled.

371
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,820
My week, despite how busy I am.

372
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,420
Oh my god.

373
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,440
I've been like...

374
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,940
Basically, I've been like doing a million things behind the scenes at this point.

375
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,200
Because of so many things that are coming up.

376
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,480
There's like, you know, the AX concert and everything.

377
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,000
But there's like other stuff as well behind the scenes.

378
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,540
So like...

379
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,660
I made a little mistake overscheduling my week today.

380
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,300
Like not...

381
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,380
Sorry.

382
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,760
Overscheduling my week.

383
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,420
But I also really, really, really wanted to finish Super Mario Mod.

384
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,600
Because we've been playing that game for a while now.

385
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,460
And...

386
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,040
I just...

387
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,900
Really...

388
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,680
Really...

389
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,640
Wait, what is this?

390
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,200
Uh...

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,700
Oh, okay.

392
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,320
Never...

393
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,140
Sorry.

394
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,700
I got a Discord message.

395
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,620
I was like...

396
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,800
What is this message about?

397
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,400
Sorry.

398
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,200
I had to...

399
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,500
I was just like being like...

400
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,920
Wait, who's this person again?

401
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,380
Anyway.

402
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,220
But I really want to finish Super Mario Mod because it has been a while.

403
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,680
And I personally don't like having a super duper long game series.

404
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,120
Just because like...

405
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,080
Just because I feel like...

406
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,120
You know, sometimes it does tend to drag on a while.

407
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,060
Especially if it's like...

408
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,400
Prolong to a long...

409
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,740
Like...

410
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,880
Prolong for like...

411
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,420
You know...

412
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,780
Like more than one month.

413
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,560
So I do want to like...

414
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,220
Try and wrap things up and stuff.

415
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,640
So I can play newer games.

416
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,960
And...

417
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,000
Like experience like new games.

418
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,960
New playthroughs.

419
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,560
And other stuff.

420
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,120
And also...

421
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
You know, I want to finish Onimusha.

422
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,160
Because you know...

423
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,920
There was just one more part.

424
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,580
And then we'll be done.

425
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,960
And...

426
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,600
No, it wasn't Frail.

427
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,540
She's baiting you.

428
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,080
And...

429
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
Sorry, I got like...

430
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,240
Oh my god.

431
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,220
Why are you like...

432
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,040
I have so many discs right now.

433
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,580
Like a...

434
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,040
Excuse me.

435
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,700
I am stream...

436
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh yeah.

437
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
They don't know that I'm streaming.

438
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,960
I always appear offline.

439
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,460
So no one knows whenever I'm online or offline.

440
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,500
So people won't...

441
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,100
I don't...

442
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,620
I don't know.

443
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,100
This is a me thing.

444
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,020
But...

445
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,000
I always appear offline on...

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm always offline on Discord.

447
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,240
Appear offline on Discord.

448
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,260
Because I don't like when people know whenever I am online.

449
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,400
And then...

450
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,720
Because like usually when people...

451
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,540
I found out...

452
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,060
This was like something I learned.

453
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,640
Learned...

454
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,520
When I learned in my past.

455
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,820
Was that...

456
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,740
Whenever I like appear online.

457
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,180
I get like a lot more messages.

458
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,940
And like a lot of people like...

459
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,140
Poking me for things.

460
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,160
But if I always am up here offline.

461
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,960
People...

462
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,700
No one will know whenever I'm actually on.

463
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,040
To like...

464
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,100
Ask me for things.

465
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,400
Because so like...

466
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:10,980
No one will know.

467
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,860
So they'll just like...

468
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,220
You know...

469
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,120
Send the message whenever they can.

470
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,960
Because they'll never know whenever I'm online.

471
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,180
But yeah.

472
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,880
So that...

473
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,100
You know...

474
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,560
I could just...

475
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,120
If I have like a little small break.

476
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,720
I could...

477
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,360
They have to guess when I'll be active.

478
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,080
Exactly.

479
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,460
They'll have to guess.

480
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,300
Now everyone will know.

481
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:32,460
No.

482
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,060
Everyone knows.

483
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,720
I like...

484
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,200
People who I actually like...

485
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,880
Work with.

486
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,820
Or like...

487
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,180
Talk to.

488
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,500
They know I'm always up here offline.

489
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Because I haven't been like...

490
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:40,860
Online.

491
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,860
On Discord.

492
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,240
For like...

493
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,180
Three plus years now.

494
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,320
JL.

495
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,360
Thank you for the super chat.

496
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,740
Thank you.

497
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,320
Thank you.

498
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,620
Because I've learned.

499
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,660
In the past...

500
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,280
I would have like...

501
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
I would also like...

502
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,380
Like before I started doing that...

503
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,440
I would also like...

504
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,680
Hide my game status.

505
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,940
Or like whatever I'm on.

506
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,280
So people won't know.

507
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,780
Like you know...

508
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,540
If I'm like...

509
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,180
Playing a game.

510
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,740
Or like doing something...

511
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,780
On like an app.

512
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,280
Or something.

513
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,560
People will like...

514
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,000
Poke me.

515
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,640
And be like...

516
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,040
You know like...

517
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,020
When I used to play Apex.

518
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,560
Or Overwatch.

519
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,760
People see me on Overwatch.

520
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,340
Or Apex.

521
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:12,940
And they'll be like...

522
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,880
Oh do you want to play...

523
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,500
Do you want to play Apex?

524
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:15,980
Or like...

525
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,180
Oh why are you playing Apex?

526
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,320
You should be doing that.

527
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,640
And then like...

528
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,180
At that point I learned how to like...

529
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,400
Not show my game status.

530
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,780
But then I found out...

531
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,500
It was easier to just never...

532
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,140
Be online.

533
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,220
Like...

534
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,740
I just...

535
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,340
Just never be online.

536
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,420
And then no one will know.

537
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,340
No one...

538
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,960
Will know if I'm busy or not.

539
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,180
Yeah anyway.

540
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,580
Anyway.

541
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,620
It's Super Mario Man time.

542
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,100
Let me...

543
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,960
Boot up that game real quick.

544
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,540
I'm excited.

545
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,320
I don't even know how much I actually technically have left.

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,880
I know we're just at the Leaf board.

547
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,980
But like...

548
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,280
Where's my controller though?

549
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,240
Wait.

550
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,140
Where did I put my controller?

551
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,280
Okay.

552
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
That's...

553
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,000
Last time I'll hear this song.

554
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,580
Oh yeah.

555
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,500
Also like...

556
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,000
I have to be like...

557
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,860
Less greedy about...

558
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,300
Oh wait.

559
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,740
I need to reboot.

560
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,100
Oh wait.

561
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,420
Never mind.

562
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,860
I have to be like...

563
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,280
Not greedy.

564
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,500
Less selfish about the games I want to play.

565
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,300
After this week.

566
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,740
It's time to play.

567
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,120
It's time to return the flavor of the month.

568
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,860
And streamer games.

569
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,860
I may or may not have been incredibly...

570
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,580
Not incredibly.

571
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,100
I may or may not have been like indulging...

572
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,240
Indulging...

573
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,660
In things that...

574
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,920
In like...

575
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,060
The most like...

576
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,620
Obscure type of games.

577
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,680
That people...

578
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,180
Might not know...

579
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,100
Where it came from.

580
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,500
So welcome back to...

581
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,980
Friend's lab.

582
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,480
Where am I?

583
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,760
Where the fuck am I?

584
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,240
Oh.

585
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,380
Oh okay.

586
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,140
I was like...

587
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,540
Okay, okay.

588
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,100
As long as you're having fun.

589
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,820
Yeah, we play a lot of...

590
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,620
Very, very niche games lately.

591
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,740
So I...

592
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,860
But next week...

593
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,680
Next week...

594
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,200
We'll be back to Elden Ring.

595
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,060
So at least...

596
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,520
You know...

597
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,900
At least we have one...

598
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,460
Popular streamer game.

599
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,400
Alright.

600
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,380
I think the...

601
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,780
The only issue...

602
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,360
The main issue is that...

603
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,500
I like indulging in these like...

604
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,040
Niche...

605
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,740
Being selfish...

606
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,560
A little selfish...

607
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,900
And playing these like...

608
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,620
Uh...

609
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,180
Uh...

610
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,500
Very niche...

611
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,120
And...

612
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,480
Uh...

613
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,500
Obscure games...

614
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,080
Like...

615
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,960
Uh...

616
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,840
But the thing is...

617
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,180
Oh, I peer into the abyss below.

618
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,520
The thing is...

619
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,620
Some of these games...

620
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,900
Take a really, really long time...

621
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,860
And sees a castle of lava...

622
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,120
Jump into the hole...

623
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
Alright, here we go...

624
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,140
Yeah, that's my issue...

625
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,240
At the moment...

626
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,120
I get a little selfish with that...

627
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,180
Okay, Kamek...

628
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,640
Okay, Kamek...

629
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,340
Gah, Mario...

630
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,600
Wait, I'm supposed to be here...

631
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,640
Calm down...

632
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,080
Hmm...

633
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,680
I...

634
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,160
The Honorable Kamek...

635
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm here in Lord Bowser's place...

636
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,000
He was officially invited by Princess...

637
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,340
To be part of this so-called...

638
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,420
Elite Four...

639
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,780
But he's being somewhat of a...

640
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,960
Sword loser...

641
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,440
I mean...

642
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,320
He's not feeling well...

643
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,060
And so...

644
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,800
That is why...

645
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,380
Aw...

646
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,920
Lord Bowser...

647
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:37,940
Uh...

648
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,300
Aw...

649
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,860
Lord Bowser's going through a heartbreak right now...

650
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,260
JL, thank you for the super chat...

651
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,380
Thank you, thank you...

652
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,520
RepoTap...

653
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,080
Gambit, thank you for the super chat...

654
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,840
Thank you, thank you...

655
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,040
I blame you for that, Burb...

656
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,140
Gambit, thank you for the super chat...

657
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,860
Thank you, thank you...

658
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,360
Hmm...

659
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,160
And so...

660
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
That is why I am here...

661
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,060
Me and my masterful stratagem...

662
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,660
Shall finally defeat you, Mario!

663
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
But that's not to say...

664
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,140
I won't like playing more niche games...

665
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,460
I just gotta be a...

666
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:05,880
Less...

667
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,780
A little less selfish and actually follow the algorithm just a little bit.

668
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,960
And then I can be selfish again, chat.

669
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,520
Don't worry.

670
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,360
I may or may not have been not following the algorithm.

671
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,640
Just doing whatever.

672
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,500
Mr. Broken Bond.

673
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,600
Thank you, Mr. Super Chat.

674
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,020
Thank you.

675
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,580
Thank you.

676
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,420
I know a great short game to play.

677
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,740
It's got Expedition 33.

678
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,360
Probably should be able to finish in just one day.

679
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,440
Yeah, we need a balance between niche and numbers.

680
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,000
Alright.

681
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,360
Oh.

682
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,520
Oh, he's sending himself.

683
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,120
He wants to get beat up already?

684
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,040
Okay.

685
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,160
Not gonna lie.

686
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,520
I feel like...

687
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,640
I feel like if...

688
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,880
If you send in yourself and I fucking beat the shit out of you that you faint, you should not be allowed to keep going after that.

689
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,740
I don't know.

690
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,800
I just feel like he should, like, stop.

691
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
I think he...

692
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,840
Like, the battle should just end, like, at that point.

693
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,000
Um...

694
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,780
Uh, bu-bu-bu-but.

695
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,820
I donate.

696
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,860
Thank you for the Super Chat.

697
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,160
Thank you.

698
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Thank you.

699
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,180
That's his son.

700
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,940
Kamek Jr. I mean, okay.

701
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,880
Then take him to the hospital.

702
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,320
I literally beat up your fucking son.

703
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,060
Sleepy Miracle.

704
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,060
Thank you for the Super Chat.

705
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,440
Thank you.

706
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:31,960
Thank you.

707
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,320
Follow the algorithm.

708
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,300
Don't break the matrix.

709
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:37,920
Alright.

710
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,500
Alright.

711
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:38,840
Storm throw.

712
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,240
Get over here.

713
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,240
Okay.

714
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:43,580
What?

715
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,220
Oh, wait.

716
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,660
I forgot.

717
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,060
Like, I was like, what the fuck?

718
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,900
You're all fire.

719
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm fire too.

720
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,760
That's like, how are you doing so much?

721
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
We're both the same people.

722
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,420
How are you doing so much?

723
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,020
You and me are the same.

724
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,580
Okay.

725
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,060
Thank God.

726
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,340
Okay.

727
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,580
Golden Shroom.

728
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:03,880
Wait.

729
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,780
Actually?

730
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,840
Yeah.

731
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,620
Golden Shroom.

732
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,060
Don't worry, Dad.

733
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,640
Eat.

734
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,720
Eat.

735
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,360
Keep eating.

736
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Keep eating.

737
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,800
Be big and sh...

738
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,780
We're not doing...

739
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,780
It's not time yet.

740
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,280
It's not time.

741
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,400
Oh, I had some mushrooms.

742
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,460
Oh, I think I do.

743
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,820
I already forgot, like, exactly what I have.

744
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,520
Nice.

745
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Goodbye, Blarg.

746
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,160
Yeah.

747
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,140
What's most squirrel?

748
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,240
Oh, that's the octopus one, right?

749
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm pretty sure.

750
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,520
He'll be fine.

751
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,640
That's the octopus guy.

752
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,460
Yeah, I knew it.

753
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,520
It's the fire water.

754
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,440
Alright.

755
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,800
Chuck him.

756
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,220
Yes.

757
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,500
Chuck him.

758
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,180
Scald.

759
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,340
Okay, that's just...

760
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,080
Wait, that's water.

761
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,000
Wait.

762
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,300
Wait.

763
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,780
No, wait.

764
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,060
No.

765
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
I was like, that's fine.

766
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,280
I was like, oh, wait.

767
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,940
That's water.

768
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,380
Fire.

769
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,180
Why?

770
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,940
Dragon.

771
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,720
It's okay.

772
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,480
We're fine.

773
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Everything will be fine.

774
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,140
What even is Breakdown Mullen?

775
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,060
Does egg bomb work?

776
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,520
Okay, that's good.

777
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:37,980
Okay.

778
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,800
Don't worry.

779
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
He also bombed me.

780
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,940
But it's okay.

781
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:42,960
Alright.

782
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,700
You're just...

783
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,460
Don't worry.

784
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,140
You're just a little bit poisoned.

785
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,020
It's okay.

786
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,420
It's just food poisoning.

787
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,640
It's so...

788
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,320
It's just...

789
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,760
Oh, it ignores your ability.

790
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,600
Oh, okay.

791
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Okay.

792
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,960
Also, let me know if the game music is a little too loud.

793
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Because I...

794
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,020
So, apparently...

795
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,380
Apparently, during the final level...

796
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,700
The final stage...

797
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,340
The...

798
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,540
The game music gets a little bit too loud.

799
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,840
Let me know.

800
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,530
Yeah!

801
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,630
It's okay.

802
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,850
It's okay.

803
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,670
You're just only a little hurt.

804
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,870
Don't worry.

805
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,390
Okay.

806
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,510
Red Yoshi.

807
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,150
It's kind of a little loud.

808
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,390
Okay.

809
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,530
I'll turn it down a little bit.

810
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,070
Alright.

811
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,310
Alright.

812
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:37,910
Bomb.

813
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:38,710
Alright.

814
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,450
That's egg bomb.

815
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,250
That's alright.

816
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,530
It's Yoshi versus Yoshi.

817
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,350
Oh my god.

818
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,730
He also egg bombed.

819
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,470
Oh wait.

820
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:47,770
Nice.

821
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,570
69.

822
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,310
Okay.

823
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,190
You both missed.

824
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,530
Okay.

825
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,290
It's like...

826
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,730
The battle of the egg bomb.

827
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,770
Alright.

828
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,810
It's literally...

829
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,410
Whoever egg bombs first.

830
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,410
Alright.

831
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,810
Nice.

832
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,090
You did...

833
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,230
Okay.

834
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:07,630
Goodbye.

835
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,870
I forgot.

836
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,030
I forgot like...

837
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,450
They stopped one more.

838
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,490
Alright.

839
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,210
Should be fine.

840
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,430
It's okay.

841
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,630
You died for the cause.

842
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,930
You died for...

843
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,470
You died for our sins.

844
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,730
Okay.

845
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,750
Oh, it's the angry son.

846
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,990
I hope I was at least a tough imponent.

847
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,720
Uh...

848
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,120
Oh yeah.

849
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
High horsepower first.

850
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,620
Because it's the first move.

851
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,600
What are you gonna do?

852
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,040
Cut me with the sun?

853
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,180
Oh, that's what you're gonna do.

854
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:45,600
Oh.

855
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,740
What the hell?

856
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,580
Whoa.

857
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:48,900
Wait.

858
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,780
That's a little...

859
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,360
Oh, that's okay.

860
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,320
That's okay.

861
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,300
Real sun.

862
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,320
You did it.

863
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,800
I knew you could do it.

864
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,040
I knew I could always count on you.

865
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,380
Solar Blade is a grass move?

866
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,240
It has fire and blade in it.

867
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,420
How can it be grass?

868
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,680
What?

869
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,520
Are you expecting to yell out to Lord Bowser for forgiveness?

870
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,860
I'll have you know.

871
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,620
I'd actually rather enjoy this game the princess put on.

872
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,380
This was my one chance to show off my strategies to your full potential.

873
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,740
So I'm just a little depressed.

874
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,880
Put me wallowing in peace already.

875
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,420
Wait.

876
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,500
Is he at the Elite Four?

877
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,700
He's at the Elite Four, right?

878
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,100
Okay.

879
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,720
Yeah, he is.

880
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,440
Oh.

881
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,900
I forgot.

882
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,720
This is the Elite Four.

883
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,900
There's no Pokemon Center.

884
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,520
Oh, wait.

885
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,640
Oh, wait.

886
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,560
I should not...

887
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,280
Oh, wait.

888
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,180
I should not have let Dad die.

889
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:45,900
Oh.

890
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,980
I was like, don't worry.

891
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,200
I can just heal up at this.

892
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,120
Guys, it's been so long since I...

893
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,260
It's so...

894
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,760
It's pretty noticeable that I haven't played Pokemon in a long fucking time.

895
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,840
I actually forgot that.

896
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,360
You don't...

897
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,180
You can't just go get healed per fight.

898
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,400
You have to heal...

899
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,220
Use your items.

900
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,260
Oh.

901
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,940
Guys, this is so long.

902
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,200
I gave up on Pokemon.

903
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,260
After it was at Pokemon X and Y.

904
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,740
If you guys didn't remember, Pokemon X and Y was 10 plus years ago, chat.

905
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,680
Salutations, Mario.

906
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,600
Surprised to see you here?

907
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,400
I'll have you know, I'm not just some old researcher.

908
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,500
I helped design the entire Cap Challenge alongside the Princess.

909
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,040
Which means I know more than anyone about how to battle.

910
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,800
Let me show you.

911
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,860
Stop.

912
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,540
I don't need to hear this.

913
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,120
Wait, we did this.

914
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,160
That's when gold and silver came up.

915
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,780
Right, guys?

916
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,860
Right?

917
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,680
Oh, yeah.

918
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,220
It's not...

919
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,280
Yeah, 12...

920
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,400
Sorry.

921
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,780
I meant 12 years ago.

922
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,400
Alright, let's...

923
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,540
Let's crush him.

924
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,340
That's right.

925
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,880
That's right.

926
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,940
Get crushed.

927
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,680
Oh, fuck.

928
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,200
No, not...

929
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,480
Dude, does everybody know ground moves?

930
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,920
Like, what's...

931
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,360
What's the point of being Elite Four if you all are in the same move sense?

932
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Why do you all know Earthquake?

933
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,560
Why do you all know ground moves?

934
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,380
You might as well just be the Elite Ground.

935
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,980
Oh, King Boo?

936
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:28,800
Oh, King Boo?

937
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,420
That's right.

938
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,660
Oh, the battle of the century.

939
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,780
Which king shall reign supreme?

940
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,680
Because it's good.

941
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,400
That's right.

942
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,620
A ghost weighs nothing.

943
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,090
The king...

944
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,190
The king...

945
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,470
The king...

946
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,330
The king...

947
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,350
The king...

948
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,550
Please stop making all the 38-year-old draggoods in chat sad.

949
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,370
Including me.

950
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:07,970
But...

951
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,270
That's okay.

952
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:09,770
Oh, look!

953
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,990
There's Rice Goon.

954
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,970
Is this, like, as easy to kill?

955
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,490
Yep.

956
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,430
Just as easy to kill as my Mario mod.

957
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,960
My high pause seems to be true.

958
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,460
You truly are all skilled.

959
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,590
Wait, why am I confused?

960
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,410
Dad, why are you conf...

961
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,230
Okay, it doesn't matter.

962
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,430
You can still heatcrash.

963
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,430
Yay!

964
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:48,850
Goodbye.

965
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,930
Okay, the hardest one was actually the first one.

966
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,930
Because he fucking knows Earthquake.

967
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,010
Goodbye!

968
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,170
Incredible.

969
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,490
You truly outdone yourself, Mario.

970
00:36:59,530 --> 00:36:59,970
Yay!

971
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,830
I did it.

972
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,630
Wonderfully done, Mario.

973
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,070
You made an old scientist weep with joy.

974
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:06,770
To think.

975
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,710
You put so much time and effort into the game I came up with.

976
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,290
It moves me to tears.

977
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,370
Go on.

978
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,170
Do me proud and finish your cap challenge.

979
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,210
Alright.

980
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:18,930
Oh yeah, shit.

981
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,290
Oh wait.

982
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,650
I need to go this way.

983
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,290
Work back.

984
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,030
I was like, where the fuck?

985
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,610
Where's the door?

986
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,690
I was like, where the fuck is the door?

987
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,370
Alright, let me check the pee pee moves.

988
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,570
Real quick.

989
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,750
I need to check if dad has enough.

990
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:38,730
Okay.

991
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,610
Just to be safe.

992
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,150
Just to be safe.

993
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,430
Let me...

994
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,430
Let's see.

995
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,250
I should have an extra...

996
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,010
Syrup.

997
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,310
Like a small syrup.

998
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,230
Because I don't want to use...

999
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,710
Do I?

1000
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,270
Okay.

1001
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,390
I don't want to use the one that heals all of them.

1002
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,470
Alright.

1003
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,450
We just need heat crash.

1004
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,710
Alright.

1005
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:02,350
What's this one?

1006
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,670
I see Peach's castle.

1007
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,810
Jump into the hole?

1008
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:06,750
Okay.

1009
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,150
Let's see.

1010
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,530
I know I'm fighting Luigi last.

1011
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,130
So...

1012
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:09,950
I'll beat up...

1013
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,090
My...

1014
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:11,710
Uh...

1015
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:11,930
Sorry.

1016
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,710
I'll...

1017
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,650
Let me rephrase that.

1018
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:17,630
I'll...

1019
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:22,910
Let me think of how I rephrase it so it doesn't sound that bad.

1020
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:23,990
Uh...

1021
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,470
Yeah?

1022
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,610
What?

1023
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,690
I'll...

1024
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,210
Do a...

1025
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,910
Non-violent...

1026
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,170
Mario...

1027
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,410
Battle...

1028
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,030
That's for fun...

1029
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,650
Against my girlfriend.

1030
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,390
Oh, grassy brains.

1031
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,950
Let's go.

1032
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,070
That should be easy.

1033
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,350
And it's all fun and games.

1034
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,250
And everybody is in on it.

1035
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,170
Yippee!

1036
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,070
And there's cameras everywhere.

1037
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,590
Master Mario!

1038
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,930
You've done well to make it this far.

1039
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,150
The princess has given me the great honor.

1040
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,050
Of being in charge of this arena.

1041
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,970
What type will I use?

1042
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:09,970
Well...

1043
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,970
I'll have you know.

1044
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:11,890
I...

1045
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,470
Used to work a lot with dragons back in my day.

1046
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,670
Now then...

1047
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,770
Let us do battle!

1048
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,810
Oh my god.

1049
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,430
He fucking invaded me.

1050
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,050
I...

1051
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,850
I thought...

1052
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,370
It said grassy planes.

1053
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,670
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

1054
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,170
He's a dragon trainer.

1055
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,170
Like...

1056
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,530
What the fuck?

1057
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,110
It said grassy planes.

1058
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,150
And I was like...

1059
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,430
Brassy planes.

1060
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,890
Aw man.

1061
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,330
I have the perfect mind for this fight.

1062
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,690
Oh no!

1063
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,510
Grass!

1064
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,570
Oh shit.

1065
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,470
I forgot this guy.

1066
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,430
Fire doesn't do well against him.

1067
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,310
Oh you're gonna just withdraw him?

1068
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,930
Just cause he like is flattened?

1069
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,730
Oh my god.

1070
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,470
Is this...

1071
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,950
It's him.

1072
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,310
It's him.

1073
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:04,350
It's you.

1074
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,090
Alright.

1075
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,530
It's fine.

1076
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,370
It's so...

1077
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,610
It's vormon.

1078
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,540
Nice.

1079
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,140
Yeah!

1080
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,100
Oh I just realized...

1081
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,800
You guys aren't leveling up because...

1082
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
I just realized...

1083
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,500
I just realized...

1084
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,820
None of you are leveling up because you fainted.

1085
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,680
Early on.

1086
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,800
I forgot about that.

1087
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,370
It's not me.

1088
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:37,570
What?

1089
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,610
You guys didn't know the lore?

1090
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,370
Oh my god.

1091
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,470
Aqua Tail?

1092
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,550
Where'd you fuck you get the water from?

1093
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,650
It's all grass!

1094
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,310
Where'd you get it?

1095
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,870
I'm surrounded by all grass.

1096
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,110
Yes!

1097
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,710
Yay!

1098
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,050
Alright.

1099
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:01,550
Yay!

1100
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,310
Everybody's leveling up.

1101
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,110
Yeah!

1102
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:06,890
Everyone!

1103
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,690
Alright.

1104
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,490
Wait.

1105
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,030
Does he have another T-Rex?

1106
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:11,550
How...

1107
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,410
Why does he have...

1108
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:12,570
Alright, right.

1109
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,490
We're gonna need you to do a very important job.

1110
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,130
Don't worry.

1111
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,290
I believe in you.

1112
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,930
Why does he have two fucking T-Rexes?

1113
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,670
Like, is one not enough?

1114
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,350
Alright.

1115
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,030
Let's see.

1116
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,030
I know I have...

1117
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,410
What was it?

1118
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,230
The max...

1119
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,310
Mushroom?

1120
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:32,950
Ultra Shroom.

1121
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,430
There we go.

1122
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:35,870
120...

1123
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,830
Yeah, we'll just use the Ultra Shroom for now.

1124
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,320
Alright.

1125
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,140
Because why have one?

1126
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:44,780
Oh, true.

1127
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,440
True.

1128
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Double the fun.

1129
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,800
Don't worry.

1130
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,260
You'll be fine.

1131
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,520
See?

1132
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,160
Look at you!

1133
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,020
You'll be fine!

1134
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,000
See?

1135
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,940
I told you you'd be fine.

1136
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,720
Nothing to worry about.

1137
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,040
Bye, Rice.

1138
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,760
Your sacrifice is not in vain.

1139
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,080
Look!

1140
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,740
Because Dad is so healthy now.

1141
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,180
Look!

1142
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,400
You did it!

1143
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,080
Pick your rice for your sacrifice.

1144
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,400
Okay.

1145
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:17,940
Storm show.

1146
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,920
Alright.

1147
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,120
Chuck this dinosaur.

1148
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,640
Oh my god.

1149
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,700
What the fuck are you eating?

1150
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,200
A berry?

1151
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,180
Where'd you get that berry?

1152
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,160
Where the fuck did he eat?

1153
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,000
Where the fuck did he eat?

1154
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,360
It's like sneaking popcorn into the movie theater.

1155
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,840
Who let this guy sneak in that berry?

1156
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,360
Oh my god.

1157
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,580
Oh my god.

1158
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,140
That's...

1159
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,260
Okay.

1160
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,040
He's not water.

1161
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,360
Okay.

1162
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,480
He looks like water.

1163
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,920
Because he's...

1164
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,120
Oh wait.

1165
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,600
He is water.

1166
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,280
I was like...

1167
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,740
Thank god he's not water.

1168
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,420
Wait.

1169
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,440
He is water.

1170
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,900
He he he he he he he.

1171
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,640
Can't believe it.

1172
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,080
Who let him smuggle in another berry?

1173
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh shit.

1174
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,300
Oh thank god.

1175
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,720
Oh wait.

1176
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,740
But he has more than...

1177
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,920
He can do it more than once?

1178
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,600
No!

1179
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,040
He can do it three times!

1180
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,360
Why is fire?

1181
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,660
Because I used up everything else.

1182
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,080
Alright.

1183
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:17,980
It's fine.

1184
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,220
Alright.

1185
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,680
I keep forgetting...

1186
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,080
I'm no...

1187
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,420
I keep forgetting dragons are resistant to fire.

1188
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,420
I don't know why.

1189
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,980
It's just like in my head.

1190
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,680
I was like...

1191
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,960
There's no way I can burn it.

1192
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:30,760
Cause like...

1193
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:30,960
Okay.

1194
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,620
It's cause like you know...

1195
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,720
You know what the meteor...

1196
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:33,900
What?

1197
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,780
And the meteor doesn't do more...

1198
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,640
More damage?

1199
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,740
The fucking dinosaurs got wiped out by the meteor.

1200
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,700
I don't understand.

1201
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,580
This doesn't make sense.

1202
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,180
If anything should be super effective.

1203
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,560
It should be in my fucking meteor mash.

1204
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,940
That should kill him off!

1205
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:52,700
Like...

1206
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,140
His entire existence should be gone!

1207
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,480
I don't understand the meteor...

1208
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,160
Yeah!

1209
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,440
But like...

1210
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,920
Alright, so you know how like...

1211
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,960
The reason why rock is so strong is flying is because of the phrase like...

1212
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,680
Hit two...

1213
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,420
Hit two birds with one stone?

1214
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,580
That shit?

1215
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,060
So like...

1216
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,260
In that case...

1217
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,840
I should be allowed to fucking...

1218
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,720
Like...

1219
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,580
Critical hit...

1220
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,440
Like they don't even...

1221
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,160
Like it doesn't matter what level you are...

1222
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,840
The moment I use meteor mash...

1223
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,780
He's just dead.

1224
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,440
I could be a level one Mario mod...

1225
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,800
But I fucking pull out meteor mash...

1226
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,200
And then...

1227
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,960
I wipe out their entire generation and existence.

1228
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,240
That's what killed him.

1229
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,940
And then I start the ice age.

1230
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,640
Oh, there he is.

1231
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,020
He's still flattened.

1232
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,420
It doesn't matter if it's...

1233
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:49,940
It's not a type.

1234
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,920
It should be like...

1235
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,500
The exception.

1236
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,200
It should...

1237
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,320
It should be the exception to the...

1238
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,720
To the Pokemon universe.

1239
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,290
It's almost like...

1240
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,810
Genocide is a crime.

1241
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,490
You know what else is a crime?

1242
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:08,910
Sending a child out into...

1243
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,930
Out into the wild...

1244
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,250
With no supervision.

1245
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,870
But we don't talk about that.

1246
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,050
Splendid.

1247
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,550
Simply splendid, Master Mario.

1248
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,610
Your skills are as superb as ever!

1249
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,870
Master Mario!

1250
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,270
You're absurdly worthy of the princess's wish.

1251
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,430
Now then...

1252
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,750
Proceed through this door...

1253
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,170
And continue your challenge!

1254
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,030
Alright...

1255
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,730
Let's see...

1256
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,310
Don't worry...

1257
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,810
I still have...

1258
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,010
Wait...

1259
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,050
Where's the DX?

1260
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:47,950
Oh, thank god.

1261
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:48,670
I was gonna...

1262
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,310
I was gonna be like...

1263
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:50,910
Wait...

1264
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,250
Did I use it all up?

1265
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,620
Kids used to play outside a lot, Doki.

1266
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,380
Yes...

1267
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,600
And that's why...

1268
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,520
That's why there were a lot of kidnappings back then!

1269
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,440
I know it's not one left!

1270
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,700
I know I have to defeat Luigi after this!

1271
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,840
And...

1272
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
Alright, Peach's castle.

1273
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,200
Ugh...

1274
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,380
Alright...

1275
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,600
It's okay, we have Dad.

1276
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,740
Alright, Peach.

1277
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,480
Mario!

1278
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,380
Great job on collecting all eight Power Stars!

1279
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,020
Now...

1280
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,580
You only have one more challenge in front of you.

1281
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,080
Defeating me...

1282
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,060
And the rest of the Elite Four.

1283
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,580
Alright...

1284
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,060
Well, like...

1285
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,760
It's just you.

1286
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,440
I like...

1287
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,020
Literally beat up your other...

1288
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,000
Your other Elite Three.

1289
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,720
Alright...

1290
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,780
It's just...

1291
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,100
Okay, she's like a normal type from what I remember.

1292
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,520
Oh, I forgot to give the PP back.

1293
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,180
Oh...

1294
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:55,640
Okay, it's fine.

1295
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,880
I won't need Storm Throw.

1296
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,560
It's fine.

1297
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,860
We don't need Storm Throw.

1298
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,120
Oh my god...

1299
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,900
Why is her entire Elite Four...

1300
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,080
Like...

1301
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:07,760
Good against...

1302
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,180
Dad!

1303
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,480
I don't understand!

1304
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,030
Pink is powerful!

1305
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,870
Yoshi was green.

1306
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:19,390
Oh my god...

1307
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,670
Do you think Peach is like colorblind?

1308
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,970
If only you had...

1309
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,810
I don't need a balanced team!

1310
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,970
I just need one thing and one thing only.

1311
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,030
A giant fat bomb!

1312
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,330
Alright...

1313
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,190
Goodbye, Birdo.

1314
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,760
Yeah, giant bomb and heat crash.

1315
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,920
That's all I need.

1316
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,220
Like...

1317
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,860
She's like pink is powerful, but she only has one pink Mario mod.

1318
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,340
What the fuck do you mean?

1319
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,100
Alright, there's a pink.

1320
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Okay, that's half pink.

1321
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,280
Alright, keep crushing it.

1322
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,400
Oh my god, it's faster?

1323
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,280
How?

1324
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,120
Okay...

1325
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,060
Okay, it does nothing though.

1326
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,720
That's good.

1327
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,100
One point...

1328
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,800
Yeah, it's a 1.5 pink.

1329
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,900
There's more green than there is pink in her team.

1330
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,420
Yeah, exactly.

1331
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,320
If all else fails, I still have explosion.

1332
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,940
Oh my god, she was actually the easiest out of all the ones I fought.

1333
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,000
Does this battle remind you of our first Mario?

1334
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,300
First what?

1335
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,260
First what?

1336
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,780
It's okay, I don't need my...

1337
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,820
I don't need this.

1338
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,880
Oh wait, I forgot.

1339
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,240
Oh my god, it's...

1340
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,060
It's charcoal.

1341
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,700
It increases my fire damage.

1342
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,280
Nevermind.

1343
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,820
I might have needed that.

1344
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,060
Yeah, first what?

1345
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:45,700
What?

1346
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,750
Yeah, it reminded me of our first battle.

1347
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,210
It was still as fucking easy as it was before.

1348
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,830
Yay!

1349
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,830
She was actually the easiest out of entirely before.

1350
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,430
Like...

1351
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,610
Jesus Christ.

1352
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,280
Excellent job.

1353
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,280
I mean, you have no issue with a challenge like that.

1354
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,080
You've done wonderfully, Mario.

1355
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:27,080
Between stopping Bowser's schemes and collecting the Power Stars, I'm not surprised to see you at the top.

1356
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,160
Go on.

1357
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,800
You've got more challenges awaiting you.

1358
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,620
Uh, Ray, thank you for the super chat.

1359
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,620
Thank you, thank you.

1360
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,480
Alright, I did it.

1361
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,800
The weight...

1362
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,840
The weight to the champion is now open!

1363
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,760
Here?

1364
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,200
Okay, I gotta heal.

1365
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,360
Alright.

1366
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,100
Where is...

1367
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,700
Okay, we gotta use...

1368
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,800
Okay, we gotta use the max one.

1369
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,620
Is it max here?

1370
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,580
Okay, oh, okay, that's all of them.

1371
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:54,900
Alright.

1372
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,820
We'll just make sure all of his PP is...

1373
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,580
Is okay.

1374
00:49:59,580 --> 00:49:59,720
Okay.

1375
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,220
And then...

1376
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,000
We'll heal him up, too.

1377
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:03,880
Ah!

1378
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,480
You know what?

1379
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,340
We'll just put 60.

1380
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,180
Lily, uh...

1381
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,360
Lil, thank you for the super chat.

1382
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,060
Thank you, thank you.

1383
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,460
That peach boosts that stuff to my brain.

1384
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,740
Thank you for the super chat.

1385
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,620
Thank you, thank you.

1386
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,420
60 is fine, actually.

1387
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,020
Actually, no.

1388
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:16,980
Alright, there we go.

1389
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,640
That should be enough.

1390
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,160
Alright, we fixed this PP.

1391
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,480
Where's the...

1392
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,080
Oh, it's up here.

1393
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,920
The boost panel leads to the champion.

1394
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,320
Alright, time to fight Luigi.

1395
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,900
Oh.

1396
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,540
I don't think I like this room.

1397
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,700
Oh, this is like sensory overload right here.

1398
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,000
I definitely did not like that room.

1399
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,260
Alright, Luigi.

1400
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,020
Fight me.

1401
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,400
What the fuck was he wearing?

1402
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,160
Mr. L?

1403
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,200
I be...

1404
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,140
I...

1405
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,700
I be to Mario here.

1406
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,220
I can't believe it.

1407
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,320
No.

1408
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,040
It's not over, bro.

1409
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,940
I need to wait here.

1410
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,880
Put the princess and the professor.

1411
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,540
To come so they know it's me, Luigi.

1412
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,960
In this disguise.

1413
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,820
Until then, I need to hold this position.

1414
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,260
Which means...

1415
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,500
Luigi, are you okay?

1416
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:11,980
Hark!

1417
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,860
I hear a challenger approach.

1418
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,260
How would it fare against...

1419
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,820
The green lightning...

1420
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,940
The gap champion!

1421
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,120
The mysterious...

1422
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,240
Mr. L.

1423
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,680
Mario!

1424
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,680
I...

1425
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,820
I mean...

1426
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,880
Ah, yes!

1427
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,540
Mario!

1428
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:31,680
Mario!

1429
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,000
The hero...

1430
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,200
The mushroom kingdom!

1431
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,740
It's too bad.

1432
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,520
You're a brother.

1433
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,500
And yet, the hero of the mushroom kingdom, Luigi.

1434
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,520
Is nowhere to be seen.

1435
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,140
To spectate our belt.

1436
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,380
Oh my god.

1437
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,740
I wonder who this guy is.

1438
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,520
Wow!

1439
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,280
Your mustache is awfully familiar.

1440
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,560
Like my brother.

1441
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,220
But it can't be.

1442
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,420
What have you done to my brother, Mr. L?

1443
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,380
I, Mr. L, have been here the whole time.

1444
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,580
To serve as the champion of the cap challenge.

1445
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,420
And will gladly accept your challenge.

1446
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,800
Have at you!

1447
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,540
Guys, I think it's Bowser with a mustache.

1448
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,960
It has to be.

1449
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,500
I've never seen him before.

1450
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,620
Who is this man?

1451
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,420
A green thunder strikes like lightning!

1452
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,520
Oh my god.

1453
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,680
It's fucking brown.

1454
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,380
Wait.

1455
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,100
Guys.

1456
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,600
Is fights strong against him?

1457
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,100
Okay.

1458
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,320
The one time I'm asking for type advantage.

1459
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,000
I swear to god.

1460
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,560
This guy is fucking...

1461
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,700
And this guy has fucking...

1462
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,320
I'm quick.

1463
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,120
I swear to god.

1464
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,320
Okay.

1465
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,120
Fire is...

1466
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,500
Okay, so...

1467
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,100
Okay, so...

1468
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:57,980
Oh, it's parts steel.

1469
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,120
Okay, it's heat crash time.

1470
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,780
It's heat crash.

1471
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,960
Yes!

1472
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,040
Yes!

1473
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,620
Sit on it!

1474
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
Oh, there we go!

1475
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,820
There we go!

1476
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,060
There's Earthquake!

1477
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,380
There it is!

1478
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,640
Wow!

1479
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,580
There...

1480
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,000
Oh my god!

1481
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,640
There it is!

1482
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,220
There's Earthquake!

1483
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,900
It's okay.

1484
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,500
That has to be the only one that has Earthquake, right?

1485
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,080
He has to be the only one that has Earthquake.

1486
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,540
He can tank only one Earthquake.

1487
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:32,700
Wait.

1488
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,260
What did they say he was gonna stand up?

1489
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,780
I wasn't paying attention.

1490
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,220
Alright.

1491
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:37,740
It's okay.

1492
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,000
He can tank it.

1493
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:41,960
Okay.

1494
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,740
I swear to god, if this is another Earthquake, I...

1495
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,000
I...

1496
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,440
If this is...

1497
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,180
If this is another Earthquake, I...

1498
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,640
You know what?

1499
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,720
It's time.

1500
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:54,720
It's...

1501
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,560
No, wait, no.

1502
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,760
No, it's not time.

1503
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,660
It's not time.

1504
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,380
It's not yet.

1505
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,360
Oh, never mind.

1506
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,460
It is time.

1507
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,320
He doesn't even live through that anyway.

1508
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:05,540
Let's do it.

1509
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:06,720
Alright.

1510
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,580
It's okay.

1511
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,680
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.

1512
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
It's okay.

1513
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,560
Alright.

1514
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,320
I still have...

1515
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,460
Oh my god.

1516
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,160
I should've bought more.

1517
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,460
No!

1518
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,140
Oh, I should've bought more.

1519
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,840
Oh my god.

1520
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,340
I...

1521
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,460
I should've bought more.

1522
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,220
I...

1523
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,940
I couldn't even use it if I wanted to, guys!

1524
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,880
That was my last revive.

1525
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:37,520
Okay.

1526
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,520
I think...

1527
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,400
He can...

1528
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,000
Tank this.

1529
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,240
I'm pretty sure.

1530
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,600
He can tank one...

1531
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,080
He can...

1532
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,820
He can...

1533
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,540
Oh my god.

1534
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,060
It's fine.

1535
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,080
You can tank this!

1536
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,200
Oh, you can!

1537
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,840
Thank god!

1538
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,820
Okay, he can.

1539
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,700
Guys, he can.

1540
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,160
He can tank it, guys.

1541
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:55,900
Oh my god.

1542
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,240
It doesn't even do that much.

1543
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,540
Oh, I should've used explosion.

1544
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,660
Oh no.

1545
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,800
You can take this!

1546
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,840
Okay, that's fine.

1547
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,700
Fine.

1548
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,140
It's fine.

1549
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:05,620
It's fine.

1550
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,820
He can tank it, too.

1551
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:07,820
Okay.

1552
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:08,180
Okay.

1553
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:08,580
Okay.

1554
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,900
I can't keep tanking it.

1555
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:10,440
Alright.

1556
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,160
I have to use...

1557
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,620
Where's my golden shroom?

1558
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,180
Oh, here it is.

1559
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,240
I have nine of these.

1560
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,660
I have nine of these!

1561
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,740
It's okay.

1562
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,200
It's okay.

1563
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,840
He can...

1564
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,720
He can keep tanking.

1565
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,600
As long as it's not critical, we're fine.

1566
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:35,820
Okay.

1567
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,540
Okay, just use storm...

1568
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,480
I'm not risking it.

1569
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,800
I can't even revive if I wanted to, guys!

1570
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,740
I used it all up!

1571
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,520
That was my last revive!

1572
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,760
Okay.

1573
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,340
It's okay.

1574
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,140
Mr. Fish.

1575
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,280
Mr. Fish.

1576
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,980
That sounds like a water...

1577
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,160
That sounds like a water...

1578
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:05,260
I have a feeling that Mr. Fish might be a water...

1579
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,160
Water...

1580
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,240
Water...

1581
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,920
Okay.

1582
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,180
I don't know.

1583
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,340
It seems very watery.

1584
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,840
Okay, we'll send stick bug out.

1585
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,300
Truly not!

1586
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,620
I swear to god.

1587
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,580
If it's like...

1588
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,620
If it's a fucking beta, I swear to god.

1589
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,580
Oh my god, it's this guy.

1590
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:21,860
Okay.

1591
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,100
Let me...

1592
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,060
Kill...

1593
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,140
Dad real quick.

1594
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,060
I bet it's flying!

1595
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,500
Alright.

1596
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,440
It's okay.

1597
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:33,520
Okay.

1598
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,580
I believe in stick bug.

1599
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,610
I believe him a little less right now.

1600
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,510
Oh...

1601
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,030
Oh...

1602
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,450
I...

1603
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:51,810
I...

1604
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,310
Oh...

1605
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:52,890
Yeah!

1606
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:55,910
Um...

1607
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,110
I...

1608
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,770
I guess...

1609
00:56:58,770 --> 00:56:59,390
Leech life.

1610
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,070
I guess.

1611
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,860
Oh!

1612
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:05,920
Okay.

1613
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,580
It doesn't matter.

1614
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,440
He's just gonna...

1615
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,540
Oh!

1616
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,280
It doesn't matter.

1617
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,920
He's just gonna go crunch and then goodbye stick bug.

1618
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,040
Goodbye!

1619
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:13,220
Hey!

1620
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,320
Yeah, I don't think stick...

1621
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:16,500
Okay.

1622
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,000
It's fine.

1623
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,860
We have Heftly as our...

1624
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,440
Emergency heal bot.

1625
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,200
We're dead.

1626
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,780
It's okay.

1627
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,380
No!

1628
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,960
Are you serious?!

1629
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,200
Oh!

1630
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:31,600
No!

1631
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,040
No!

1632
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,840
No!

1633
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,220
Oh!

1634
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:33,700
Please!

1635
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,260
Please!

1636
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:38,580
Leave this!

1637
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,560
Just leave this!

1638
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,560
Just leave this!

1639
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,140
What the f大家好!

1640
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:54,410
Guys!

1641
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:55,830
Maybe I have one

1642
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:02,800
virus!

1643
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,560
Maybe...

1644
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,120
It has to be in here!

1645
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,460
Okay!

1646
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,060
No!

1647
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,840
It's not over!

1648
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,960
It's not over!

1649
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,140
He's faster!

1650
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,860
Okay!

1651
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,560
It's not over yet!

1652
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,280
It's not over yet!

1653
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,120
It's not over yet!

1654
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,820
It's not over yet, guys!

1655
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,460
Okay, I think, I think it's possible.

1656
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,100
I think it's possible.

1657
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,960
We don't give up.

1658
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,700
Never give up.

1659
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,160
Oh my god.

1660
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,580
Why did I not bring more revives?

1661
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,320
Why was I so confident?

1662
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,020
I hear no bell.

1663
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,240
Lost to Mr. Fish.

1664
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,800
Why was I so confident?

1665
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,080
What kind of what the fuck?

1666
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,800
Why are you so weak?

1667
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,420
Holy shit.

1668
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,720
Oh, no, I got too cocky.

1669
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,720
I was like, there's no way.

1670
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,760
There's... Oh my god.

1671
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,420
No, the dude, I leave four all over again.

1672
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,740
I got too cocky.

1673
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,800
Goodbye, half-lea.

1674
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,240
Goodbye.

1675
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,480
Wait, wait, I can do this.

1676
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,560
You can let... Okay, I...

1677
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,220
Wait, no, he can.

1678
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,120
I believe.

1679
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,800
I believe.

1680
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,020
I will pour everything into you.

1681
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,500
I would pour it all into you.

1682
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,800
You got this, Anthony.

1683
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,160
Okay.

1684
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,620
Are you serious?

1685
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,120
Of course you use heal.

1686
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:44,720
Alright, it's five.

1687
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,020
It's okay.

1688
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,560
No, it's not okay.

1689
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,920
A fucking course.

1690
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,260
A fucking course you'd spam that!

1691
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,360
I'm not...

1692
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:54,540
I'm not...

1693
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,060
I'm not...

1694
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:55,960
A rude spam.

1695
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,800
Oh my god.

1696
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:04,840
Oh no.

1697
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:08,310
Oh no.

1698
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,890
Oh no.

1699
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:10,730
It's okay.

1700
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,450
We can spam heal too.

1701
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:15,030
Also, thank you for the raid.

1702
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,190
Thank you, thank you.

1703
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:17,510
It's okay.

1704
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,530
We also have heal.

1705
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,050
We can also spam it.

1706
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,830
It's a heal off.

1707
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,190
Oh my god.

1708
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,010
I swear to god.

1709
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,230
Oh my god.

1710
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,910
I swear to fucking god.

1711
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,830
Stop.

1712
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:34,310
How much does Bruce have?

1713
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,310
How much?

1714
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,870
He's just trying to...

1715
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:40,450
He's just trying to use up all my resources.

1716
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:44,790
He's actually fucking trying to use all my resources.

1717
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,410
Okay.

1718
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,370
It's fine.

1719
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:53,350
It benched...

1720
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,260
Bro is just...

1721
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:06,700
No!

1722
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,060
That's all my meteor mesh!

1723
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,000
He actually used it all up.

1724
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,920
Oh my god.

1725
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,540
I can't.

1726
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:17,840
I can't.

1727
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,700
Cause he's flying!

1728
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,400
He's flying!

1729
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,420
He can't.

1730
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,120
Oh my god.

1731
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,340
Isn't he flying?

1732
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,200
Oh, flying doesn't resist flying.

1733
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:34,540
Okay.

1734
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,600
Okay.

1735
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,320
Okay.

1736
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,520
Wait, I think I have one that does 200 heals.

1737
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,280
I'm pretty sure.

1738
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:50,700
Okay.

1739
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,240
120.

1740
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,220
I'm not risking that.

1741
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,760
I'm not risking that.

1742
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,260
That's fine.

1743
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,220
It's a heal off.

1744
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,900
I still have four more.

1745
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,180
I...

1746
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,300
It's not!

1747
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,220
It's not super effective!

1748
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,320
I tried it!

1749
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,620
It was, like, just the same.

1750
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,560
Okay.

1751
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,720
He's faster?

1752
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:15,700
Since when?

1753
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,980
Oh my god.

1754
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,140
Oh my god.

1755
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:26,200
Oh my god.

1756
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:26,940
It's fighty.

1757
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,140
It's okay.

1758
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,120
I still have...

1759
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,520
I still have three more shrooms.

1760
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,460
I still have three more shrooms.

1761
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,780
You got this, Emily!

1762
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,420
Oh my god.

1763
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,060
Not ice.

1764
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,800
Why do you have an ice move?

1765
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,820
Oh, thank god.

1766
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,420
Oh, it's fine.

1767
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:47,920
It's fine.

1768
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,760
Oh, thank god.

1769
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:49,400
I thought...

1770
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,180
Oh my god.

1771
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,780
I don't know why I thought ice was, like, good against me.

1772
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:55,540
It's fine.

1773
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:55,940
It's fine.

1774
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,020
You got this, Emily!

1775
01:02:59,380 --> 01:02:59,760
Oh!

1776
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,420
Okay, wait, wait.

1777
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:10,570
Okay.

1778
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:10,670
Okay.

1779
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:11,690
You got this.

1780
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:12,610
Just...

1781
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:13,510
Just keep...

1782
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:14,250
We have...

1783
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:14,570
We...

1784
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:15,370
There's no bell!

1785
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:18,370
Oh my god.

1786
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:19,370
Can you...

1787
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:19,910
Okay.

1788
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,010
He can survive another.

1789
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:22,070
Just fly.

1790
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,730
No!

1791
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,150
Not fucking knock off!

1792
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:24,790
No!

1793
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,340
No!

1794
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,400
You fucker!

1795
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:30,760
Okay.

1796
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,740
Okay.

1797
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,040
Oh my god.

1798
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,660
There's a poo!

1799
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:34,900
There's a poo!

1800
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,600
There's a poo!

1801
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:38,980
Okay.

1802
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,060
Okay.

1803
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,420
I still have one more shroom.

1804
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,120
It's okay.

1805
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,700
It's okay.

1806
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,040
What is that?

1807
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,360
What does that do?

1808
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:52,440
Dude!

1809
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,880
That seems so strong!

1810
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,200
Okay.

1811
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,180
Alright.

1812
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,540
Air slash or fly?

1813
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,060
Air slash or fly?

1814
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,660
All or nothing, guys.

1815
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,020
Air slash.

1816
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,680
No.

1817
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:14,520
No!

1818
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:15,700
What do you...

1819
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:15,960
Oh!

1820
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:16,460
Oh!

1821
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,360
Fly!

1822
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:23,580
Okay.

1823
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,980
No!

1824
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:26,140
No!

1825
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:30,970
No!

1826
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:35,040
I'm not...

1827
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:35,840
Air slash.

1828
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:38,720
Okay.

1829
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,700
Oh my god.

1830
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,220
Oh my god.

1831
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,970
It's I, Mr. L, will not acquit.

1832
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,190
Not even at my last capture.

1833
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:54,910
Okay.

1834
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:56,110
We have to...

1835
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:58,090
We have to heal.

1836
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,430
We have to heal.

1837
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,870
I think if he hits me, I'm fucked.

1838
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,190
We have to heal.

1839
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,190
There's nothing else.

1840
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,130
Do I have another...

1841
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:08,710
I have one more, right?

1842
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,110
No.

1843
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,610
That was my last golden shroom.

1844
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:11,730
That was...

1845
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,050
No.

1846
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:12,950
Don't!

1847
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:16,010
Dude!

1848
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:16,850
Don't heal!

1849
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,050
But, like, if he hits me...

1850
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,830
If he hits me, I'm fucked!

1851
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:23,110
Okay.

1852
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:23,850
I have one more.

1853
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,930
I have an ultra shroom.

1854
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,030
Um...

1855
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,690
That should be enough.

1856
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:34,620
Okay.

1857
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,180
Don't believe me!

1858
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,540
Oh no!

1859
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:43,820
Air slash.

1860
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,020
Flinch!

1861
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:45,480
Flinch!

1862
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:45,980
Flinch!

1863
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,700
Don't miss!

1864
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,420
Don't miss!

1865
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,200
We did it!

1866
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,100
We did it!

1867
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:56,700
We did it!

1868
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,460
Oh my god!

1869
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,460
I actually...

1870
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,880
Oh my god...

1871
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,550
Oh my god!

1872
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,930
I'm mysterious, Mr. L.

1873
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,150
The view...

1874
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,910
...to come back!

1875
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,330
Oh my god, he did it!

1876
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,830
I used everything I had!

1877
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,010
Oh my god, he whipped the clutch!

1878
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:30,010
We thought it was over after Dad fainted.

1879
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:32,250
We thought it was over.

1880
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,810
But we got that flinch.

1881
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:38,090
I guess I should have dropped the disguise now.

1882
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,170
Oh my god, who couldn't?

1883
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:40,590
Bowser?

1884
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,870
Don't tell I was your bro, right?

1885
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:51,530
The costume makes me feel powerful and makes sure that none of the Elite Four would give me an easy fight.

1886
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,430
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

1887
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:55,810
Thank you.

1888
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:56,310
Thank you.

1889
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:58,950
Never doubted you for a second.

1890
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,410
Oh my god.

1891
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:05,270
Even though I lost you, I'm still smiling.

1892
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,950
I've had so much fun with you.

1893
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:08,770
The Princess.

1894
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:09,830
The Professor.

1895
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:10,830
Bowser.

1896
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:14,170
Every run that I can't be sad about any of this.

1897
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:19,850
I am so glad that we were given this opportunity to play in the Kappa Challenge.

1898
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:23,990
And I wouldn't change it for anything in the world, bro.

1899
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:26,290
Very well said, Luigi.

1900
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:29,130
Ivy, thank you for the super chat.

1901
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:29,530
Thank you.

1902
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:30,250
Thank you.

1903
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,030
Kefliguna for the win.

1904
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,610
Absolute cinema.

1905
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,570
Thank you for the super chat and you're an Ivy.

1906
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:37,090
Thank you.

1907
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:37,690
Thank you.

1908
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,930
We heard the last part of your speech.

1909
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,190
And it almost brought me the tears.

1910
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:43,690
Oh!

1911
01:07:57,790 --> 01:07:58,970
Oh, Princess.

1912
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,630
I'm so sorry.

1913
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,570
I never want to make you cry.

1914
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,750
Now, I'm a little confused.

1915
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,170
I see two brothers.

1916
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,890
But, who is the champion?

1917
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:11,790
It's Mario!

1918
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,350
Professor, he gagged.

1919
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,250
He beat me to fair and square.

1920
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,270
I suppose that would make Mario the winner of the Kappa Challenge then.

1921
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:21,890
Well done, Dokio.

1922
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,650
And you too, Luigi.

1923
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,490
For making it just as far.

1924
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:27,470
Come.

1925
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,510
We must record you in the Hall of Fame.

1926
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:31,970
You go on ahead, bro.

1927
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:35,230
I'll wait for you here for when you're done getting your wish.

1928
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,170
Luigi, please, join us.

1929
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:41,070
You can also complete a cap challenge.

1930
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,490
You'll be recorded after Mario!

1931
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,070
But, what about the wish?

1932
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,330
The wish can come after... Oh, wait.

1933
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:50,750
The wish can come afterwards.

1934
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:52,650
Please, follow us.

1935
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,090
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat.

1936
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,010
Thank you, thank you.

1937
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:58,810
Okay, let's do this together, bro.

1938
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,510
Wahoo!

1939
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:01,350
Wahoo!

1940
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:04,810
Zekra, thank you for the 20 gifted ships!

1941
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,010
Thank you, thank you!

1942
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,500
Mario, what's wrong?

1943
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,800
Okay, not gonna lie, guys.

1944
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,720
I did not think we would have done that.

1945
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,360
I thought... I also thought it was over.

1946
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,800
I legitimately did not think we were gonna get flinched twice.

1947
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,060
Fistful of herbs.

1948
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,160
Thank you for the super chat.

1949
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,060
Thank you, thank you.

1950
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:32,780
Air Slash has a 30% chance and Hefley landed two of those.

1951
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,120
9% chance to land two flinches.

1952
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,600
Yeah, they clutched up.

1953
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:40,620
Yeah, I... I did not think we were gonna post it.

1954
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,960
I thought it was GG.

1955
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,460
I had to start all over.

1956
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,700
I don't know if I heard that right, but did Mario just say Luigi is the true winner of the cap challenge?

1957
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,380
Mario, what are you doing?

1958
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,340
Is that what Mario say true, Luigi?

1959
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,480
Well, Mario beat me in our last fight, but... but who got here first?

1960
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,600
It was me!

1961
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,040
I beat the cap challenge before Mario.

1962
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,640
Luigi, you should have spoken up.

1963
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,500
I was about to put Mario in the system first.

1964
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,320
Give me a moment to change it.

1965
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:30,750
Wait, but that means... All he gets... What?

1966
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:32,050
Why did I say anything?

1967
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:36,850
What do you mean?

1968
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:37,210
What?

1969
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:37,870
We lost?

1970
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:42,590
I had a pure absolute cinema fight and we lost?

1971
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:45,330
What is your wish, Luigi?

1972
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,430
What is your wish, Luigi?

1973
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,970
Luigi number one!

1974
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:55,550
I love you, bro!

1975
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,610
Wait, oh my god!

1976
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:58,410
Wait, I can talk!

1977
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,510
Love you too, bro!

1978
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,330
What?

1979
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,790
The one thing I said in this entire game.

1980
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:09,370
The game was rigged from the start.

1981
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,310
I never thought I would get this far.

1982
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,070
So, I'm not going to overthink this.

1983
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,910
And instead, wish from my heart.

1984
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,250
My wish...

1985
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,930
Is to go home with my breath...

1986
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:21,770
Oh my god!

1987
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,230
I gave you a wish and you wasted it?

1988
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:26,450
What the fuck?

1989
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,750
We have warp pipes, Luigi!

1990
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:31,030
We...

1991
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,390
Star, thank you for the super chat.

1992
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,490
Thank you, thank you.

1993
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,810
Let's go, Luigi.

1994
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,630
Never doubted you for us.

1995
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,130
We have fly!

1996
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,730
Warp pipes!

1997
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:43,870
Taxis!

1998
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:45,150
Yoshis!

1999
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,830
I think I can do that.

2000
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,430
Yeah, I hope you can!

2001
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:55,710
Wait!

2002
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:56,490
Wait, a princess!

2003
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:58,590
Can I add one more thing?

2004
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,690
What would you like, Luigi?

2005
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,450
He...

2006
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,990
He could have wished for world peace.

2007
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:10,510
But instead, he chose to go home and do nothing about it!

2008
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,450
I want...

2009
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:18,030
A copy of Super Mario Bros.

2010
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:19,610
3 for the NES!

2011
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,870
My man!

2012
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:25,250
Uh, don't you already own a copy?

2013
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,750
Super Mario Bros.

2014
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,510
3 over world peace.

2015
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,110
Yes, but it's my favorite game.

2016
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,910
And I want another copy in case we lose ours.

2017
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,010
Anything for your wish, Champion, Luigi.

2018
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:42,910
Not his job to wish for world peace.

2019
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,670
Now, please put your caps on the computer.

2020
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:50,670
Save forever more lives in the Cap Challenge Hall of Fame.

2021
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
Just go to the shop.

2022
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,760
You're not broke!

2023
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,840
It's not like we're poor, Luigi.

2024
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,140
We could buy that whenever.

2025
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,780
Now it's your turn, bro.

2026
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,140
I can't believe it.

2027
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:09,860
Two months.

2028
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,260
And Luigi...

2029
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,040
And all I got was Luigi wishing for us to go home.

2030
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,340
He just wants an even faster fast travel.

2031
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,400
I can't believe it.

2032
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,060
We are broke.

2033
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,000
There's dead!

2034
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,560
King of a Bomb!

2035
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:31,980
There's Stickbug.

2036
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,280
There's Dragoon.

2037
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,340
And then Dragoon.

2038
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,940
And then there's Ricegoon.

2039
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:43,620
And our...

2040
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:43,780
Shh!

2041
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:44,860
Careful!

2042
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,780
He's a hero!

2043
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,620
There's Heflikoon!

2044
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:48,860
Careful everybody!

2045
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,420
He's a hero!

2046
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:51,800
Ha ha ha ha!

2047
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,600
Rice!

2048
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,440
Thank you for the super chat!

2049
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:55,980
Thank you.

2050
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:56,660
Thank you.

2051
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,040
Hall of Fame.

2052
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,400
We're doing absolutely nothing.

2053
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:01,740
Let's go.

2054
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,200
You're lucky you had pretty privilege.

2055
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,650
She didn't even instantly send me home.

2056
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:20,930
What?

2057
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:24,010
I still have to walk back?

2058
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,720
I'm still walking back.

2059
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,860
What the fuck is this?

2060
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,460
What is my... What is your wish?

2061
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,160
They got a lot.

2062
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,020
Great.

2063
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,280
Thank you for the super chat.

2064
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:39,740
Thank you.

2065
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,540
Thank you.

2066
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,860
Remember our first battle with Luigi where buddies survived with one each other after that self-destruct?

2067
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:46,720
Good times.

2068
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:47,340
Great.

2069
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,720
Thank you for the super chat.

2070
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,320
Thank you.

2071
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,140
Thank you.

2072
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,520
Oh my god.

2073
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,240
We did it.

2074
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,320
But we did have one extra...

2075
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,860
We did have some after... Was it post-game things I want to do?

2076
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,320
So it's not over yet, guys.

2077
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,480
It's not over yet.

2078
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,300
It's not over yet.

2079
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:12,460
We have... I think one or two post-credits things I want to do before we...

2080
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,580
We end it here.

2081
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,460
Yeah.

2082
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,640
Just one or two.

2083
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,360
Depending on how I feel after one.

2084
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,500
I guess we do have a second stream tonight.

2085
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,640
And it's Rune Factory.

2086
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,460
And I think... And um... I want to have like too little energy for that.

2087
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:31,520
By the way... Rune Factory... I've never played Rune Factory before too.

2088
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,360
But yeah.

2089
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,480
Thank you for Alpharad... For... And his team... For making such a great ROM hack.

2090
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,480
It was really fun.

2091
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,500
I had a great time.

2092
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,460
But yeah.

2093
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,260
I heard it's like a farming RPG.

2094
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,660
So there's like... You can farm.

2095
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,760
And you also have... And there's also RPG elements.

2096
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,600
And like... I saw people in chat were saying that...

2097
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,060
Um... The newest game of Rune Factory...

2098
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:09,180
Uh... Streamlined a lot of things.

2099
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,660
So it's easier for newcomers to try it out.

2100
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,220
Which is me.

2101
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:12,740
I'm new.

2102
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,660
I'm new.

2103
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,220
Yeah.

2104
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,880
Well it's not just like... It's like...

2105
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:19,840
So it's like... You know.

2106
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,240
Like what you see in JRPGs.

2107
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,140
But they added like farming in it too.

2108
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,320
From what I've read.

2109
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,220
You should play Factorio.

2110
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,700
I don't know if I tried Factorio before.

2111
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,400
I know there was like a... A factory like...

2112
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,020
Game.

2113
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:33,960
Where you're on a planet.

2114
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,600
And I'd like... Play like 5-10 minutes of it.

2115
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:38,940
And I was like... I was so overwhelmed.

2116
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,300
That I just refunded the game.

2117
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,540
I don't know if that's... Oh it's a satisfactory.

2118
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Maybe it's... It's where you're like... On a plant...

2119
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,920
No it's not Planet Crafter.

2120
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,220
Planet Crafter was very easy.

2121
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,360
I enjoyed Planet Crafter.

2122
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,240
But there was... I think it was Satisfactory.

2123
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,120
I tried to do a Satisfactory.

2124
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,220
And then I played like 10 minutes of it.

2125
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,600
And then it was like... You got...

2126
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,300
There's like so many things.

2127
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,440
So many items.

2128
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,540
And builds.

2129
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,560
And like instructions.

2130
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,700
And then I looked at the menu.

2131
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,980
Like the crafting menu.

2132
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,400
For like... I think like...

2133
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,700
5 minutes.

2134
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,160
And then I closed the game.

2135
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,340
And refunded it.

2136
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,140
Because I knew like...

2137
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:11,900
I was not...

2138
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,440
I was not learning anything.

2139
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,300
I...

2140
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,020
This brain was not learning jack shit.

2141
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,760
I swear to god.

2142
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:22,140
If like...

2143
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:22,940
If I...

2144
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:26,480
I can't believe I just walked home after like...

2145
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,200
Luigi told Peach that he...

2146
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,060
His fucking special wish that took 2 months to get...

2147
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,840
Was to be TP'd back home.

2148
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:33,860
I...

2149
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,100
Alright.

2150
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:40,380
Let's do the post content.

2151
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:43,660
Alright.

2152
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:44,880
Look at that.

2153
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:46,060
We're back home.

2154
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:46,680
Oh.

2155
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,480
That was one heck of a battle, eh bro?

2156
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,360
You really wallowed me.

2157
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,440
Even my special disguise.

2158
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:56,920
Yeah.

2159
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,160
I want to give you something.

2160
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,300
Thanks for being a wonderful brother.

2161
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,020
And congratulations for defeating me.

2162
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,600
A piranha happy.

2163
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,940
After you beat me.

2164
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,600
I went ahead and let my party rest at the Diamond City Daycare.

2165
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,880
Little did I know.

2166
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,420
Good old buddy had left behind an egg.

2167
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,100
I didn't even know piranha happy could do that.

2168
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:20,860
Oh my god.

2169
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:21,260
What?

2170
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,020
You're just...

2171
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,160
Did you ask him if he...

2172
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,340
Did you ask the mom if like...

2173
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:30,360
She was okay that you literally gave away her child?

2174
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,220
Also, the professor was here earlier.

2175
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,440
He told me that there's still plenty left to do in the Kappa Challenge.

2176
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,620
And to keep filling up our title decks.

2177
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,040
I think I'll be taking a break though.

2178
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,520
And staying at home for a while.

2179
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,100
Everyone ever better though.

2180
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,340
Just give me a call at the Mushroom Hill.

2181
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,060
And me and my team will take you on anytime.

2182
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,520
He just like...

2183
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,800
Threw away her child.

2184
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,260
Just like that.

2185
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,220
She like gave birth and was like...

2186
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:57,740
Goodbye Sonic!

2187
01:18:59,340 --> 01:18:59,900
Wow!

2188
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,800
We gotta get Sonic!

2189
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:07,020
Alright.

2190
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,000
Dark Blade!

2191
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:10,960
Thank you for the Super Chat!

2192
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:11,760
Thank you, thank you!

2193
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,080
Can I please have Sonic named after me?

2194
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,180
Please, please, please!

2195
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:19,400
I've been wanting to ask since the beginning of your playthrough.

2196
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:20,880
Alright, jump the block.

2197
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,400
Alright, how desperate are you, Dark Blade?

2198
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,660
It's Sonic the Hedgehog.

2199
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,700
No, no, no.

2200
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,120
Medi and John gave me permission.

2201
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:34,820
Oh my god!

2202
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:35,800
It's the hills!

2203
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,940
Sonic's the name, spins my game.

2204
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:39,880
Oh my god.

2205
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:42,620
Sonic's the name, spins my game.

2206
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,520
You're too slow!

2207
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,200
Oh my god, I am too slow.

2208
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,120
Our Dark Blade keep begging until we get to Sonic.

2209
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,620
And then I'll think about it.

2210
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,080
We just didn't press charges!

2211
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,140
Medi, thank you for the Super Chat!

2212
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,240
Thank you, thank you!

2213
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,140
Oh!

2214
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:20,220
It makes a sound effect when you go past it, too!

2215
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,260
That's cute.

2216
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,020
I like that.

2217
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,080
Ba-dum-ba-dum-bum-bum.

2218
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,240
Ba-dum-ba-dum-bum-bum.

2219
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,040
Oh, yeah!

2220
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,360
This is happening!

2221
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:32,860
Alright.

2222
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:33,960
It's time.

2223
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,820
Sonic the name, spins my game.

2224
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,860
Oh my god!

2225
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,960
Excuse me, he's level 70?

2226
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,320
Oh, fuck!

2227
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:45,880
I'm scared if I sit on him, he'll actually just die.

2228
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,540
Okay, but what if I just...

2229
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,720
Wait, I can't capture him right off the bat?

2230
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,060
Wait, I cannot be used right now.

2231
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:57,320
Oh.

2232
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,280
Wait, it won't let me use it right now.

2233
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,260
Oh my god, he's so strong.

2234
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,560
Oh my god, he's so strong.

2235
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:10,140
Guys, I remembered that I have no heals.

2236
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,060
Oh my god, I almost won!

2237
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,280
Okay, thank god he didn't just die.

2238
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,800
He didn't just die!

2239
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,160
I was like, I'm scared.

2240
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:20,660
I think he could...

2241
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:24,620
I think, like, I legitimately could actually kill him if I just sat on him.

2242
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,360
I...

2243
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,020
I was so scared.

2244
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,420
Wait, I still can't catch him?

2245
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,680
What if I just explode?

2246
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,400
Oh my god.

2247
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,480
I don't think he's living.

2248
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:53,200
Oh.

2249
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,800
I did...

2250
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,440
Oh.

2251
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,160
Alright, Rice.

2252
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,660
This is your time to shine.

2253
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,500
You're too slow.

2254
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,120
This is it.

2255
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:07,840
Oh.

2256
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,380
This is it.

2257
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:14,960
This is...

2258
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,180
This is it.

2259
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:23,260
It's time.

2260
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,800
We will surely live long enough.

2261
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,840
We will surely live long enough.

2262
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,700
I can't capture him.

2263
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,240
I tried.

2264
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,020
It said no.

2265
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,810
He will pressure you.

2266
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,170
Alright.

2267
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:49,870
Nice capture.

2268
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:50,630
I tried.

2269
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,010
I swear to god.

2270
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:54,330
I swear to god.

2271
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:59,830
Oh, when I lowered him to 1 HP...

2272
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:00,850
I have to lower him to 1...

2273
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,090
Okay.

2274
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:01,810
That's fine.

2275
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:05,950
Oh, wait.

2276
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:06,910
That's not fine.

2277
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:07,570
Wait.

2278
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,510
He's gonna die.

2279
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:11,110
I petitioned the name to be signed.

2280
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,130
I mean, thank you for the super...

2281
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:13,790
Guys.

2282
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:17,030
I think he might die.

2283
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:21,350
I think he might die.

2284
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:22,730
The one time...

2285
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:24,390
The one time...

2286
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,350
I was like...

2287
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:26,010
You got...

2288
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,510
You can't support me now, Rice.

2289
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,550
And then...

2290
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:31,650
We got...

2291
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,670
Rice still finds a way.

2292
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:45,650
It's not my fault.

2293
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:48,890
Alright.

2294
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:51,010
It's okay.

2295
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,330
He's still...

2296
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:11,700
This is the more faking you demand in Darkplate.

2297
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,080
Thank you.

2298
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:13,600
Oh, wait!

2299
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,280
Wait, I can do this?

2300
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:16,160
Oh, it's like...

2301
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:34,640
Okay, that wasn't supposed to happen... Alright, the game was like, wait a minute... Never punish...

2302
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:35,340
Yeah.

2303
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:42,180
The game was like, okay, Doki.

2304
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:48,200
You were not supposed to... You were not supposed to kill Sonic.

2305
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,660
I didn't know!

2306
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:56,460
You fucking... Alright, rest.

2307
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,380
Oh, fuck!

2308
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,020
No, I forgot!

2309
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,280
You can still have perished!

2310
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,600
You still have perished!

2311
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,520
I forgot when you die, you still... Oh, my God!

2312
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,460
I'm so stupid!

2313
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,300
I... Okay.

2314
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,020
Okay.

2315
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:10,700
It's fine.

2316
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,140
The perished... It's fine.

2317
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:12,880
It's fine.

2318
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:15,660
As long as you don't die, it's like... Doki.

2319
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,400
Come on.

2320
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,320
I forgot.

2321
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,180
It's okay.

2322
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,260
Rice lived.

2323
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,160
Rice lived, guys.

2324
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:20,820
Rice lived.

2325
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,280
The ability did trigger.

2326
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,200
The ability did trigger.

2327
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,000
Darkplate.

2328
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:27,020
Thank you, Super Chat.

2329
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:27,780
Thank you, thank you.

2330
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,260
Oh, shit.

2331
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,900
Meep and Darkplate are gonna fight for the role of Sonic.

2332
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:34,800
Oh, my God!

2333
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,000
Oh, my God!

2334
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,480
Oh, my God!

2335
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,020
Okay.

2336
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:41,320
Okay.

2337
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,500
Just perished again.

2338
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,040
For...

2339
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,440
I...

2340
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,300
Okay.

2341
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,940
Clearly, you can tank this, right?

2342
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:47,380
Cause I need to heal up.

2343
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:50,160
I need to heal up that real quick.

2344
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,300
I'm pretty sure...

2345
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:52,360
Yeah.

2346
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,060
I still have one more Ultras room.

2347
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,180
I can't.

2348
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,000
Apparently, Sonic has to be one HP.

2349
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:06,210
Oh, my God.

2350
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:08,270
Oh, my God.

2351
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:09,150
Oh, my God.

2352
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:11,890
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

2353
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,290
What do you need Sonic?

2354
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:17,450
Darkwing instead of Darkplate.

2355
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,230
Manny, thank you, the Super Chat.

2356
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:20,230
Thank you, thank you.

2357
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:21,950
Okay.

2358
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:22,930
This is awkward.

2359
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,210
This is awkward.

2360
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:25,550
Great.

2361
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:28,570
Alright.

2362
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:32,130
I think Dad can survive this.

2363
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,610
I think he can survive this.

2364
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,520
Guys, I don't...

2365
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,520
Guys, I don't think he survived this, guys.

2366
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:55,940
I...

2367
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:57,020
I...

2368
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:57,420
It's okay.

2369
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:58,760
I have Earthquake.

2370
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,320
I have Earthquake.

2371
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:09,210
Oh, my God.

2372
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:10,510
Oh, my God!

2373
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:15,180
The power...

2374
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,440
Okay, whoops.

2375
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:17,060
Never mind.

2376
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,540
What type is he?

2377
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,560
A very scary kind.

2378
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,260
Oh...

2379
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,900
Okay, first impression.

2380
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:31,640
This is it.

2381
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,760
Oh, this is not it.

2382
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:35,820
Guys.

2383
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,440
I think...

2384
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,800
I think Sonic might beat me up, guys.

2385
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,400
I think Sonic might beat me up.

2386
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,480
Bryce!

2387
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:48,720
You just need to survive!

2388
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,940
Oh, my God.

2389
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,040
Sonic's gonna take my lunch money.

2390
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,020
I still can't throw it.

2391
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,080
It has to be one HP, guys.

2392
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,240
I still...

2393
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,180
Oh, my God.

2394
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:06,400
Please!

2395
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,040
I lost!

2396
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,100
Oh, my God.

2397
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,240
He took my lunch money.

2398
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,180
Oh, my God.

2399
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:13,840
I'm back home.

2400
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,580
It's like a fucking fever dream.

2401
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:17,100
Oh, my God.

2402
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,980
If only we had some revives.

2403
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:22,340
Is he just, like, waiting for me over there?

2404
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:28,090
He's too fast.

2405
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,010
He really is too fast.

2406
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:31,830
Okay.

2407
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:34,650
Do I actually...

2408
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:35,430
Okay, yeah.

2409
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:36,270
He's waiting for me.

2410
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:36,930
Okay.

2411
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,050
We gotta buy some heals.

2412
01:28:38,770 --> 01:28:39,050
Alright.

2413
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,290
I'm, like...

2414
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:41,450
I'm desperate for heals.

2415
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:42,270
Okay.

2416
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,570
There should be, like...

2417
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:45,570
Okay.

2418
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:45,650
Okay.

2419
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:47,810
I might be able to buy one-ups right here.

2420
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:50,430
Okay.

2421
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:50,850
Not here.

2422
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:52,730
No.

2423
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:53,390
I got him.

2424
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:57,990
Okay.

2425
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:58,350
Half.

2426
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,770
Okay.

2427
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:01,890
We'll buy...

2428
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:02,290
10.

2429
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:03,390
We don't need that many.

2430
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:05,650
We'll buy...

2431
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:07,530
Let's buy...

2432
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:08,170
Yeah.

2433
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:08,510
Okay.

2434
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:09,890
Let's just feed Dad.

2435
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:11,910
Okay.

2436
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:12,230
I...

2437
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:12,830
I got...

2438
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:13,490
I got this.

2439
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:14,130
I believe.

2440
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:14,270
You.

2441
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:15,490
Alright.

2442
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,330
Before we fight Sonic...

2443
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:17,390
Wait.

2444
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:17,830
Where's home?

2445
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:19,090
Where do I live?

2446
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:22,130
Where the fuck do I live?

2447
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:22,670
Here?

2448
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:23,030
Okay.

2449
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:24,210
I gotta use the bathroom.

2450
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,090
I'll be right back, guys.

2451
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:20,430
I'm back.

2452
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:22,830
Uh...

2453
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:23,150
Whoa.

2454
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,710
Uh...

2455
01:32:24,710 --> 01:32:26,070
Alan, Mehdi, fight!

2456
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:26,530
Lil!

2457
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,010
Zekra, Nyur!

2458
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:28,590
Plus!

2459
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:29,470
Bryce!

2460
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,070
Johnny!

2461
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:30,550
Mike!

2462
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:31,250
Nexi!

2463
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:31,970
Floor!

2464
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:32,410
Meep!

2465
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:32,970
Aphelion!

2466
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:33,510
Champions!

2467
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,850
Thank you!

2468
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:37,570
Alright.

2469
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:38,890
I'm ready.

2470
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,750
I'm ready to beat up Sonic!

2471
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:45,190
Can't believe he took my lunch money!

2472
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,010
Can't believe it!

2473
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:53,050
He fucking took my lunch money and then left me to die!

2474
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:55,170
Alright.

2475
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:56,290
Now I don't need to save.

2476
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:57,570
Not so Deadpool!

2477
01:32:57,810 --> 01:32:58,670
Thank you for the super chat.

2478
01:32:58,810 --> 01:32:58,990
Thank you.

2479
01:32:59,090 --> 01:32:59,630
Thank you.

2480
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:02,370
Get mugged, nerd!

2481
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:06,390
I have to go all the way back, too.

2482
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:08,330
Wait, I should have...

2483
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:08,630
Can you see?

2484
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:09,170
Oh, I can!

2485
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:09,550
Okay.

2486
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:10,610
That's good.

2487
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:12,910
The guy could use the Yoshi.

2488
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:16,250
I was gonna say, that's gonna take me fucking forever.

2489
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:17,730
Run over here.

2490
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,930
I like how Sari was like, wait...

2491
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,990
Okay, wait a minute.

2492
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:22,610
You were not supposed to kill me.

2493
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:26,290
I like broke this...

2494
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:26,930
He's like, wait.

2495
01:33:27,090 --> 01:33:28,150
That is not canon.

2496
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,990
Alright.

2497
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,530
I'm back again!

2498
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:35,790
This time!

2499
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:38,010
I actually have heals!

2500
01:33:38,950 --> 01:33:39,730
Hold on.

2501
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:40,870
That's illegal.

2502
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:43,050
That's right.

2503
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:44,990
I know what to do now.

2504
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:46,750
He crashed!

2505
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,990
There's no way he can one-shot me when...

2506
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:53,530
Okay.

2507
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:53,970
I...

2508
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:55,550
Slow it!

2509
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:56,920
I was gonna be like...

2510
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:57,930
Wait.

2511
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,690
Wait.

2512
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:00,870
Can he actually one-shot me?

2513
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,240
Alright.

2514
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:10,740
Oh, yeah?

2515
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:14,360
Okay.

2516
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:17,710
And then, all I have to do...

2517
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,480
You'll be fine.

2518
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,240
You'll be fine.

2519
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:32,100
You'll be okay.

2520
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,400
I know his move is like 20 seconds long.

2521
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,000
You can tank this.

2522
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:36,280
See?

2523
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,060
I told you!

2524
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,320
I told you!

2525
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:38,800
You can...

2526
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,660
I told you!

2527
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,000
I've always believed in you, son!

2528
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:43,680
I've always believed in you!

2529
01:34:43,740 --> 01:34:44,020
Look!

2530
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,960
You can come out of the attic!

2531
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:50,720
Alright.

2532
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,100
Nice.

2533
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,160
Okay.

2534
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,380
Maybe you won't survive that.

2535
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,160
Alright.

2536
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:00,660
Don't worry.

2537
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,020
You've done...

2538
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,240
You've done your job.

2539
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:05,940
Don't worry.

2540
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,740
You did what you were supposed to do.

2541
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:08,880
Alright.

2542
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:09,740
Now.

2543
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:11,280
Heat crash.

2544
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:19,170
Oh, thank God.

2545
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:19,870
I was like...

2546
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:22,050
Oh, that is going down awfully fast.

2547
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,950
I don't like how fast that's going.

2548
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:32,270
Alright.

2549
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:36,410
But how many times is he gonna use Acrobat?

2550
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,770
Surely not all the time.

2551
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,930
Surely it'll be fine.

2552
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:48,450
Oh, nice.

2553
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,170
Okay, we're fine.

2554
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:49,490
See?

2555
01:35:49,630 --> 01:35:50,250
I told you!

2556
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:55,600
Oh, that's still a lot.

2557
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:57,580
That's...

2558
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:58,560
That's...

2559
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:58,780
That's...

2560
01:35:58,780 --> 01:35:59,640
Alright.

2561
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,400
Oh, can he stop?

2562
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,060
Yes, he can.

2563
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,420
Yes, he can!

2564
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:07,060
Okay.

2565
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,360
Yes, he can.

2566
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,920
He can't stop that.

2567
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:10,860
It's...

2568
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:11,680
It's okay.

2569
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:12,720
It's okay.

2570
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:13,260
It's okay.

2571
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,300
We have...

2572
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:14,900
Alright.

2573
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,240
He's...

2574
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:20,820
It's okay.

2575
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,260
I have Earthquake.

2576
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,290
Okay, there we go.

2577
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:29,250
Alright, Dragoon.

2578
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,210
Use Earthquake!

2579
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:32,890
That'll make him one HP.

2580
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:36,230
Alright.

2581
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:38,290
Now's your chance.

2582
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:39,510
This is it!

2583
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:41,250
Some bear...

2584
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:41,670
Oh, wait.

2585
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:42,910
That was not the right one.

2586
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:43,310
Okay.

2587
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,250
Alright, I used the wrong cap.

2588
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,650
Whoops.

2589
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:48,810
Surely...

2590
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:49,730
I was like...

2591
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:50,410
This is it!

2592
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:51,550
Oh, wait.

2593
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:52,130
That was...

2594
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:53,730
That was the wrong cap.

2595
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:54,370
That was...

2596
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:56,290
Alright, Rice.

2597
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:58,350
Just live for like...

2598
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:00,370
One Mexican Sonic.

2599
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:02,910
No!

2600
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:03,230
Yes!

2601
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:07,720
Oh, my God!

2602
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,360
Mexican...

2603
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:08,440
No!

2604
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:12,410
What's...

2605
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:16,390
Hey, you could love Latinos too!

2606
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:21,070
Oh, my God!

2607
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:21,550
Thank God!

2608
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,270
Oh, my God!

2609
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:24,030
Now...

2610
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:25,510
Now we use the right one!

2611
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,130
We almost had Mexican Sonic!

2612
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:33,130
Oh, no!

2613
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:35,270
Oh, this is not good!

2614
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:36,850
This is...

2615
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:39,270
This is a little not good!

2616
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:41,450
What even...

2617
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:42,110
What even...

2618
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:42,970
What even is the sombrero?

2619
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:43,950
What even...

2620
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:44,470
I need it.

2621
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:45,850
I'm actually...

2622
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:45,990
Okay.

2623
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:47,770
Oh!

2624
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:49,150
Taking many turns!

2625
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:49,450
Wait!

2626
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:51,290
We used a lot of turns!

2627
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:53,630
Wait, actually...

2628
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:55,410
Actually, it might work.

2629
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,610
It might work out.

2630
01:37:58,810 --> 01:37:59,570
What is...

2631
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:00,690
It's a hat, Toki.

2632
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:02,170
Okay, that's a lot...

2633
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,230
We used a lot of turns...

2634
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:03,950
Okay, never mind.

2635
01:38:03,950 --> 01:38:04,690
Clearly...

2636
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,230
Clearly...

2637
01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:08,350
It needs to be like 40 turns.

2638
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:08,730
Oh!

2639
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:10,830
Instructions were definitely unclear.

2640
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:11,990
It was...

2641
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:15,790
I just thought that was enough turns.

2642
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:16,230
Okay.

2643
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:18,550
That's five.

2644
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:20,770
Yes.

2645
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:22,550
It's okay.

2646
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:23,790
I have...

2647
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,130
Oh, it's only 10?

2648
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:27,170
Okay, we definitely used more than 10.

2649
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,570
Okay.

2650
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:28,730
Alright.

2651
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:30,370
We...

2652
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:32,430
I'm pretty sure we used more than 10.

2653
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:33,890
I'm pretty sure.

2654
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:35,890
Where's my...

2655
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:36,170
What up?

2656
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:37,010
Oh, there it is.

2657
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:38,930
I was like, where the fuck did I put this?

2658
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:43,590
Okay, I have rezzed.

2659
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:45,610
The only issue...

2660
01:38:45,610 --> 01:38:46,870
Is that...

2661
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:48,950
Um...

2662
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:51,950
Wait, I have a ma...

2663
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,590
Where did I have a master cap?

2664
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,980
Oh my god.

2665
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:01,740
Wait.

2666
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:06,470
Wait.

2667
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:07,450
Wait.

2668
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:08,130
I have one?

2669
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:08,930
Wait.

2670
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:10,030
When did I got one?

2671
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,280
You guys are fucking...

2672
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:19,100
Oh my god.

2673
01:39:19,260 --> 01:39:20,220
You guys are fucking liars.

2674
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,220
It's fucking lying.

2675
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,720
Why do I have two helmet cap?

2676
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,120
Guys.

2677
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:39,160
Do we risk it with...

2678
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:39,700
Mexican Sonic?

2679
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,480
Alright.

2680
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,840
Alright.

2681
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:53,920
Let's see.

2682
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:54,540
Alright.

2683
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,520
This is my last chance.

2684
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:01,420
Oh my god.

2685
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:02,040
You fuckers.

2686
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:02,860
Why did you...

2687
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:05,380
You fuckers.

2688
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,560
You fuckers.

2689
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:06,740
You fuckers.

2690
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:07,800
He's mugging me again.

2691
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,020
He took my lunch money again.

2692
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,920
Oh my god.

2693
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,520
He took all my money.

2694
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:19,280
He he he he.

2695
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:19,620
He he he.

2696
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,680
I told you not...

2697
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,670
You fuckers.

2698
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,560
My money.

2699
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,700
He he he he.

2700
01:40:29,060 --> 01:40:30,500
Adios amigas.

2701
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,100
I request Sonic.

2702
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,760
Not Sonic but...

2703
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:35,400
Dark Blade.

2704
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:36,120
Sonic.

2705
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:39,420
No we're fine.

2706
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,400
Okay, guys.

2707
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:43,260
I know how to...

2708
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:43,520
Guys.

2709
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:46,060
Do you guys want to know how to efficiently level up?

2710
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:46,960
Watch this.

2711
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:50,720
Alright, Ryze, this is your time to shine.

2712
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:57,600
This is how... Okay, if you guys want me to... Okay, I'll level up, like, one time against Sonic.

2713
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:59,760
And this is how we're gonna do it.

2714
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:06,040
This is... Ryze, this is your time to shine.

2715
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,700
I just hit you.

2716
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,380
Ryze, this is it.

2717
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:15,440
This is your purpose.

2718
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,420
We're gonna be stuck on a time loop, guys.

2719
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,540
We're gonna be stuck in a loop.

2720
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,700
In a fucking time loop.

2721
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:32,460
Until, until dad is, like, level... Okay, not until level 100.

2722
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,460
No, I don't think I can do that for that long.

2723
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,620
We're gonna be in a time loop.

2724
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,580
It's Groundhog Day.

2725
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:40,620
Okay.

2726
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:46,820
Aw, yeah!

2727
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:48,200
You're too slow!

2728
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,800
Alright, here we go.

2729
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,060
Alright, Ryze.

2730
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,820
Do what you're...

2731
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,440
Do what you're known for.

2732
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,740
Oh, thank God, I was gonna say.

2733
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:02,820
Alright, nice.

2734
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:04,840
Okay, now...

2735
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,480
Now we can both die.

2736
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:12,240
I don't think you're gonna be able to live long enough to do that, Ryze.

2737
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,620
Thank you for the super chat!

2738
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:14,640
Thank you, thank you!

2739
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,580
It's okay.

2740
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,820
It's okay, I can tank three...

2741
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,060
I can tank three moves.

2742
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:21,760
Toki, wait!

2743
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,560
No, he does.

2744
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:27,460
You know how I know this?

2745
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:29,320
Because we tried it.

2746
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,500
You know, that's...

2747
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,220
I know this because we...

2748
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:38,220
We killed him already and it, like, reset...

2749
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:41,400
The world resetted stuff because it wasn't canon.

2750
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:48,500
Next thing, thank you to the super chat.

2751
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:49,300
Thank you, thank you.

2752
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:51,900
Do you really want Ryze to do what he's known for?

2753
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:52,560
Honestly.

2754
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:57,020
Wait, there's no way.

2755
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,280
Yeah, see, look.

2756
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:05,150
Alright.

2757
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:07,910
Yeah, you think you won this, Sonic?

2758
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,530
You really think you won this?

2759
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:11,550
Watch this.

2760
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:15,250
Oh, wait.

2761
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:15,890
Dad died.

2762
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,370
Wait, he was...

2763
01:43:20,670 --> 01:43:21,830
Wait, wait!

2764
01:43:22,110 --> 01:43:23,790
No, he was supposed to get the XP!

2765
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:24,830
I forgot!

2766
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:27,310
He was supposed to get the XP!

2767
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:29,550
Alright, there we go.

2768
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:29,990
See?

2769
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:33,910
It's...

2770
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:34,990
We're looping.

2771
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:36,930
We're in a time loop.

2772
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:39,090
We're in a time loop.

2773
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:55,450
We're in a time loop.

2774
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:55,770
We're in a time loop again!

2775
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:00,530
Okay, I don't think you're gonna be able to live that long.

2776
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:06,670
Mission failed successfully.

2777
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:08,950
That's right!

2778
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:11,130
I got you now, Sonic!

2779
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:13,130
I got you now!

2780
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:18,110
No, it's fine.

2781
01:44:23,290 --> 01:44:26,970
You can't take my lunch money no more, Sonic!

2782
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:27,950
You can't take my lunch money no more, Sonic!

2783
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:29,030
That's fucking right!

2784
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:36,240
That's right!

2785
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,520
My lunch money will stay with me!

2786
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:46,100
He stopped killing rice when he's been through it now.

2787
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,260
Alright.

2788
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,300
Use Earthquake.

2789
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:52,460
He's gonna die anyway.

2790
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:54,980
I can't catch him.

2791
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,200
He has to be 1 HP.

2792
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:57,620
Alright.

2793
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,020
Thank you for your sacrifice.

2794
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:01,140
Now he gets XP.

2795
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:06,060
And now Sonic is going to get one shot!

2796
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:07,800
Bye!

2797
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:08,900
It's okay!

2798
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:10,240
We're looping!

2799
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,000
Back to the time loop we go!

2800
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:13,380
Nice!

2801
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,040
Okay, now we don't have to level up anymore.

2802
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:16,040
Yay!

2803
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:18,980
Whoa!

2804
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:19,580
What happened?

2805
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:25,080
Yeah!

2806
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:27,340
Okay, now...

2807
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:28,680
We use Strength Sap.

2808
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:35,150
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

2809
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:39,050
Bum bum!

2810
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:41,630
Holy shit!

2811
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:42,170
Okay.

2812
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:43,830
It's fine.

2813
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:46,670
Now everything should be good.

2814
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:48,870
Everything will be okay now.

2815
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,290
Alright.

2816
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,360
Okay, now...

2817
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:57,210
I...

2818
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:57,710
Okay.

2819
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,050
I didn't expect to go that far.

2820
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:08,470
Yeah, but now Sonic's gonna die.

2821
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,070
Sonic's gonna die now.

2822
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:12,990
Now we loop him.

2823
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,290
Now we just loop him.

2824
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,760
Guys, I think he's gonna die.

2825
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:28,500
Wait, does...

2826
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,660
Do you think the loop works?

2827
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,980
For, like, Sombrero?

2828
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,820
It doesn't matter, guys!

2829
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,020
It just resets him anyway!

2830
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:48,740
It's okay.

2831
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,840
We're just XP farming.

2832
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,120
Yeah, it's probably just for the one battle.

2833
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,580
Alright.

2834
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,220
Yeah, Bryce doesn't need XP, guys.

2835
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:10,620
Guys.

2836
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:11,720
It's okay.

2837
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,360
Rice does not need the XP.

2838
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,260
Goodbye.

2839
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:19,620
It was nice seeing you, Transformer.

2840
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:20,880
Wow.

2841
01:47:25,670 --> 01:47:27,810
It is my life.

2842
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:29,550
Oh shit!

2843
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:30,410
Last Resort!

2844
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:30,930
Nice!

2845
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:32,110
An actual good move!

2846
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,190
Wait, actually, no.

2847
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:34,550
Nevermind.

2848
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:35,250
It's a terrible move.

2849
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:35,890
Nevermind.

2850
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:37,030
Nevermind.

2851
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:40,750
I thought it was something else.

2852
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:44,130
Back to the time loop!

2853
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,550
No, it's bad.

2854
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:48,810
Alright, okay.

2855
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:49,610
Now we try.

2856
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:50,950
Alright.

2857
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:52,630
I think I got this.

2858
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:52,970
Alright.

2859
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:54,590
My sacrifice.

2860
01:47:59,280 --> 01:47:59,920
Alright.

2861
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:00,780
Stick bug.

2862
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:02,400
Die for our sins.

2863
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,140
We got this.

2864
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,040
It's okay.

2865
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:12,600
Everything will be fine.

2866
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:14,680
No, we can't use the sap yet.

2867
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,840
Because if we use it...

2868
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,480
Before...

2869
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:21,860
Okay, use next capture.

2870
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:22,120
Okay.

2871
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:23,780
Now...

2872
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:25,480
All we need to do...

2873
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:28,080
Is put dad in here.

2874
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,140
And then...

2875
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:31,600
We crush him.

2876
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:32,860
It's fine.

2877
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:34,040
It's fine.

2878
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:35,660
It's...

2879
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:36,320
It's fine.

2880
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:37,580
It's fine.

2881
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,420
It's fine.

2882
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:40,540
It's fine.

2883
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:43,380
Okay.

2884
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,280
Everything is okay.

2885
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:54,680
Okay, and now... Okay, and now, after that,

2886
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:12,920
after that, all we need to do is... Give me a sec, I'm thinking.

2887
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,060
Alright, you can tank this.

2888
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,320
I know you can.

2889
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,560
I know you can, son.

2890
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:25,820
I know you can take this.

2891
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,560
Okay, and then we... Earthquake.

2892
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,200
Okay, I don't know if you can tank that, though.

2893
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,800
I don't...

2894
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,640
No, my Earthquake!

2895
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:39,060
Okay.

2896
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:41,060
That's fine.

2897
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:44,000
That's fine.

2898
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:45,720
I have an idea.

2899
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,940
Alright, this is it.

2900
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:49,980
Watch this.

2901
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,050
This is fine.

2902
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:05,890
Watch this.

2903
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:09,130
Oh!

2904
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:19,170
Okay, wait.

2905
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:20,890
Wait.

2906
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:22,670
I know what to do.

2907
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:25,790
I know what to do.

2908
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:28,010
Guys, watch this.

2909
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:31,130
Okay.

2910
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:32,870
I didn't think you'd die.

2911
01:50:33,590 --> 01:50:34,370
But don't worry.

2912
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:36,510
Don't... Don't worry.

2913
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:39,390
Everything will be fine.

2914
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,700
I'm watching.

2915
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,080
It's okay.

2916
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:49,480
You can survive this.

2917
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:50,540
It's okay.

2918
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,000
Okay.

2919
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,900
That's fine.

2920
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:58,440
That's fine.

2921
01:50:59,220 --> 01:50:59,540
That's fine.

2922
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:01,220
That's... That's more than fine.

2923
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:04,680
That's... That... You... You've done what you have to do.

2924
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:06,740
You've done what you have to do.

2925
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:07,580
That's fine.

2926
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:09,300
But now.

2927
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:10,400
Now.

2928
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,240
Watch this.

2929
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,640
He lives through this.

2930
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,400
I know it.

2931
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:25,660
Oh my god.

2932
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:32,020
Come on.

2933
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:33,080
Come on.

2934
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,540
Give me that one.

2935
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:35,780
No, are you serious?

2936
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:42,540
Weaker than Heat Crush.

2937
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:43,580
How?

2938
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,400
How is it?

2939
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:45,920
It's weaker.

2940
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:56,860
My money.

2941
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,680
It's weaker.

2942
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:04,650
Oh my god.

2943
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:06,710
I didn't know it's weaker.

2944
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:11,930
Oh my god.

2945
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:13,670
Okay, guys.

2946
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:16,990
I need to spend my money or he's gonna keep taking my money.

2947
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:20,490
I don't want him to keep taking my money, guys.

2948
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:23,930
I can't take my money if I'm broke.

2949
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:25,050
No, it's okay.

2950
01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:26,310
Guys.

2951
01:52:26,310 --> 01:52:26,490
Guys.

2952
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:29,930
We can't... If we save scum, we'll never learn.

2953
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:36,550
We'll never learn if we save scum, guys.

2954
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:38,330
We'll never learn.

2955
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:39,730
We got this.

2956
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:40,650
Guys.

2957
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:42,230
I don't need a level up.

2958
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:44,830
I'm at the perfect level.

2959
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:46,490
We're at 69.

2960
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:49,130
I can't ruin this.

2961
01:52:52,990 --> 01:52:55,850
We can't ruin the perfect number.

2962
01:53:01,290 --> 01:53:01,870
All right.

2963
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:03,450
This is it.

2964
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:04,450
I figured it out.

2965
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:05,090
Okay.

2966
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:05,890
I know what to do.

2967
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:06,250
Okay.

2968
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:07,110
All right.

2969
01:53:07,290 --> 01:53:08,150
I know what to do.

2970
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:08,530
Okay.

2971
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:12,030
All we have to do is...

2972
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:14,110
We heat crush.

2973
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,270
We heat crush first.

2974
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:20,670
And then I'll... And then we'll see what happens after that.

2975
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:22,010
Let's see.

2976
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:25,770
It's fine.

2977
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:28,290
I know my mistakes.

2978
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:30,030
I know what to do, guys.

2979
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:30,550
It's fine.

2980
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:34,810
I now know the explosion does less damage than heat crush.

2981
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:36,150
I can't believe it.

2982
01:53:40,130 --> 01:53:43,710
How does it do less damage than...

2983
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,670
Okay.

2984
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:48,030
All right.

2985
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:49,390
That's right, Sonic.

2986
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:51,050
That's right.

2987
01:53:58,450 --> 01:53:59,050
Okay.

2988
01:53:59,230 --> 01:53:59,330
Okay.

2989
01:53:59,330 --> 01:53:59,350
Okay.

2990
01:53:59,390 --> 01:53:59,670
Here we go.

2991
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:01,990
Ba-dum.

2992
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:04,210
Ba-dum.

2993
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:05,490
Ba-dum.

2994
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:05,750
Ba-dum.

2995
01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:06,590
Ba-dum.

2996
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:09,930
All right.

2997
01:54:12,690 --> 01:54:13,710
This is fine.

2998
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:16,850
I know who can tank this.

2999
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:22,330
Okay.

3000
01:54:22,330 --> 01:54:23,090
All right.

3001
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:24,750
You can tank two hits.

3002
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:25,890
I know you can.

3003
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:27,830
I know you can.

3004
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:29,070
You got this.

3005
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:31,650
I'm letting you out of the attic.

3006
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:33,970
Take two hits for dad.

3007
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:35,710
That's all you need to do.

3008
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:37,430
That's all you need to do.

3009
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:37,930
Oh, thank God.

3010
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:38,210
Okay.

3011
01:54:38,890 --> 01:54:40,110
I don't ask for much.

3012
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:42,110
I just need you to take two hits.

3013
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,990
So he can live and heat crush.

3014
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,200
All right.

3015
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,420
This is it.

3016
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:55,740
Okay.

3017
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:56,000
Good.

3018
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,800
You've done your job.

3019
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,020
That's all you had to do.

3020
01:54:58,220 --> 01:54:59,520
You did your job.

3021
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:00,540
Oh, yeah.

3022
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,420
And now... I heat crush.

3023
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,060
I heat crash.

3024
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:08,600
Let's go.

3025
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,060
Okay.

3026
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:15,100
I know like as long as it's not a critical hit, we live this.

3027
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:17,500
Okay.

3028
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:18,440
That should be it.

3029
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:19,340
That's all we need.

3030
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,360
That should be one HP.

3031
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,340
What?

3032
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,300
What?

3033
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:31,220
What?

3034
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,120
What?

3035
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:37,280
What?

3036
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:37,520
What?

3037
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:37,940
What?

3038
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:39,460
Since when was it not one hit?

3039
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,120
It was one hit before.

3040
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:46,760
It was one hit before.

3041
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:47,620
I swear to God.

3042
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:53,370
Oh, come on Dragoon.

3043
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:54,150
Oh, thank God.

3044
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:55,510
Oh, thank God.

3045
01:55:58,170 --> 01:55:59,710
How did he get stronger?

3046
01:56:00,190 --> 01:56:01,810
It was one hit before.

3047
01:56:02,270 --> 01:56:03,650
Oh, was it a critical hit?

3048
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:05,930
I must have had a critical hit.

3049
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:07,350
I'm not throwing sombrero.

3050
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:09,930
Guys, we're not throwing the sombrero.

3051
01:56:10,150 --> 01:56:11,970
We're not throwing it.

3052
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,400
Oh, my God.

3053
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:20,260
He's so strong.

3054
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:21,580
He's so strong.

3055
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,620
Oh, my God.

3056
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:23,680
I have three balls.

3057
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:25,320
Okay.

3058
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,160
It's okay.

3059
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:34,960
Come on.

3060
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,440
Shirley will have the critical chance.

3061
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:39,040
Shirley will be lucky.

3062
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:43,340
Shirley!

3063
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:57,170
No, we still have hope.

3064
01:56:57,530 --> 01:56:59,130
I have two more shots.

3065
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:02,750
Come on.

3066
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:04,310
Two more shots.

3067
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:08,190
It's not even close.

3068
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,010
I have one more.

3069
01:57:16,190 --> 01:57:17,390
I have one more shot.

3070
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:18,870
I have one more shot.

3071
01:57:19,090 --> 01:57:19,850
Rice, this is it.

3072
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:21,350
Rice.

3073
01:57:23,690 --> 01:57:24,990
This is it, Rice.

3074
01:57:27,310 --> 01:57:28,350
This is it.

3075
01:57:30,170 --> 01:57:32,030
We end...

3076
01:57:32,030 --> 01:57:32,310
We...

3077
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:32,930
This is it.

3078
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:35,070
Sombrero time.

3079
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,310
Oh!

3080
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:41,730
Oh my!

3081
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:57,730
Mexican Sonic is real!

3082
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:02,310
It works.

3083
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:09,200
I know...

3084
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:11,120
We'll never doubt...

3085
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,980
Mexican Sonic!

3086
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:18,520
I can't believe it works!

3087
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,600
We literally just need it.

3088
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,060
I can't believe it!

3089
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:25,840
I can't believe it's the time!

3090
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:27,720
Oh my God!

3091
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,320
We got Sonic.

3092
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:34,360
A blue hedgehog.

3093
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,460
And the fastest thing alive.

3094
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,480
A friend to all.

3095
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:40,700
And it backed into a corner.

3096
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:44,420
He'll unleash an ultimate power.

3097
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:47,340
With a seven chaos emerald.

3098
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,420
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

3099
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:51,620
Thank you, thank you.

3100
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,020
Lolly, thank you.

3101
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:56,740
I can't believe we got Mexican Sonic.

3102
01:58:56,740 --> 01:59:00,580
I have our last Mario Kart.

3103
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:06,020
I was like, fine, I'll throw this on Braille.

3104
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:07,840
We're gonna die anyway.

3105
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:09,860
I'll fucking do it.

3106
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:18,580
Darkblade, I really want to name this.

3107
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:25,060
I really want to, but I also really, really want to name...

3108
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:39,450
Darkblade, you, you understand though, right?

3109
01:59:50,910 --> 01:59:52,730
Oh, there's no heart?

3110
01:59:52,970 --> 01:59:54,930
Usually there's a heart for the symbol.

3111
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:54,930
Oh, there's no heart for the symbol.

3112
01:59:58,770 --> 02:00:02,070
I just love Latinas.

3113
02:00:02,210 --> 02:00:03,930
I highly...

3114
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:10,410
I gave my blessing.

3115
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:13,550
Darkblade, thank you in the super chat.

3116
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:14,990
Thank you, thank you.

3117
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:17,110
Okay.

3118
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:17,710
Okay.

3119
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:18,490
Okay.

3120
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:18,950
Okay.

3121
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:19,450
Just for you.

3122
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:25,900
B for... Okay.

3123
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,700
No, actually, I was gonna say it'll be...

3124
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:30,300
It might be bad.

3125
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:35,540
I mean, like, I'll give, like, an abbreviation, but I realize that might be bad.

3126
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:36,500
Alright.

3127
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:37,560
Latina.

3128
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,240
No, I just realized.

3129
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:48,260
Okay.

3130
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:49,280
Wait.

3131
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:51,740
Okay.

3132
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:52,320
Wait.

3133
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,200
I'm sorry, Darkblade.

3134
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,740
And, uh, we all know this is Darkblade Sonic, but also...

3135
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:02,740
It's like... It's like... It's like bracket, Darkblade.

3136
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:03,720
Bracket.

3137
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:11,400
Metal Sonic implies the possibility of a female Sonic.

3138
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:12,640
But that's true.

3139
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:18,580
We all... I'll be like, bracket, bracket, Darkblade.

3140
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:22,860
Wait.

3141
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:24,460
Love Latina shit.

3142
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:27,800
Wait.

3143
02:01:29,260 --> 02:01:30,240
D-B.

3144
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:31,320
Alright, here we go.

3145
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:32,760
D-B.

3146
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:34,040
Here we go.

3147
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:36,260
Latina's... Darkblade.

3148
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:42,820
Alright.

3149
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:43,940
Here we go.

3150
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:46,280
We have Mexican Sonic.

3151
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:46,960
Let's go.

3152
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:48,800
Sad... Excellent.

3153
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:52,000
Oh, it looks like a thumbs up!

3154
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:52,760
Wait, it does!

3155
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,440
Wait, you're right!

3156
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:56,000
It looks like a thumbs up!

3157
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:58,400
Latina's... Thumbs up!

3158
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:05,660
The quest... Yay!

3159
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:07,940
Get in my cap!

3160
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:12,920
Dude, thumbs up!

3161
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:14,980
Perfect.

3162
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:17,080
Oh my god, the survivor!

3163
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:19,760
Yeah, it looks...

3164
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:28,660
Okay, wait.

3165
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:31,480
We could do like... What if I just release him?

3166
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:32,540
Alright.

3167
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:35,340
Thank you for your service, Rice.

3168
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:38,820
Wait.

3169
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:41,260
Thank you for your service.

3170
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:43,240
Wait, does it look like... Okay.

3171
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:46,380
I'm curious.

3172
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:47,860
I'm here.

3173
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:48,140
Okay.

3174
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:50,380
Do I do like... D...

3175
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:51,660
Wait.

3176
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:53,300
What's this look more like?

3177
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:55,760
D...

3178
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,260
D...

3179
02:02:57,940 --> 02:02:58,420
Okay.

3180
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:01,140
Does this look more... Which one looks more like a thumbs up?

3181
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:02,460
Capital D?

3182
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:06,300
Or like...

3183
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,480
Which looks more like a thumbs up, guys?

3184
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,060
What?

3185
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:13,840
Oh, capital...

3186
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:14,740
Capital D.

3187
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:15,040
Okay.

3188
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:15,660
We'll do that.

3189
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:15,940
Alright.

3190
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:17,320
Alright.

3191
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:18,180
Let's fix this.

3192
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,200
Let's fix this real quick.

3193
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:33,880
Latina's...

3194
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,500
I... We... We like...

3195
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:37,440
Fucking renamed him so many times.

3196
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:40,820
Okay.

3197
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,240
Now it looks like a thumbs...

3198
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,280
Now it properly looks like a thumbs up.

3199
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:54,640
There we go.

3200
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:58,620
There we go.

3201
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:01,000
It does.

3202
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:01,380
Okay.

3203
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:01,940
There we go.

3204
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:03,960
Now it... Now it definitely...

3205
02:04:06,260 --> 02:04:06,820
Perfect.

3206
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:08,800
It's beautiful.

3207
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:10,520
It's beautiful.

3208
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:13,380
I can't believe we did it, guys.

3209
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:15,100
We fucking did it.

3210
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:17,420
Alright.

3211
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:18,840
Let's head home.

3212
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:19,100
Wait.

3213
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:19,900
I can't leave?

3214
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,200
Oh my god.

3215
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,400
He won't let me leave.

3216
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,860
It's like...

3217
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:25,200
Alright.

3218
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:27,660
Let's see real quick.

3219
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:33,220
I have to do like the walk of shame all the way back.

3220
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,280
Zeon, thank you for the super chat.

3221
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:37,600
Thank you.

3222
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,200
Thank you.

3223
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:39,000
Not so Deadpool.

3224
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:40,100
Thank you for the super chat.

3225
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:40,480
Thank you.

3226
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,160
Thank you.

3227
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:43,240
We don't have enough space.

3228
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,160
Zeon, unfortunately.

3229
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:47,720
We only...

3230
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,540
We have to have dot dot dot dot.

3231
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,440
It only makes perfect sense.

3232
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:53,740
But we did it.

3233
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:54,910
We finally finished...

3234
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:57,260
Super Mario mod.

3235
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:00,260
What a journey that we had today.

3236
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,180
What a fucking journey.

3237
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,540
I can't believe...

3238
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:04,080
I can't believe...

3239
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,080
The sombrero worked.

3240
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:05,640
I...

3241
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:07,980
I can't believe it.

3242
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,680
It actually worked.

3243
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:15,220
I did not expect the sombrero to be...

3244
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:15,460
I...

3245
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:16,660
I expected to die.

3246
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:18,980
I really did expect it to die.

3247
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:19,060
There.

3248
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,640
But wow.

3249
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,280
What a fucking journey.

3250
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,000
Today.

3251
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:26,460
Oh.

3252
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,280
We finished another game.

3253
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:33,360
That was fun though.

3254
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:34,660
It was fun...

3255
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:35,560
Playing...

3256
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:37,000
A Pokemon game.

3257
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:38,600
Technically a Pokemon game again.

3258
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:39,300
After what?

3259
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:40,460
12...

3260
02:05:40,460 --> 02:05:41,400
12 years?

3261
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:42,620
Um...

3262
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:45,100
Just revisiting like the Pokemon formula.

3263
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:45,900
It's been very...

3264
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:46,320
So long.

3265
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:48,480
But it was nice to try Super Mario mod.

3266
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:51,160
I huge shout again to Alpha Rad for...

3267
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:51,660
Um...

3268
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:53,240
And his team for doing...

3269
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:54,100
Making this game.

3270
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,440
I had incredibly fun.

3271
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:56,560
And I've had a whole...

3272
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:57,740
Had a lot of fun...

3273
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:58,040
Uh...

3274
02:05:58,040 --> 02:05:59,240
Having guys a lot...

3275
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:00,000
Part of the journey.

3276
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:01,760
And...

3277
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:02,960
Part of the journey.

3278
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:03,980
And...

3279
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:04,840
Uh...

3280
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,980
And you know...

3281
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,720
Being on my team and everything.

3282
02:06:08,420 --> 02:06:10,460
And watching me name everybody.

3283
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:11,240
Um...

3284
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:12,060
It was a great time.

3285
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:13,040
Um...

3286
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:13,900
I do have another stream...

3287
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:14,720
Later today.

3288
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:15,460
So...

3289
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:17,940
It's not the last you'll seem for me today.

3290
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:18,900
Uh...

3291
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,340
So...

3292
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:19,900
And like...

3293
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:20,520
I think like...

3294
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:20,620
What?

3295
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:22,100
In three more hours.

3296
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:23,580
So I'm gonna rest a little bit...

3297
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,860
Before my next stream in three hours.

3298
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:26,460
Uh...

3299
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:27,580
But thank you all for joining.

3300
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,500
Thank you all for coming here to watch...

3301
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,880
The end of the stream...

3302
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,060
To watch the end of the series.

3303
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:32,860
Um...

3304
02:06:32,860 --> 02:06:33,960
I noticed I could fight the devs.

3305
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:34,800
But like I feel like...

3306
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,040
I feel like it's gonna take a while.

3307
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:36,540
So...

3308
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:43,260
I feel like our devs are, like, gonna be a lot harder, so I'm like, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna try it.

3309
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,400
But thank you all for watching.

3310
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:49,000
We had a lot of fun watching.

3311
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:50,760
We had a lot of fun with this series.

3312
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:55,960
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3313
02:06:56,080 --> 02:07:00,460
And if you stay up with me, head to bed or stay up for a little longer for my RuneFactor stream.

3314
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:02,100
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3315
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:03,200
Bye, everyone.

3316
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:04,260
Bye!
