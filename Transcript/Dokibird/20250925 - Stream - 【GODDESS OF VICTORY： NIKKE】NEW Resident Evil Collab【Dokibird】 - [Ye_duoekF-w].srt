00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,570
Oh my gosh, where is it?

7
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,690

8
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,310
Oh, there it is.

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,670
Okay.

10
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,970
I was like, the Doki Loop.

11
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,570
Where is it coming from?

12
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,890
Junior.

13
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,270

33
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,610
I really like her jacket, though.

34
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,170
I like the jacket hang-off vibe to it.

35
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,530
It adds more to the silhouette and everything.

36
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,930
I mean, there's a lot of assets to enjoy with the new costume.

37
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,250
And as again, thank you again for the sponsor, Nike.

38
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,250
I really appreciate it.

39
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,390
I'm super excited to check out the new Resident Evil collab.

40
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,650
I believe you can pull several characters.

41
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,470
I think there's going to be Jill.

42
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,470
You can pull Jill later.

43
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,470
But right now, you can pull for Ada.

44
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,030
believe it's Jill, Ada, and Claire.

45
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:12,630
Yeah.

46
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,690
So I believe one of them, uh, Claire, you can get it through the events.

47
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,630
Um, but yeah, you can pull for Jill.

48
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,650
Yeah, the Jill.

49
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,870
Yeah, you can get, you can get a Jill sandwich later.

50
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:34,230
Um, but yeah, I'm pretty excited to try out like the host camp new, the new story event and the new mini game.

51
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,850
Apparently it's a mini game as well.

52
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,810
it.

53
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:48,250
Alright, let's move to before we, before we check out the game, I do have a video that I want to watch real quick or react to super duper quick.

54
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,470
I think it's to celebrate the promotion of the event itself, so let me pull it up.

55
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,030
Where is it?

56
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,590
Here it is.

57
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,970
Ooh, spooky.

58
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,730
I haven't watched this yet.

59
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,370
There's some Oh my god, there you guys are, dragoons.

60
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,010
There you guys are.

61
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,530
I think you guys are trying to summon me.

62
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,530
Spooky.

63
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,870
Oh, they're entering the house.

64
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,650
That's you.

65
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,300
Yeah, so that is the announcement for the...

66
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,420
Yeah, it's the mansion.

67
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,200
Yeah, I was like, oh my god, that's the mansion.

68
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,580
But it's pretty exciting.

69
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,980
I don't know, really, I'm going in blind regarding what the collab, uh, what the collab is in terms of like what the story is, what the mini game is.

70
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,360
So it's gonna be super exciting to check out, um, check all of it out together with you guys.

71
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,500
Uh, all right.

72
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,600
Let's get right into it.

73
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:55,860
All right.

74
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:05,380
Before we do play the mini game and the story, obviously we gotta pull for, we gotta do, we gotta pull for Ada.

75
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,840
We have to before we do anything else.

76
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,300
Like she has to be there.

77
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,700
I swear to her, she has to be there.

78
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,800
This time, this time, I'll get her.

79
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,240
This time, we will get her for real.

80
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,800
I swear to God, we will get Ada for real this time.

81
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,140
We will obtain the assets.

82
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,640
I think I can do it in 20 pulls.

83
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Knowing, even though I didn't cleanse my bad luck in a long...

84
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,860
I still haven't done it, guys.

85
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,140
I still haven't done it.

86
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,760
But this time, it doesn't include gotcha.

87
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,420
I'm pretty sure.

88
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,760
I'm pretty sure we'll be fine.

89
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,460
I believe...

90
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,920
I need you guys to also believe in me, okay, chat?

91
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,120
If you guys don't believe in me, we can't make it work.

92
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,940
So I need you to also believe in me as well.

93
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,520
So then we can have Ada as part of our little collection.

94
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,300
I think we can do it in 20 polls.

95
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,720
I think it's possible.

96
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,420
All right, let's see.

97
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,940
We can do it.

98
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,980
Yeah, believe in me that believes in you.

99
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,080
All right, there you go.

100
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,900
There's Ada right here.

101
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,900
There she is.

102
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,620
Oh, yeah.

103
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,080
Sound guy.

104
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,540
Let me know if that's...

105
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:47,760
Oh, wait.

106
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,380
I realized the sound was not playing when I was...

107
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,800
The sound guy.

108
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,460
Let me know if everything is okay.

109
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,040
I just gotta make sure.

110
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,880
Uh...

111
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,480
Uh...

112
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,660
Alright.

113
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,460
Yay, claim all.

114
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,060
Claim all.

115
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,420
Whenever I tab out, the sound disappears.

116
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,180
I don't know why.

117
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,240
Okay, so that's the story of it.

118
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,740
Look, I still have her.

119
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,860
I still have little mermaid.

120
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,900
I think I pull...

121
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,600
I don't even remember how many times it took me to pull her.

122
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,140
But I think it was once, right?

123
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,100
I say as I cope.

124
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,800
I mean, I pull everything in one tribe.

125
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,100
That's how lucky I am, right?

00:10:37,120 --> 00:11:02,560

Never mind.

144
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,020
It gave me a little pause.

145
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,800
It gave me a little pause.

146
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
I thought that was when it starts glowing.

147
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,680
I was like, oh my god, it's going to glow.

148
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,940
And then it's like, nope, that's it.

149
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,980
That's all you're going to get.

150
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,880
Oh my god, not the goddamn nerd.

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,350
Wait, which game is she from, guys?

174
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,010

175

Thank you for the super chat.

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,570
Thank you.

179
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,150
Thank you, Sonic.

180
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,730
It's...

181
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,410
It's okay.

182
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,690
It's okay.

183
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,770
I have...

184
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,070
Guys, I think... Oh, I can... Oh, wait, I have...

185
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,610
I have gems.

186
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,090
I have gems.

187
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:21,350
Okay.

188
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,830
I think you can pull in four tries.

189
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,450
I think... Alright.

190
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,870
Okay.

191
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait!

192
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,480
Wait!

193
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,100
What?!

194
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,900
The name's Ada.

195
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,960
we're after the same thing.

196
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,500
What?

197
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,280
Oh my god.

198
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,980
Why did it go purple?

199
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,020
What?

200
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,440
I thought it wasn't...

201
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
It faded me.

202
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,620
I thought it was purple.

203
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,620
I was like, oh, it's purple.

204
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,460
It's nothing.

205
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,700
I didn't go all the way.

206
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,060
I got it.

207
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,860
It's fine.

208
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,760
We got it.

209
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,740
We got it.

210
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,660
They didn't mean the thing.

211
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,660
I was like, oh, it's nothing.

212
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,560
Trash.

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Trash.

214
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,000
This is true.

215
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,980
I told you.

216
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,740
I told you, Chad, I could get it in four tries.

217
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,760
Finally, not hard pity.

218
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,300
Finally.

219
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,900
Oh my god, she was the last one too.

220
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,620
That purple is the lucky color.

221
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,360
Oh my god.

222
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,600
Let's check out Ada.

223
00:15:44,220 --> 00:16:45,300
operative who never reveals vulnerability no matter the circumstances Ada works alone stayed laser focused on her mission and keeping emotional ties at bay her true motives and identity and loyalty remains shrouded in secrecy even the name Ada won is just a an alias I can't believe it she baited oh my god there's her other oh there's them there's her other outfits I remember I don't remember this one but I remember this oh that's so cool there's her other like like uh resident evil outfits too wait she uses a bow that's interesting i thought she'd be like i thought she would use like her her uh pistol uh her pistol but like i mean it's cool because like i don't think any of the niki characters uses a bow too yeah it's an explosive uh crossbow too oh all right what is this oh okay the tv is cute i like i i think i love the Nikkei Chibis.

224
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,340
Yeah.

225
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,580
Oh, it's because like Jill uses a pistol.

226
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:59,340
I guess that makes sense because you know like they want to have like each character has their own um, has their own uh, guns, like different types of uh, weapon.

227
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,500
So like I guess it makes sense for her to have the explosive crossbow to differentiate.

228
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,660
I love the Chibis.

229
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,100
I think the Chibis are so cute.

230
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,400
Is that the hotel that D manages?

231
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,080

Wait, don't get to you missed something.

239
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,780

240
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,540
No, guys, we gotta move on.

241
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,420
Oh, yeah.

242
00:18:32,220 --> 00:19:06,340
I got really worried because I was like, you know, I've been very unlucky lately, so I was like, should I maybe I should farm some more gems just in case thank god I actually was farming gems um last night just in case just in case it did not take the it did not take two tries thank god because the last poll I did was literally all my free gems that was all it went to I assume the...

243
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,040
Oh, there it is.

244
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,320
So for the costume gotcha, you can pull it for the...

245
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,100
For the killer wave.

246
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,900
For the...

247
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,740
For...

248
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,280
Sorry, I lost my train of thought.

249
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,160
I don't know why.

250
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,780
For the new costume for the killer wave.

251
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,100
So it's the secret blue skin.

252
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,960
See, I'm wearing her hat right now.

253
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,140
And I'll have her baton stick.

254
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,740

Oh, yeah.

260
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,440
Is that a costume?

261
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,080
No!

262
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,080
That's a costume, right?

263
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,820
Well, I didn't know they could fit the entire costume in that briefcase, guys.

264
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,360
Oh, my God.

265
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,480
We got...

266
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,020
Oh, I could...

267
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,840
I mean, I could see it.

268
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,380
What's her...

269
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,220
killer wife.

270
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,600
I guess I have to go to the Pedia.

271
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,960
Uh, killer wife.

272
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,340
Umon.

273
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,120
This is what she looks like.

274
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,800
Wait, what does she looks like when she's shooting?

275
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,740
Oh, is it one shot?

276
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh, it is.

277
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, I forgot you can move him like this while shooting.

278
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,620
What about the chibi?

279
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh.

280
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:33,980
Okay.

281
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:35,980
Oh.

282
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,100
Oh, she's like a cross card for the special.

283
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,760
Oh, it's a sniper.

284
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,100
Okay, that makes sense.

285
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,180
I thought it would be like...

286
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,880
Because it doesn't look... I guess...

287
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,480
Okay, never mind.

288
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:50,740
I see.

289
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,300
I forgot.

290
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,740
This is the scope.

291
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,100
I was like, oh, it doesn't look like a sniper.

292
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,920
Nope, there's a giant-ass scope on top of it.

293
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,920
Yeah, she's a little traffic cop.

294
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,900
What else is the other one?

295
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,240
Okay, we'll look at Jill and Claire later.

296
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,160
All right, let's check out.

297
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,940
Guys, which one does the minigame?

298
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,940
I want to check out the Resident Evil minigame.

299
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,610
Great design personality is so evil.

300
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,450
I mean, if someone is named the killer wife, I would assume.

301
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:37,350
I would, you know, if their name is the killer wife, I would assume that they are not...

302
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:43,750
a good person, because I don't think a good person would name themselves Killer Wife.

303
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,170
Yeah, I heard the minigame is super addicting.

304
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,890
Now for, alright, let's check it out.

305
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,530
Apparently, you have to go through the story first for it.

306
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:03,710
Now, for the next report, over the past few days, a series of missing person cases have been reported across the arc.

307
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,350
The central government has issued an official statement.

308
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,930
saying that the incidents cannot be classified as serial disappearances.

309
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,230
Click, click.

310
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,010
Case number one.

311
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,130
Missing person, Miles Carter.

312
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,310
Mill, 45, former commander.

Last seen leaving his home around 11 p.m.

315
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,050
His daughter filed a report with the ACPU two days after his disappearance.

316
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,190
Notable information.

317
00:22:37,370 --> 00:23:53,090

319
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,630
Last seen around 10 a.m.

320
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,490
after leaving to a gathering with acquaintances.

321
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,750
Around 7 p.m.

322
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,350
on the same day, her son filed a report with the ACPU.

323
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,530
Authorities visited her residence immediately after the report was filled, but it was empty.

324
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,150
Preliminary findings that deceased I can't believe she's 68.

325
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,650
Suggest the entire family has gone missing.

326
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,290
Clay's classified as a family disappearance.

327
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,350
Notable information.

328
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,590
No signs of forced entry.

329
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,610
A rapture part was found in the basement.

330
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,990
A gathering of acquaintances?

331
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,930
Unable to verify details.

332
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,170
The rapture part was placed on some kind of altar.

333
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,550
For what purpose?

334
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,060
Conspiracy theory is suggesting that the groundwork is being laid for a second ARC terror attack.

335
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,080
Feeling widespread anxiety among the general populace.

336
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Click click.

337
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,860
Case number eight.

338
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,580
Oh my gosh, we're already at eight?

339
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,300
What happened to the other numbers?

340
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,640
Missing person.

341
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,660
Elzeria nine.

342
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,620
I swear, she's like 95 or something.

343
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:35,600
Female.

344
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,240
Okay, sorry.

345
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,620
42 is still pretty.

346
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,960
Oh my god, what is going on in this world of Niki?

347
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,830
And where can I get in it?

348
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
Psychological counselor.

349
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,820
167 CM, 55 KGU.

350
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,380
Exact time of disappearance.

351
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,060
Unknown.

352
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,200
What are they feeding them?

353
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,140
Reported missing to the ACPU by our last client.

354
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,020
Noble information.

355
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:40,380
operated a counseling center confirmed to be same center where Miles Carter underwent counseling has a daughter named de para no contact with the daughter as of yet also missing why did the daughter fail to report her mother's disappear yeah that is pretty weird your mom's missing why did you not report anything do you not love her click This is not good.

356
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,060
Holi puts the pen down.

357
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,020
Ah.

358
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,680
Well, these eyes shift from the case file to the computer monitor beside her.

359
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,560
At a partisan, partition, leading to the outer rim.

360
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,720
They have a drug in the art called evergreen or eternal life that slows down aging.

361
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,240
That's why Ingrid looks in her 30s despite being in her...

362
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,380
What?

363
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,360
Yo, thank you for the super chat.

364
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:12,820
Thank you.

365
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,640
Thank you.

366
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,240
Oh my god, the wonder.

367
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,460
I was like, oh my, this is a 65 year old nurse.

368
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,660
First off, you are in a very stressful environment.

369
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,740
The face of the girl captured on CCTV was...

370
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
Dei Parra.

371
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,200
Oh, it's the daughter.

372
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,660
Oh, she...

373
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,640
Oh, I like her outfit.

374
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,720
I really like her outfit.

375
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,480
like her outfit.

376
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,940
Girl, I don't know if you're evil or not, but you're...

377
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,600
You have good fashion sense.

378
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,980
That is a nice outfit.

379
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,860
It was unmistakably a day para.

380
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,600
As identified in the file for case number eight.

381
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,350
Your fit is fire, though.

382
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,770
This is the only lead we've got.

383
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,710
Can't afford to lose this trail now.

384
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,090
Right.

385
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,270
Can't afford to lose this trail at all.

386
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,130
I'm gonna like the self.

387
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm gonna save it I'm gonna I'm gonna save your fit real quick

388
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:39,430
Okay, Polly grabs her side art Hope it's I hope there's nothing serious Yoink she sets off from the police station

389
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,550
Missing pretty what?

390
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,590
Come on!

391
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,150
Wait, we were just with her!

392
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,470
Where did she go?

393
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,690
She was just there!

394
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,530
ECPU investigate.

395
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,770
She's just gone, I guess.

396
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,130
She's...

397
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,810
Went missing during the investigation.

398
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,510
Did she get lost in the way?

399
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,510
Like, do we have a GPS on her?

400
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,410
Where's her tracking?

401
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,230
Wait, if she's a Niki, don't we have, like, a tracker tag on her?

402
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,270
I don't know.

403
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:47,890
I feel like, if, you know, when you have like cyborg like you know you know cyborg slash android's i feel like you put a tracker on them like a find your iphone find your nikki yeah i feel like that would be smart right like an air tag find your nikki i must find these people cut to the person being missing confirm last scene I feel like that would make sense,

404
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,230
right?

405
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,750
Have a fine Unique?

406
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,130
All signs point to her pursuing Dapara alone.

407
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,270
Notable information.

408
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,950
Confirmed I visited a counseling center operated by 9 on the day of her disappearance.

409
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,710
The center is currently decommissioned.

410
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,110
Entry is not permitted.

411
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,150
Recently, a phrase has been reported to be circulating among the staff.

412
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:23,790
umbrella will pave the way for it for us oh my god that's where umbrella comes in wait does that mean umbrella has their own nikki as well

413
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,430
freeborn evil

414
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,130
oh we're in the mansion oh that's so cool

415
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:54,110
all right story one i assume is challenge oh wait wait what's this Touch your salvation doctrine.

416
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,010
You who have lost your way need not grieve.

417
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,810
The judge already guides humanity towards salvation.

418
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,270
Foolish human.

419
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,590
Do not resist.

420
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,970
Oh, there's a typewriter!

421
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,130
I can log in.

422
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,570
Okay, I'll claim it.

423
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:14,790
Yoink.

424
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,950
Mine now.

425
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,990
There's like supply blocks.

426
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,050
What's this?

427
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,670
Suspicious area.

428
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,030
What's over here?

429
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,320
I assume...

430
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,660
Okay.

431
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,040
I have to reach chapter 5.

432
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,920
Oh, is Claire in here?

433
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,460
Is she in here?

434
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,380
Where is she?

435
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,820
Oh, it's for mats.

436
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,220
Okay.

437
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:53,940
No.

438
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh, it's like part of the...

439
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Oh, she's the login bonus.

440
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,100
Let me check.

441
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,100
I want to look at it.

442
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,540
Oh, there she is.

443
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,400
Okay, it's the third day.

444
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,120
Claire Redfield is a college student who ventured into Raccoon City to find her brother, Chris.

445
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,500
She's one of the few survivors of the Raccoon City incident.

446
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,240
One of the deadliest pandemics in history.

447
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,920
Okay, so it's on the third day.

448
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,900
So on your third login, you should be able to get...

449

This is why I also farmed.

452
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,100
Where's Ada?

453
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,940
Exactly why I farmed.

454
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,700
There we go.

455
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,860
That's right.

456
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,120
Eat up, Ada.

457
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,420
Yum, yum.

458
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,920
Eat up.

459
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,660
I do.

460
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,400
I farmed it just for this.

461
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,940
Alright, also I gotta grab the outpost real quick.

462
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,540
Eat up, girl.

463
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,420
I got fattened you up.

464
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:38,760
Alright.

465
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,920
So you can be big and strong like all my other Nikes.

466
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,800
You gotta be strong for me.

467
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,620
Exclamation point feed.

468
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay, nice.

469
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,200
I want to see if I'm stronger than before.

470
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,900
Care to take a little...

471
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,820
Om yam yam yam.

472
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,640
Okay, now we can go back in.

473
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,140
All right, now we can go in just in case.

474
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,480
All right, five out of five.

475
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,720
Enter.

476
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,240
Event number one.

477
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,380
Can I auto?

478
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,180
Okay, auto.

479
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,220
Wait, what about Ada?

480
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,560
Get out of here!

481
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,760
Ada only!

482
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,740
What if I just...

483
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,320
What if?

484
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,020
Wait, can I send just her in?

485
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
Wait, I can!

486
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,260
Wait, it's possible.

487
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,560
This is my Ada only run.

488
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
Right on time.

489
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,980
Take a seat.

490
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,180
I heard a D-wave was detected.

491
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes.

492
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,160
It was two weeks ago.

493
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,280
A D-wave triggered by the entity code named Gatekeeper was picked up.

494
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,740
Two weeks ago, you said?

495
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:27,740
Why wasn't I notified immediately we have to confirm a few things the d wave wasn't detected on the surface this time it came from inside the arc huh we're presently picking up d-wave signals from a mansion located in the elder rim if we move too hastily there's a risk of the d-wave being exposed external priorities.

496
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:36,540
This could reignite tensions with the Elder Rim, especially since the dust has only just settled from the last Elder Rim incident.

497
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,680
As such, the central government has decided to handle this case with extreme caution.

498
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,540
Which brings me to my point.

499
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,580
Have you ever heard of the Torch of Salvation?

500
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,840
The Torch of Salvation?

501
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,520
I've heard it before when I was working for a case helping that girl, Deepara, searched for a mother.

502
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,400
Aren't they the cult that worships raptures as gods?

503
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,460
It seems you're well informed.

504
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,620
Take a look at this.

505
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,540
Anderson hands me a document.

506
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,520
The document reads, Human life falls into oblivion, throwing a world into turmoil.

507
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,080
New life has been created, a cruel distortion of all things sacred.

508
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,200
Merciless judges descend from the sky.

509
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,440
Do not resist why thy feeble human strength.

510
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,260
The end is nigh.

511
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,140
God.

512
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,040
Guide these foolish mortals to their reckoning.

513
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,820
Is this a prayer?

514
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,620
Where did we recover this near the mansion where the D-wave was detected.

515
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:03,160
It's supposedly a prayer recited at the touch at the torch of salvation, gathering, and also, that mansion has been identified as a gathering site for the Torch of Salvation.

516
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,260
We shouldn't go charging in head first, unless we want a complete fiasco on our hands.

517
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,040
The most reliable method is to infiltrate their ranks by posing as a believer.

518
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,200
That's why we spent the past two weeks gathering all available intel on the Torch of Salvation.

519
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:21,820
Yay!

520
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,580
We're going to join a cult!

521
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:59,480
trade undercover we're gonna be so undercover we're very good at being undercover cops remember guys what your task is simple memorize the materials we've compiled disguise yourself as a believer of the torch yeah disguise wow sir how did you know that's what my favorite uh my favorite groups my favorite my favorite book club then enter the mansion investigate the or guided the D wave.

522
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,680
While you're there, resolve any related incidents you encounter.

523
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,120
You want me to go undercover?

524
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,200
I've heard a lot about your infiltration skills.

525
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,720
Where it is, you use that skill to close the book on several major cases.

526
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,700
We're counting on you to put those skills to get used once more.

527
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,140
Just so you know, the counters won't be a you on this mission.

528
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,660
Moving around the outer rim with such prominent individuals poses too great a risk.

529
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,860
Instead, we've arranged a separate support group.

530
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,940
Return to the commander's room.

531
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,880
You'll meet them there.

532
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,080
They'll brief you on the remaining mission details.

533
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,450
Deputy Chief, are you saying?

534
00:38:54,990 --> 00:39:24,270
that'll be all i have a very important meeting to attend well then i look forward to hearing good news from you all right yay i get to go to a book club all right aida no you got this my aida only run if she's op These guys are quite persistent.

535
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,510
I know, right, Ada?

536
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,330
If only you had backup.

537
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,870
Wait, actually, what am I doing?

538
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,310
Oh.

539
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,030
Oh, shoot.

540
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,550
This is starting to get old.

541
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,530
What am I doing?

542
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,330
Ada only, baby.

543
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,930
Let's go.

544
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,930
What do you mean?

545
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,310
She's literally full HP.

546
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,410
She is the backup.

547
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,330
Look at that.

548
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,030
It's fine.

549
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,070
They do, like, one damage to her.

550
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,890
No, that's...

551
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,850
The lure.

552
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,470
She's a solo act.

553
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,610
Next mission together.

554
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,450
Alright.

555
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,470
Yeah, she has AoE.

556
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:11,950
Oh, nice.

557
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,930
I got mixed herbs.

558
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,210
That's good.

559
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,010
Slow and steady wins the race.

560
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,110
Zing.

561
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,430
He said to meet them back at the commanders room.

562
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,470
but

563
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:54,070
it's awfully quiet in there guess I'll just sit and wait I sink into the couch and everything Anderson just told me comes flooding back the D wave the outer rim the mansion and the torch of salvation my favorite book club never thought I thought I hear that name again.

564
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,650
They got a little too serious with their books, so I had to leave.

565
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,750
A memory of something I saw on the surface hits me abruptly.

566
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,770
A small altar in the middle of a clearing and a blade of unknown purpose.

567
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,710
People lying around as if they're asleep.

568
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,490
Each of them holding a rapture part in their hands.

569
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,730
I realize I've been entrusted with a mission far greater than I anticipated.

570
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,950
My mind is racing.

571
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,490
Maybe a splash of water would help clear my head.

572
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,680
Drip, drip.

573
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
The sound of a running faucet can be heard from the bathroom.

574
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,720
I forgot to turn off the water?

575
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,320
Silly me.

576
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,600
A rapi finds out wait, intruder?

577
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,100
Drip?

578
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,400
Oh my god.

579
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,700
Aggressive drip.

580
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,380
Drip.

581
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,300
Drip.

582
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:50,980
Drip, drip.

583
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,540
Huh?

584
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:25,660
My nose burns i glanced at the mirror and see blood flowing just like the people i saw near the altar back then it's scary drip drip drip drip drip no not the scary drip blood fills the sink oh my god did she just come out of my Where did she come from?

585
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,180
How did she get here?

586
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,820
Aren't you being a bit traumatic?

587
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,340
Wait, there's more than her?

588
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,680
I thought you'd be used to you'd be used to this by now.

589
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,820
Wait, how did she get here?

590
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,820
From my shower?

591
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,240
Huff.

592
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,100
Huff.

593
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,400
What the?

594
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,740
Hey, you okay?

595
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,760
The blood that filled the sink has completely vanished.

596
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:55,400
I danced back in the mirror again d oh my god is that d killer wife d and k are standing behind me yeah i'm fine wait what's in the back it's moving so you are no that's regular d no just d wait there's more than oh d original oh so it's like d killer wife is like the upgrade of d or is it like d but eviler yeah oh so it's evil d it's like her evil twin so you're you all are the backup Anderson was talking about we'll wait outside pull yourself together and come out when you're ready d the regular government worker hi this is d the white collar the white collar office worker and then D,

597
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,620
killer white.

598
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,400
As missing persons, reports continue to pour in.

599
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:12,080
The central government has stated it will take firm action against those who spread false information.

600
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,700
D and double D.

601
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,660
After watching my face, I stepped out and see the news is on.

602
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,700
D is leaning against the wall with her arms crossed.

603
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,680
K is sprawled out on the couch.

604
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,660
They're watching the news.

605
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:59,180
with grim expressions these days all you hear on TV are stories about people going missing I was told to get submission details directly from both of you stop read that first we'll talk after he tosses a stack of documents onto a table then glances back at the news broadcast looks like I won't get a word out of her until I'm finished with the entire pile.

606
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:08,400
At the very top of the stack of documents, it reads, Case number one, Missing Person, Miles Carter.

607
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,760
Oh, I read this already.

608
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,440
I guess that was like from the intro, I guess from Polly's perspective.

609
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,560
You're a fast reader.

610
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,720
Now tell me, what exactly is happening in the arc?

611
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,160
As the question hangs in the air, what is in your bag?

612
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,640
It's like moving on its own.

613
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,380
Are you sure you're not D-Killer wife?

614
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,880
My eyes remain fixed on the last page of the document.

615
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,920
Case number nine.

616
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,560
Missing person, Paulie.

617
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,980
Central government is trying to keep it hush-hush.

618
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,360
Plus, as you've just seen, there's been a string of disappearances inside the arc.

619
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,440
The missing persons are all of different ages, genders, and backgrounds.

620
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,950
One of them is even Anike.

621
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,780
At first glance, that doesn't seem to be any obvious links between them.

622
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,010
Case slides a document towards me.

623
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,350
Case number eight.

624
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,670
Missing person, Elseria 9.

625
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,950
Noble information has a daughter named Deepara.

626
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:32,430
According to central government records, Deepara's mother, Elseria 9, was involved with a cult called the Torch of Salvation.

627
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,910
So, I poked around the counseling center she ran.

628
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:44,670
It turns out every single missing person is somehow connected to that place.

629
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:47,990
For example, this guy.

630
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,210
Miles Carter.

631
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,670
Turns out he was going there for counseling.

632
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,170
Ars Monroe used to work there as a nurse.

633
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:30,850
Not only that, enough you don't have to spell everything out it's all in the documents that I just made him read stupid if if you say so anyway here's the bottom line every one of the missing it is tied to Saria 9 which brings us to the problem she's part of a cult that worships raptures so So,

634
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,890
here's where the D-Wave is coming from.

635
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:39,950
The first person to go missing, Mouse Carter, vanished two weeks ago.

636
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,710
Strangely enough, we picked a D-Wave coming from the other rim two weeks ago as well.

637
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,770
Right at the mansion where the torch of salvation holds is scattering.

638
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,610
Something about this reeks, wouldn't you agree?

639
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,410
cases, the D-Wave and the Torch of Salvation.

640
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,470
Is this Transcendental connected?

641
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:09,590
That's right.

642
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,210
This mission's a lot more complex than the last.

643
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,410
We gotta figure out why the D-Wave is being detected from the mansion.

644
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:21,850
Get to the bottom of how it ties into the disappearance.

645
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,650
Verify the identities of all the missing.

646
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,990
And on top of everything else, rescue them if possible.

647
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,530
Wait, and they're coming with me right?

648
00:48:30,550 --> 00:49:00,930
right naturally if we uncover anything else felonious on the torch of salvation while we're at it we'll have to decide whether or not to eliminate them simple enough so torch of salvation are our target this time around huh okay thank god i was gonna be like are they just sending me by myself like you have guns that's what we were told usual,

649
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,190
you and D will handle the infiltration.

650
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,070
Just pose as...

651
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:06,070
Oh!

652
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,690
That's my killer wife!

653
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:15,370
Just pose as a married couple who have been brainwashed by the cult and attend one of their gatherings.

654
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,930
Oh my god, score!

655
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,490
And what will you be doing?

656
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,430
I'll go solo again this time.

657
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,330
I've got a bad feeling about something.

658
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,530
So I want to look into it first.

659
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:39,190
All right, now that you've been briefed on the mission, Lop, start by memorizing what's written there.

660
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,550
V tosses another stack of documents onto a table, then turns back to the news broadcast.

661
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,150
Once again, it seems she won't say another word until I read through everything.

662
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,330
Just from skimming through, it looks like this is a backstory of the couple we're supposed to play.

663
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:00,530
Rather than have a backstory, why can't we just, you know, make it up as we go along?

664
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:04,290
What do you mean to memorize all of this?

665
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,530
I'm off to handle some stuff.

666
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,410
We could improv.

667
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,110
We're good improvers.

668
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,510
Let's give this all or all.

669
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,550
Yeah, you know, we should actually get married for actual immersion too.

670
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:30,310
What did they check our tax records as a married couple?

671
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,190
We have to share bank accounts as well.

672
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:39,890
What if we check our marital records?

673
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,310
We gotta commit.

674
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,270
All right, nice.

675
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,050
We cleared it.

676
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:50,910
All right, okay, guys.

677
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,390
I don't think I can...

678
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:57,410
All right, unfortunately, it seems like it won't let me do a solo run of Ada.

679
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,430
Looks like you could use some help.

680
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,430
All right, let's do this.

681
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,230
I think, guys, you think we're gonna beat the stage?

682
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,010
Man, I hope we can beat the stage, guys.

683
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:11,550
I'm just...

684
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,730
I hope we can make it.

685
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,950
Oh my god, they died before they can spawn on my screen.

686
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,150
God, I'm so good at this game.

687
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:31,850
Um, hello?

688
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,830
I am spectating Ada 1.

689
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:35,290
Get out of here.

690
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:38,370
Nice.

691
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:45,250
I should start preparing for the next class.

692
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:45,530
Yay!

693
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,430
More mixed herbs.

694
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,630
I'm so good at Niki.

695
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,890
Wow, that was so close, guys.

696
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,310
What a close game.

697
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,340
Their husband and wife.

698
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,840
Both of them come from the Quadidian class.

699
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,280
And have been living a fairly uneventful life in the Ark.

700
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,020
Anette works as a nurse.

701
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,000
On the other hand, her husband...

702
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,540
Speaking of which, what alias should I use this time?

703
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh my god, does she have a barcode?

704
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,160
Can I scan it?

705
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,480
William, I believe.

706
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,760
You should be able to come up with something on your own.

707
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:39,980
Oh, sorry.

708
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,860
Go on.

709
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,140
Her husband William is a researcher at a pharmaceutical company.

710
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:52,840
Despite the couple's busy schedule, they never forget to shower each other with attention.

711
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,920
Everyone around them speaks highly about how happy their marriage seems.

712
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,660
You're home.

713
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,480
You must have had a long day.

714
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,160
Yeah, my wife carries her gun with her all the time, guys.

715
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,280
Yeah, you too.

716
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,980
You must have a long day yourself.

717
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:47,780
darling not at all oh what's that honey oh these they're uh the flowers are absolutely beautiful oh right the flowers I thought you on the way home so I picked them up thank you she loves nothing more than flowers from her husband That part of the script never seems to change no matter what role I play.

718
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,160
Honey?

719
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,700
It's nothing.

720
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,800
Then one day, calamity befalls the couple.

721
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,840
A medical accident occurs at William's pharmacy.

722
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,320
Oh my god, did she write this fan fiction?

723
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,920
Like who wrote this script?

724
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,320
I need to know who wrote this script for us.

725
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,300
She is so immersed.

726
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,580
A medical instant accident occurs at William's pharmaceutical company.

727
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:24,160
All the blame is pinned entirely on poor William.

728
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,400
The couple suddenly becomes buried in debt.

729
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,560
And their idyllic life collapses overnight.

730
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,980
When she actually wrote this script.

731
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:36,140
Oh my god.

732
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,760
Despite this, Anna never blames William.

733
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,700
Instead, it's all right.

734
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,440
What happened?

735
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,020
Wasn't your fault.

736
00:54:45,040 --> 00:55:16,540
fault honey it's the world that's gone crazy um if like i messed up in a pharmaceutical company that means some people might have died um but don't worry my wife doesn't think it's my fault that's okay it's the world's fault don't worry the judges will be sent from a book to guide everyone towards the end they begin to blame the world for turning its back on them Don't worry about it.

737
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,620
Yeah, it's not me, it's everyone else's fault.

738
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,340
Soon, the couple became devoted to the torch of salvation.

739
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,520
With their fate deepened, the couple decided to attend a gathering, reportedly being held at a certain mansion.

740
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,490
Wait, so, oh, I was like the fall guy.

741
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,670
Oh, so I was just a low-ranker.

742
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,130
Let's quietly head for the outer rim.

743
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,510
Yeah, I want to see Dee's fanfiction account.

744
00:55:48,630 --> 00:56:19,590
even bring this is way too professional of a script it has like everything like backstory my likes and dislikes my like literally this her likes and dislikes my daily routine with my wife they even bring a bouquet of flowers hoping to be welcomed as initiates into the fate the residential area near the mansion is eerily quiet It's rather unsettling.

745
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:22,710
It's like there's no one around at all.

746
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:26,310
Only pages filled where prayer scripts are scattered about.

747
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,030
There's no sign of life anywhere.

748
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,870
Kay and I were digging around.

749
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,050
This area was crawling with cultists.

750
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,390
So what now, darling?

751
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:42,050
Let's start by checking out the area.

752
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,650
Given the situation, I think we can drop the act.

753
00:56:47,310 --> 00:57:20,010
yeah yeah act act yeah of course of course the end I split up to look around well there are signs someone's living here recently the place itself is completely empty the only thing worth noting is some sort of graffiti has been scrawled all over the walls is that an umbrella wait where why would someone draw something like that there does it mean anything I stared at the umbrella graffiti for a while,

754
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,630
but it offers no answers.

755
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,910
Nike, search up umbrella corporation.

756
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:33,290
I turn my head and see the mansion looming in the distance.

757
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:38,190
And the moment I saw it, the mansion felt like it didn't belong in the outer rim.

758
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:45,790
I feel like if I don't know what it is, wouldn't there be like a Nike equivalent of a search engine?

759
00:57:45,790 --> 00:58:19,570
and be like reverse image search this reverse image search by this umbrella what's a perfectly intact mansion like this doing in the other room you ask like they can invent the fountain of youth but they can't invent a find my Nikkei tracker chip where's my find my Nikkei phone app beats me yeah A strange rumor has been spreading in the outer rim.

760
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,470
Wuckles warns others not to go near the mansion.

761
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:29,030
Stay far away from the mansion unless you want misfortune to come your way.

762
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,590
Maybe that's why it's so intact.

763
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:37,010
I feel like that's the first thing I would invent to capitalize on the Nikkei's running around.

764
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,210
I'd be like, have you ever wondered where your Nikkei went off to?

765
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,250
You lost your Nikkei and you don't know where she is.

766
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,210
App for you.

767
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,970
Find my Niki.

768
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,570
This place gives me the creeps.

769
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,430
Maybe I should have head to where D is.

770
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,430
I'm pretty sure I saw her heading that way earlier.

771
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:09,930
D?

772
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,290
You here?

773
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,210
Sorry.

774
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,070
I didn't realize...

775
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:23,570
Oh!

776
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,570
In there?

777
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:26,290
Okay.

778
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:28,470
I didn't realize you were changing.

779
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:32,230
I am slipping something that would be easier to move around in.

780
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:32,630
Whoops.

781
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:33,490
Sorry.

782
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:34,870
My bad.

783
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,490
No point in pretending that we're a couple at this point.

784
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,770
So, did you see anything?

785
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,110
I noticed some strange graffiti drawn all over the place.

786
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,090
But, other than that, nothing unusual.

787
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,230
Nothing out of the ordinary?

788
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,470
That makes all even more suspicious.

789
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:19,470
I hear a door opening I hear a door opening behind me He has changed back into her usual outfit Hmm Doesn't look like there's anything else to learn here Let's head to the mansion If I have any luck You might find some sort of lead

790
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:47,680
Target located Ada There she is That's my girl keep up your end of the bargain and i'll do the same there she is oh my god it's her clean up neatly and beautiful oh my god wait i okay i was gonna say where's where's the rest of my team i

791
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:32,280
hey hey i don't want to look at you it's ada day get out of here it's like pushing that sheep away it's not you it's her not bad yay i did it next mission together the game knows it's only ada the mansion is heavily guarded there's no way to sneak in ada is practically my entire team the only way we can get inside without causing a scene citing this prayer to prove we are believers.

792
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,940
Memorize all of this from top to bottom.

793
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,680
And don't even think about complaining.

794
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,600
Again?

795
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:47,860
Look, I know that for you, you can just delete hard drive and recycle and trash, but this is a lot harder to memorize.

796
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,240
I spend the whole night memorizing everything.

797
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,780
Just as Dee had told me.

798
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,940
Oh my god, I'm so whipped.

799
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,440
Unfortunately, I never get to use what I memorized.

800
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,300
Contrary to what Dee told me getting into the mansion end up being extremely easy.

801
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:03,780
Yeah, I know.

802
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,900
She's like, it's heavily guarded.

803
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,700
I was like, where?

804
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,400
Especially since there wasn't even any security.

805
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:15,940
Wait, you lied.

806
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,900
Much like the residential district, the mansion is deserted.

807
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,980
Well, you said it was guarded.

808
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,540
What did I memorize?

809
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:56,360
Aside from the ominous creaking of the floorboards, under my feet absolutely nothing else could be heard looks like this place is empty too k and i scoped out the mansion surrounding only two days ago what the heck happened between then and now did they did they catch wind of us snooping around i don't know you're you're holding a giant axe i think we look very suspicious

810
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:08,720
know i feel like we sort of look very suspicious d i won't be surprised i but if that was so

811
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:29,960
d it seems whatever i'm saying now is not getting through to d i leave d to your thoughts and start surveying the lobby in the center of the lobby i step carefully past a shattered chandelier and spot a half-destroyed statue of a goddess.

812
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:38,820
The moment I approached the creepy statue, I noticed a long trail of red stains stretching down the hallway.

813
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,360
D, you might want to see this.

814
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,100
The trail of blood leads straight into the dining room.

815
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,900
Oh, is that where...

816
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,200
Maybe... Maybe Claire?

817
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,340
What a mess.

818
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:52,980
Or Polly?

819
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:53,820
Maybe?

820
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,820
You can say that again.

821
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,040
The dining room is in complete disarray.

822
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,140
We've rotten food scattered everywhere.

823
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,940
Yet the foul stench lingering in the air was not coming from spoiled food.

824
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,140
It was coming from somewhere else instead.

825
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,440
I'll go check it out on my own.

826
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,980
No, let's go together.

827
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,700
The blood trail winds past the dining table.

828
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,840
Oh, a secret, a secret entrance.

829
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,660
At the end of the trail?

830
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,080
There's a corpse.

831
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,520
The body has been horribly mangled.

832
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,540
Oh, zombies?

833
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,600
The blood hasn't even dried up yet.

834
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,920
It's clear this just happened.

835
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,620
Oh, what in the world is going on here?

836
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:47,980
Suddenly.

837
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,180
I feel something cold pressed.

838
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,240
Oh, that has to be Ada.

839
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:54,520
I knew it.

840
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,540
I could see it.

841
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,060
I could see the red.

842
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,680
Lower your weapon.

843
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,020
It's best you don't do anything foolish.

844
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,020
That is.

845
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,920
If you want to keep him alive.

846
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,540
Identify yourself.

847
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:12,720
FBI.

848
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,000
But I suppose you wouldn't know what that is.

849
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,820
Wait, is this like a...

850
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,640
Uh, sorry.

851
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,860
But who I am is classified.

852
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:23,800
I was going to say FBI.

853
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,380
FBI in the Niki universe?

854
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,700
I was like, did they like like jump from an alternate dimension?

855
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,720
Here's a friendly tip though.

856
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:43,080
Stop asking questions and get out of here while you still can.

857
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:51,560
Yeah, I was gonna say, did like a portal open up or something and there was like a time like a, what's the word called?

858
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,620
When they accidentally cross cross between dimensions a time rift or something

859
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,210
i was gonna i was thinking like maybe i can solo this

860
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:41,140
oh that's what the d wave is oh it pulls people from different universes into it oh i see oh so it's like yeah dimensions cross it's time i teach all of you a lesson you'll have to take it from here we got this Ada you're so good hey get out of here I don't even know you're gonna get out of here this is the Ada Wong show

861
01:06:45,290 --> 01:07:04,390
yeah the D stands for doki the doki waves that's why I'm always here whenever there's a collab I am most pleased with it alright I believe finishing one five Unlocks the... Finishing 1.5 Unlocks the minigame, right?

862
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,930
Because I want to try the minigame out as soon as I can.

863
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,850
Because I heard it's really, really fun.

864
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:15,380
Hmm.

865
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,260
Hmm.

866
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,800
Ren, are you alright?

867
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:30,000
Hmm?

868
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,260
Yeah, of course.

869
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,760
I was just using my usual firearms check.

870
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,500
And this hour The work day's over.

871
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:45,960
An ACUP works for our citizens around the clock.

872
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,280
How is that?

873
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,700
Did it sound cool?

874
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,260
Not really.

875
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,440
I don't think that's something you should be seeing in this situation.

876
01:07:58,860 --> 01:07:59,740
Is that so?

877
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,780
Cherish your gun like you would a loved one.

878
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
What about that?

879
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,540
It doesn't quite fit the situation either.

880
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,380
Oh, really?

881
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,160
Then...

882
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,580
Oh.

883
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,280
Darn, this isn't good.

884
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,300
Officially out of excuses!

885
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,420
Hang on.

886
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:32,200
We're not planning on waiting until I'm off duty and then heading to the other rim, are you?

887
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,080
The boss already told us.

888
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:46,740
Since there's no way HQ is ever going to authorize an investigation, we've been told to stand by for now.

889
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,400
Are you still investigating, aren't you, Query?

890
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:58,260
Well, Query quickly shuts the file folder she's carrying.

891
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,260
Document she was reading is late.

892
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,420
Oh, that's the Polly case.

893
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,100
I can't sit and do nothing.

894
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,440
but I have to head out to the outer rim to find Polly.

895
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,920
But we be defying orders.

896
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,160
Find by Mimi.

897
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,760
No Niki left behind.

898
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,700
I've gotten used to filling out disciplinary reports.

899
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,580
10 pages.

900
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,500
Damn.

901
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,340
I mean six pages.

902
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,460
No, three pages.

903
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,080
I can fill that out in my sleep.

904
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,160
I think we'd be in for more than just a disciplinary report.

905
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:46,760
Oh, even better.

906
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,280
Then I won't have to write one at all.

907
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:54,140
No, and what I'm saying is...

908
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,060
Besides, Polly would have done the same for us.

909
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,040
Hurry turns the white bard, placed in the corner of the police station.

910
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,820
Her vision is too blurry to make out what's written on it.

911
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:14,080
But the photo of Polly pinned at the center of the board stood out perfectly clear to her.

912
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,820
All right, I'm off.

913
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,660
Miranda, yes, I'm coming with you.

914
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,540
Yay, teamwork makes the dream work.

915
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,120
So, what's our first course of action?

916
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,460
Oh, are you asking me?

917
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,000
Just you and me, so who else would I be asking?

918
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,220
And no more jumping out of shadows like last time, okay?

919
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,440
It honestly scared me to death when you do.

920
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,460
So what you're telling me is you came out of here without a plan?

921
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,260
Well, this is where Polly's...

922
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,220
Oh, there it is!

923
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,320
Find my Niki!

924
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,320
I knew it!

925
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:02,580
I was like, how could they not have that?

926
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,080
There it is!

927
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,060
And then the family died.

928
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,760
This is where Polly's signal was last detected.

929
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,300
Oh, why don't we start searching around this area?

930
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,860
Also, is it just me, or does this place feel kind of creepy?

931
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,360
This isn't raising a soul around.

932
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,320
I hate it when my phone runs out of battery so you can't find my neat game.

933
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,940
Hey, do you see that?

934
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,980
There's a mansion over there.

935
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,370
Let's check it out.

936
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,610
This is the ACUP.

937
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,690
We're coming in.

938
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:00,690
Moran and Yanks open the front door and stride confidently through.

939
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,990
Oh, we really shouldn't be barging.

940
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:05,290
Oh my gosh, he's scared.

941
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:07,710
You are in the police force.

942
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,850
You have a rocket as a gun.

943
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,170
We should really...

944
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,170
Shouldn't be...

945
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:20,450
Be paging in like this.

946
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,130
ACOP open up.

947
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,210
As the front door opened.

948
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:27,910
She has a rocket!

949
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:28,830
Has a gun!

950
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:30,890
Why is she scared?

951
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,550
What's that?

952
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:40,910
She couldn't be any more prepared for this situation.

953
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,630
Encouraged hazy field of vision.

954
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:47,830
shapes appear.

955
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,050
Is it the dogs?

956
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,130
That's not, that's not Polly!

957
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,020
Oh my god, evil dogs.

958
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,500
Three dogs lunges towards them.

959
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,480
Their eyes glow as sinister red as if infected by something.

960
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,400
Where did it come from?

961
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,380
Woof, woof.

962
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,800
Uh, just as the largest one appears, it's jaws.

963
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:25,700
Bang.

964
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,420
Oh, it's chilling.

965
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,060
Did they shoot that dog?

966
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,100
Two women appear from behind.

967
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,320
Bang, bang.

968
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,820
One of them fires a launch.

969
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:36,920
What?

970
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,360
Okay, no.

971
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,040
They caught.

972
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:40,920
Okay, never mind.

973
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,400
They shot the air.

974
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,880
I was like, not the dogs.

975
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:48,380
They were about to kill them, but not the dogs.

976
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:53,710
Oh.

977
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:54,750
Oh.

978
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,150
You okay?

979
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:57,990
You okay?

980
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,970
Thanks a bunch.

981
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,610
But who are you?

982
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:07,410
I should be asking you the same thing.

983
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,850
What the hell is this place?

984
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,570
And who are you people?

985
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:14,950
Is that a rocket for a gun?

986
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:20,810
I will...

987
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:25,970
I cannot get over the fact that she's literally holding a giant-ass rocket.

988
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,210
I feel like Jill and Claire should be more concerned about that.

989
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,410
Be like, what is that?

990
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,590
Like, what are you holding?

991
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:41,230
Yay!

992
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:43,110
Kablui!

993
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:46,330
My little mermaid did it.

994
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,010
I knew I could always count on you.

995
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,030
Hold the door.

996
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:55,310
We gotta keep them out.

997
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,290
Oh my gosh, we're in our little...

998
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:06,230

It's feeding time!

1004
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:50,590
I think they're all gone now.

1005
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:57,670
I thought the gunfire scared some of them off, but they brought friends instead.

1006
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:02,150
They're like, we rolled up with reinforcements!

1007
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:03,150
Woof!

1008
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:07,150
If we arrived any later, things could have been a disaster.

1009
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:11,390
Yeah, that was too close for comfort.

1010
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,370
He wants his food.

1011
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:19,570
Anyway, now that things have calmed down, let's get some proper introduction going.

1012
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:20,890
I'm Claire.

1013
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,130
Claire Redfield.

1014
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,810
I'm Quarry from...

1015
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:26,530
Oh, it's ACPU.

1016
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:31,590
I was thinking of ICUP.

1017
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:32,690
I...

1018
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,570
I was like, damn, we changed one letter in the ICUP.

1019
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:38,410
But it's ACPU.

1020
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:38,910
You.

1021
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:39,830
Okay.

1022
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:41,290
ACPU.

1023
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,490
I was like, A cup.

1024
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:50,080

And this here is I'm Miranda.

1026
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,320
Also with the A cup.

1027
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,300
ACPU.

1028
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,100
ACPU.

1029
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:07,630
The ACPU?

1030
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,430
That's right.

1031
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:13,690
We're the police safeguarding citizens.

1032
01:18:16,070 --> 01:19:08,810
that's what the ACPU does so you're both police officers then have you heard of a man called Chris he really likes punching boulders you can't miss him he's my he's my brother he works for the Raccoon City Police Department I haven't been able to reach him so I've been looking for him the Raccoon City Police department border I'm not too sure have you heard of that query no this is my first time hearing about this department seems close for this man Chris I see it's a pity

Literally, like, absorbed the entire mansion.

1036
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:22,090
You too?

1037
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:26,250
I was trying to escape Raccoon City when everything started going blurry too.

1038
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,010
Or D-Wave.

1039
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,550
Before I knew it, I saw two of them getting attacked.

1040
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:35,370
I just reacted and sprang into action.

1041
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,660
What the hell happened to us?

1042
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:45,960
Alright.

1043
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,740
the minigame unlocked now?

1044
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Enter.

1045
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,760
Oh, wait, back.

1046
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,440
It's so dark in here.

1047
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:56,500
Oh, hey, there's Quarry.

1048
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,840
Oh, there it is.

1049
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,080
The broken golden goddess statue.

1050
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,060
I assume this is the minigame.

1051
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:04,820
Also, sleazy.

1052
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,400
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

1053
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:06,800
Thank you.

1054
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:07,720
Thank you.

1055
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:09,680
D-Wave.

1056
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,680
A series of disappearance.

1057
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:12,640
N.

1058
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,220
Torch of salvation.

1059
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,120
I have to uncover the connection between these three.

1060
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,520
Confirm the identities of the missing, and if possible, rescue them.

1061
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:26,380
Yeah, I heard the...

1062
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,180
I heard this minigame is, like, super addicting.

1063
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:36,740
This is the mission that brought me here to this old mansion and the outer rim.

1064
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,240
Alright.

1065
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,940
I'm going in.

1066
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:43,380
Okay.

1067
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,140
Creak.

1068
01:21:50,480 --> 01:22:02,350
The front gates open to reveal The courtyard Thick fog Blankens the area Making it hard to see the surroundings

1069
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:44,960
Creepy Think so Not so good We are like in an abandoned mansion I don't know what scares you then We literally saw a dead body what was what screech did you hear that Dee not really aren't you being too jumpy is that so I'll keep moving

1070
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:57,020
maybe it's because I'm at the mansion that the torch of salvation uses as their base Keep King sounds like a rapture is nearby.

1071
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:00,930
Alright.

1072
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,940
Somewhere inside this thick fog.

1073
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,760
A rapture really is roaming around.

1074
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,980
One of the missing people.

1075
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,460
Maybe running from a rapture.

1076
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,740
Or even fighting one right now.

1077
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,680
I just hope that's not the case.

1078
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,460
I was like, did you not hear the screaming people?

1079
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:25,460
Oh!

1080
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,440
Okay.

1081
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,580
Let's look at the tutorial.

1082
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:34,190
Okay, let's not look at the tutorial.

1083
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:35,030
Let's just go in.

1084
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,250
Submachine gun.

1085
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:43,590
Continuous fire fires a large number of bullets dealing damage to enemies.

1086
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:49,290
Initiates continuous bombing dealing damage.

1087
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:49,910
Okay, okay.

1088
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:51,090
I can only be...

1089
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,650
Oh, I guess I have to unlock the others later.

1090
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,110
Oh, available after.

1091
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,930
Okay, it's later on.

1092
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:57,990
Alright.

1093
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,370
tutorial done.

1094
01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:02,110
I know what to do.

1095
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:08,730
It's a mini-game where you merge and upgrade weapons to stop incoming monsters.

1096
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:13,650
Efficiency, efficiently upgrade your characters in the shop.

1097
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:17,170
That appears after wave ends or through trait schedules.

1098
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:18,590
Wave and monsters.

1099
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,230
Monsters come in waves.

1100
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:22,830
And you must survive a total of 99 waves.

1101
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:24,110
99!

1102
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:25,350
Oh my.

1103
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:25,670
Okay.

1104
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,450
That's fine.

1105
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:27,190
We can do this.

1106
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:27,890
Oh!

1107
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:28,730
Tetris!

1108
01:24:30,930 --> 01:25:30,390
Bumparadom The shop opens after a wave Ends It consists of two sections Inventory weapons You can manage your inventory management Weapons can be freely moved Between the inventory and weapons selections As long as your size does not exceed the inventory Inventory capacity There are two types of weapons Weapons and sub-weapons Tap the weapon view icon to view the weapon info Alright Remove all weapons in section and replace them With fixed number of new it and their weapons and once all free profit are used um oh oh my god oh my oh my god you can scroll down oh okay all right okay now okay that makes a lot more sense i was like uh i didn't really scroll down i was like what the where does the sentence come from Drop weapons ship.

1109
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,090
I don't know.

1110
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:32,430
I thought it was just...

1111
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:33,850
This is the next phase.

1112
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,910
Weapons place will be used in battles.

1113
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:39,650
Inventory is in battle.

1114
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:42,530
And the weapon is where I refresh it.

1115
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:48,530
I can merge them.

1116
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:48,930
Okay.

1117
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:51,070
Stacking weapons of the same type.

1118
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:53,730
Can merge and become stronger weapons.

1119
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:54,230
Okay.

1120
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:58,650
I mean...

1121
01:25:58,650 --> 01:25:59,390
I might as well...

1122
01:25:59,410 --> 01:25:59,950
just

1123
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:20,670

1126
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,080
I got very scared.

1127
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,640
I was like, guys, you're getting closer.

1128
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,440
I don't think we need to use the special yet.

1129
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,740
Defeating monsters earn a certain amount.

1130
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,820
Oh, it's like a roguelike.

1131
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,580
Earn a certain amount of XP to conduct upgrades.

1132
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,860
When leveling up, you can select traits that provide different effects.

1133
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,080
Traits are divided in phase one and two.

1134
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:38,880
By default, three options are presented.

1135
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:47,320
a same type can be owned while unique traits can also be obtained once per game okay

1136
01:27:53,680 --> 01:28:11,600
okay oh yeah it's a roguelike oh my god that's i love roguelikes increase the ot duration decreases normal attack reload time by three percent okay i feel like xp is always important

1137
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,290
XP is always important in my early game.

1138
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,810
Early games should always, like, look into XP.

1139
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,170
Uh...

1140
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:28,770
I don't know.

1141
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:32,110
Let's see.

1142
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:32,790
210.

1143
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:35,170
55.

1144
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:36,150
Wait, what?

1145
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,830
Wait, this gun is better.

1146
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:40,470
55?

1147
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,120
Yeah, this attack is 210.

1148
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,580
That's so much.

1149
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:49,240
What?

1150
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,140
I merge this?

1151
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,520
Can I only merge that once?

1152
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:06,070
Oh, it only fires a single bullet?

1153
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:11,490
Oh, it increases the number of bullets fired per shot.

1154
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,390
Oh, I did have that same color merge.

1155
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:21,670
I see.

1156
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,370
I see.

1157
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,610
Oh, no.

1158
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:30,630
I feel like I'm going to try this for now.

1159
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:50,150
ditch the toolkit it's toolkit not that important i thought you'd be more important yeah but if i ditch the toolkit i can't even put this gun i'm gonna do two nades let's use two nades oh

1160
01:29:54,780 --> 01:30:02,940
not this early i see aoe attack first skill Am I using eye grenades?

1161
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,800
We'll do that.

1162
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,500
I feel like that's important right now.

1163
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:13,560
Oh.

1164
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,560
I'll expand here.

1165
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,520
Actually...

1166
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:21,560
What

1167
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,020
is that here?

1168
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,280
Oh!

1169
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,700
Let's see.

1170
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:47,740
Okay.

1171
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,120
Yeah, I'll do it here.

1172
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:01,640
There we go.

1173
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,420
Fire bullets in a fan shape dealing damage to enemies.

1174
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,060
Is this better?

1175
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,470
I'll do this.

1176
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,160
What does this do again?

1177
01:31:20,620 --> 01:31:21,900
Oh, increases XP.

1178
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:22,780
We need more XP.

1179
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:24,740
I can't fuse them.

1180
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,440
Yeah, it can't be merged.

1181
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,900
Alright, start battle.

1182
01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:36,750
It has to be...

1183
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:39,170
I don't mind.

1184
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:43,890
I'm going to do XP just because I feel like XP is always important in early game.

1185
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:48,410
Um, when I play Rogue Lights.

1186
01:31:58,570 --> 01:31:59,130
Uh.

1187
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:01,830
There you go.

1188
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:09,440
There's a level cap.

1189
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:14,780
Oh, nice.

1190
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:19,320
What's this?

1191
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,440
Oh my god.

1192
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:20,800
Alright.

1193
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,670
we'll grab knockback too

1194
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:35,160
all right uh

1195
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:52,720
nice I'm pretty good at this I say as I'm only on wave 6 I can tell why this can get dictating these are like my rabbit hole to addiction

1196
01:32:57,610 --> 01:33:05,310
I have shotgun so I feel like this would be good but this is okay I I would do 5% over regular reload.

1197
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:09,730
I love roguelikes.

1198
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:12,490
I like, it's actually like, for me it's a problem.

1199
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,450
I get so addicted to roguelikes in general.

1200
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,020
Oh, needle.

1201
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,380
With mild side effects, the greases the barricade HP by tube.

1202
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,760
That's fine.

1203
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:37,280
I'm not too worried about that.

1204
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,440
I think that's fine.

1205
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:44,780
That's nothing too scary.

1206
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,700
scary for me.

1207
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,100
Let's start it.

1208
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:00,000
I feel like I should use this when the boss shows up.

1209
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,100
I feel like, yeah, normal attack.

1210
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,920
This is not scary yet.

1211
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:10,800
I feel like I need cooldown, cooldown, or speed.

1212
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,220
What the heck?

1213
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,340
What is this?

1214
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:16,900
Assault rifle.

1215
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,260
Is assault rifle good?

1216
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:20,460
Compared to what?

1217
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,940
what I have right now.

1218
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:44,290
I'll have to get, I mean, I could get rid of this and put this in, but is it worth it?

1219
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:45,510
That's the thing.

1220
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,620
So I can figure this out.

1221
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:56,570
No, it's not.

1222
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:08,260
I'm like thinking if it's worth keeping this gun pistol, it's better to ditch the pistol.

1223
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,840
No, you can't rotate them.

1224
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,880
Which is better?

1225
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,860
This, uh...

1226
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,080
Put the rifle in the bottom spot.

1227
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,120
I don't think I can...

1228
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:26,540
No.

1229
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,440
I think it's better here.

1230
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:36,460
I think it's better here.

1231
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:42,630
Yeah.

1232
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:47,010
Is assault...

1233
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:48,410
AR is better than SMG?

1234
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:49,370
Okay.

1235
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:51,550
We'll try this then.

1236
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,390
I didn't even get another XP.

1237
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:56,810
I'll invest in XP.

1238
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:00,810
And then...

1239
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:03,090
Oh, range, actually.

1240
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:04,870
I'll do range because it's Urple.

1241
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,470
I invest on anything that's purple.

1242
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:13,310
Urple, good.

1243
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:15,530
Okay, XP.

1244
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,440
I wish I can stockpile this.

1245
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,800
Oh, wait, nice, I can.

1246
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:24,440
Hee-hee.

1247
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,900
What if double pistol?

1248
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:29,700
Alright, nice.

1249
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,260
I can merge the metals.

1250
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,090
Oh, no.

1251
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:40,150
Two urples!

1252
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:45,020
Oh, wait.

1253
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:45,940
I don't have anything for that.

1254
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:46,980
I have to do any of it.

1255
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,660
I was like, oh my god, two urples!

1256
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,860
But I was like, wait, I don't even have any of these guns.

1257
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:00,020
Nice.

1258
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,060
That's good.

1259
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:02,620
We haven't had to use.

1260
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:03,880
There hasn't been like...

1261
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:14,520
I feel like this It's not worth it

1262
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,860
I'm thinking if I should merge here

1263
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:33,430
Hmm I'm thinking about like

1264
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:43,660
I should do that Yeah I'm thinking about gun shapes right now too That's the thing

1265
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:57,140
I need this Yeah I think I should do that so then i can move that here and down here

1266
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:15,110
might be a little dumb what i did but it's okay it might be a little dumb what oh critical rate i was like what what does that do

1267
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:43,140
ah it is a little dumb it might have been a little dumb but

1268
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:58,340
I want The silencer is good But we're not with the metal then

1269
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:09,900
Move the grenade down

1270
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:17,390
Yeah, but then we lose this gun

1271
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:25,930
We do this Oops

1272
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:32,450
Oh, this sucks

1273
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:43,920
Oh, JK I'm so good at this JK Bump on bump

1274
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:52,160
I'm so good at this.

1275
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:53,760
Plan.

1276
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,000
Yeah, I don't even know what I put in.

1277
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:57,400
Increases.

1278
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:58,960
Okay, barricade HP.

1279
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,320
Big brain.

1280
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:03,660
Instead turn around.

1281
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,120
It fits.

1282
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:13,210
Okay, normal damage.

1283
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:17,370
I'll wait for this to get a bit closer.

1284
01:40:19,230 --> 01:40:20,790
or I use it.

1285
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:25,330
Actually, I don't even have to use it.

1286
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:26,330
We're just good.

1287
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:28,890
Grab that.

1288
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,250
That's purple.

1289
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:33,890
Damage by 15%.

1290
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:35,950
This is 5.

1291
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:37,090
So we'll get the purple.

1292
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:43,490
Oh, I would love to keep the grenade, but I have no slots.

1293
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:50,970
Should I refresh it?

1294
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:51,710
Is it worth?

1295
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:52,090
it?

1296
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,260
Yeah, it was.

1297
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:57,920
It was so worth it.

1298
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:02,560
There we go.

1299
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:09,070
Describe the barricade?

1300
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:13,930
There's no reason for me to discard it because I don't have a slot for anything anyway.

1301
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:19,450
Like, I can't fit anything in here if I discard it.

1302
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:22,130
Unless I like okay, if I move this down.

1303
01:41:22,590 --> 01:41:23,730
Yeah, there's no reason.

1304
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:26,330
I don't think I...

1305
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:27,150
Oh wait, I can.

1306
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:29,910
There you go.

1307
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:33,490
I have the weirdest suitcase.

1308
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,250
If there's another EXP, I'll go grab it.

1309
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:44,030
That's exactly what I wanted.

1310
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:46,790
Everything always goes according to plan.

1311
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:51,150
My brain is expanding.

1312
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:53,190
It's optimizing.

1313
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:54,990
Oh my god.

1314
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:56,290
What is this?

1315
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:58,590
Oh.

1316
01:41:58,610 --> 01:41:59,790
Oh, no, that's blue.

1317
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:05,390
Oh, my God.

1318
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:08,090
How do I fit this?

1319
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:14,290
Is this good?

1320
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,500
Is it worth it?

1321
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,560
Flamethrower good?

1322
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,500
I meant to get rid of the shotgun.

1323
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:51,250
But...

1324
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:06,170
It's fire!

1325
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:13,540
Yeah, but I'm losing these.

1326
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,720
I'm losing my other shotgun.

1327
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,620
So I'm like, fuck it.

1328
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:22,780
I'll remove all of this, but I'll do it.

1329
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:25,980
I think that's the...

1330
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,660
I think that's the only way.

1331
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,600
Oh my god.

1332
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,340
I don't even know if they can get there.

1333
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,380
Get close enough.

1334
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:35,200
I just realized I was like, And they even let...

1335
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:35,860
What's this?

1336
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:37,060
What's DOT?

1337
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:39,800
It's purple.

1338
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:45,380
I feel like...

1339
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:45,980
What's DOT?

1340
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,020
Damage over time?

1341
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:53,660
Do I have weapons that do damage over time?

1342
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,430
Do I even have weapons that do damage over time?

1343
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:05,070
Burning damage?

1344
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:07,710
Okay, we'll do that then.

1345
01:44:09,330 --> 01:44:11,290
I just don't know if I have weapons.

1346
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:12,090
that does it.

1347
01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:16,230
So I'm, like, worried if it's worth it or not.

1348
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:19,030
I can't believe it's, like, 99 rounds.

1349
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:19,790
Oh, my gosh.

1350
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:20,270
Okay.

1351
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,380
So I can move this up.

1352
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:35,860
Oh.

1353
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:08,800
I don't need the pistol, right?

1354
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,740
Is shotgun better than the pistol?

1355
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:12,760
Chat.

1356
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:16,840
Wait for a blue pistol?

1357
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:17,240
Okay.

1358
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:38,580

01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:26,760
Alright, I'm taking that risk.

1363
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:29,180
I'm taking that risk, guys.

1364
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:30,800
Oh my god, is that...

1365
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,900
That's not the enhanced, right?

1366
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,080
Surely it won't...

1367
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,480
Surely it won't fuck me over, right?

1368
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:38,520
Nah.

1369
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,000
Nah.

1370
01:46:42,220 --> 01:46:43,320
It'll be fine.

1371
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,100
It'll be fine.

1372
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:44,900
It'll be fine.

1373
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:46,360
It'll be fine.

1374
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,220
But it's gone!

1375
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:54,340
God!

1376
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:56,960
It'll be okay.

1377
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,240
Everything will be fine.

1378
01:46:58,600 --> 01:46:59,460
It'll be fine.

1379
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:02,920
I don't think I need to use it.

1380
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,220
I want to use it for emergencies.

1381
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,320
It hasn't been an emergency yet.

1382
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,800
I don't have any of these.

1383
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:25,930
Oh!

1384
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:27,870
Blast zone?

1385
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:30,450
Duration or AoE attack?

1386
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:34,280
Two?

1387
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,580
One or two.

1388
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:41,600
Oh yeah, I know.

1389
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:43,840
It's for a fire, a flamethrower.

1390
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:44,260
Two?

1391
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:44,640
Okay.

1392
01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:52,310
Oh my god.

1393
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:53,330
Okay, now I know how.

1394
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:55,070
Okay, they're getting too close to your right.

1395
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:55,630
Should I be smiling?

1396
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:04,280
I think I might need a repair kit.

1397
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,000
I think maybe.

1398
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:18,190
I don't know.

1399
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:24,820
Yeah, but I have no space.

1400
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:27,780
I don't know.

1401
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,180
where to fit it i

1402
01:48:34,270 --> 01:48:38,610
can't fit it anywhere there's

1403
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:48,410
nowhere for it to go but

1404
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,760
i i worked so hard

1405
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:08,630
i worked so hard for the shotgun oh

1406
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,980

1407
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:40,400
keep the shotgun drop the ar isn't that bad Is the AR worse than a shotgun?

1408
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:54,190
Okay.

1409
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,520
All right, we'll go with this.

1410
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,960
What if I just use it here?

1411
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:05,920
All right.

1412
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:13,390
Grab that.

1413
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:18,070
Oh my god, big boy is coming.

1414
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:20,290
Oh my god, oh my god, please.

1415
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:22,290
Oh my god, oh my god.

1416
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:24,030
Guys, why did we press gold?

1417
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:24,670
Why?

1418
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:29,410
Oh shit, why did guys, guys, why did we, why did we pick gold?

1419
01:50:30,010 --> 01:50:31,510
Why did we pick gold?

1420
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:36,160
He's so strong.

1421
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:41,020
Okay, we might have fucked up by picky gold.

1422
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,320
We might have messed up.

1423
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:50,830
Okay.

1424
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:55,930
Crisis up, brooded.

1425
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:06,050
I could grab another of this.

1426
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:20,690
Or do I grab the SMG?

1427
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:31,410
Keep shoddy for a gold chance?

1428
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:37,270
Keep shotgun?

1429
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:41,940
I can reroll.

1430
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:46,900
Oh, nice.

1431
01:51:47,980 --> 01:51:48,680
Oh, hey, sniper.

1432
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:16,710
Limbs are where we're snip- I mean, I can refresh again.

1433
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:23,490
We have a lot of gold, right?

1434
01:52:25,550 --> 01:52:27,150
We have so much gold.

1435
01:52:27,170 --> 01:52:29,470
I just realized What

1436
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:45,460
am I doing?

1437
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:51,020
I've just done this Grabbed their pistol

1438
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:08,420
Their pistol I don't think we need a shotgun So invest in the Pistol

1439
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:19,200
For upgrades later What kind of upgrades later Because

1440
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:31,310
I'm a little worried That I might have messed up Because Okay now Wait, all right, EXP?

1441
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:34,410
EXP or pierce damage?

1442
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:45,180
Or burst?

1443
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,420
One, two, or three?

1444
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:04,640
One?

1445
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,420
Okay, burst damage is nice.

1446
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,440
Okay, I'll go with burst.

1447
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,400
I'll give you stars!

1448
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:13,820
Oh my god.

1449
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:15,840
When is 30?

1450
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:16,540
Okay, thank god.

1451
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,900
Okay, I was gonna say when is it 30 seconds?

1452
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:21,480
Oh.

1453
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:23,600
Oh.

1454
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:27,320
None of these are good upgrades.

1455
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:44,500
Oh.

1456
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,140
I'm thinking.

1457
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:10,700
No.

1458
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,930
It moves the sniper up.

1459
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:21,070
Not really.

1460
01:55:21,690 --> 01:55:22,870
There's no reason to.

1461
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,000
So it doesn't really matter.

1462
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,680
It doesn't change anything.

1463
01:55:55,340 --> 01:56:13,020
I don't think it I think it was okay here wait where did I have it here here and then I think I'll keep I don't know I don't know if I want the pistol or the SMG I want pistol or SMG I can't tell

1464
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:22,700
you want ditch if we ditch the silencer I'll

1465
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:28,400
keep it like this

1466
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:37,880
I do not have a lot of HP I see it.

1467
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:44,040
Oh, it does what plus 1% It's my side did more

1468
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:53,920
I don't know BXB gain or

1469
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,160
Do I do one or two?

1470
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,380
Grenade stun.

1471
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,540
Oh, grenade stun, you're right.

1472
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:13,780
I forgot about that

1473
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:19,880
Okay Okay Okay, nice.

1474
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:21,400
Oh, nice.

1475
01:57:22,460 --> 01:57:23,560
That's actually so good.

1476
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,880
We got so many weapon upgrades from that.

1477
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:30,260
Yeah, a debuff was definitely better.

1478
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:32,720
Oh, my God.

1479
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,080
Why did I click the gold?

1480
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,280
Why did I...

1481
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,200
Oh, why did I click the gold?

1482
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:38,520
Oh, my God.

1483
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,140
They're getting so close.

1484
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:41,480
Oh, my God.

1485
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,340
They're getting closer.

1486
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,080
Oh, my poor.

1487
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:45,200
My poor wall.

1488
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:46,420
My poor wall.

1489
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,080
My wall is getting closer.

1490
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,540
So messed up.

1491
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:55,180
Two or three.

1492
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,760
This is my euphorus.

1493
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,520
Two or three.

1494
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,160
Numbers must go up no matter the cost.

1495
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:12,320
Greed is good.

1496
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:13,840
If it's...

1497
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,840
If Greed is good, why is it a deadly sin?

1498
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:18,600
Why?

1499
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,880
What do you mean?

1500
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:25,500
Oh, my poor wall.

1501
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,360
My poor wall.

1502
01:58:40,630 --> 01:58:42,690
I don't know where else to put this.

1503
01:58:58,250 --> 01:58:59,830
Okay, I sort of have an idea.

1504
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:05,210
Is that fine?

1505
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:05,530
Yeah.

1506
01:59:07,230 --> 01:59:09,010
What the heck is this?

1507
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:14,250
Oh, laser cannon.

1508
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:15,330
I was like, what?

1509
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:23,370
Is the laser cannon good?

1510
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:50,500
Oh my god, okay I need to figure this out

1511
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:12,510
Oh my god I

1512
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:25,610
Oh my, what did I do?

1513
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:27,790
What did I do?

1514
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:31,090
Okay

1515
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:41,600
Oh, what did I do?

1516
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:51,600
Okay, there you go I fixed it

1517
02:00:56,070 --> 02:00:58,590
Okay, there you go I think... I've...

1518
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:00,670
I've...

1519
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:02,670
Fixed it.

1520
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:07,540
I did it.

1521
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,300
I did it.

1522
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:11,760
That's fine.

1523
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:13,180
I think.

1524
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:16,600
There we go.

1525
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:17,500
We're fine.

1526
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:20,820
I fixed it.

1527
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,320
Everything looks okay.

1528
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:27,400
I'll give you stars!

1529
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:30,260
Oh my god, I'm a little stressed out.

1530
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:31,880
They're getting a lot closer.

1531
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:36,080
I'm getting stressed out.

1532
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:39,000
They're getting awfully close to me.

1533
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,280
Oh my god.

1534
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:40,920
Oh my god.

1535
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:41,500
Okay, we're good.

1536
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:41,900
We're good.

1537
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:42,200
We're good.

1538
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:42,640
We're good.

1539
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:46,900
AOE attack.

1540
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:47,680
Damage.

1541
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,020
We're okay.

1542
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:52,540
Okay, nice.

1543
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,480
Oh, we got a couple of upgrades.

1544
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:56,600
That's good.

1545
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,380

02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,140
It's okay.

1549
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,960
He's just slowly walking forward.

1550
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:33,100
It's okay.

1551
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:36,120
He might be slowly walking.

1552
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:36,760
We're okay.

1553
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:38,960
We're okay.

1554
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,560
We're okay.

1555
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,340
We're, we're, we're okay.

1556
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:50,960
And he's very menacingly walking.

1557
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:59,420
I feel like I'm going to refresh because I feel like this is the end of days right now.

1558
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:03,100
All right, that was useless.

1559
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:04,320
Okay, that's fine.

1560
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:09,160
That was...

1561
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:11,240
Oh, I wanted a barricade.

1562
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:14,320
Oh, why don't I have a barricade?

1563
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:23,420
All right.

1564
02:03:29,190 --> 02:03:29,790
Oh, my God.

1565
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:31,250
Why did I press gold?

1566
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:36,570
Why did I increase their damage?

1567
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:40,930
Oh my god, no!

1568
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:50,040
Oh no!

1569
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:50,980
Oh no!

1570
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:53,460
Everything's okay.

1571
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:14,360
I don't know.

1572
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:16,500
Yes, okay, like this.

1573
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:18,180
And then...

1574
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,260
Okay, here.

1575
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,860
Guys, green might not be good.

1576
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:36,600
Guys, I think...

1577
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:37,560
day I learned.

1578
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:39,440
Greed might not be good.

1579
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,000
It's crazy.

1580
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:41,660
I know.

1581
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:43,860
It's a crazy concept.

1582
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:49,140
But greed may be bad.

1583
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:50,560
Greed bad.

1584
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:05,200
That can't be, right?

1585
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:08,620
You sure.

1586
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:25,940
I don't know where to put the laser.

1587
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:32,540
Here and then

1588
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:56,890
laser top right like this

1589
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:08,980
that has to seem right

1590
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:40,400
hmm metal upper left here yeah but what do I do here then

1591
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:47,860
oh there you go yay!

1592
02:06:48,580 --> 02:07:00,380
Oh my god okay this works we did it this is the true this is the actual true puzzle I don't think we're living.

1593
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,640
I don't know.

1594
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:09,860
It's looking awfully rough for Jokey Bird right now.

1595
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:15,720
It's looking awfully bad right now for Jokey Bird.

1596
02:07:17,180 --> 02:07:18,640
Oh my god.

1597
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:22,500
Oh my very poor barricade.

1598
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:25,500
Um, oh my god.

1599
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:26,040
Okay.

1600
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:28,880
Let's do a normal attack.

1601
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:31,360
I have some machine gun shot.

1602
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:32,640
We don't need gold.

1603
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,580
We don't need gold Okay

1604
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:55,270
Oh, man Oh, man Oh, I'm refreshing.

1605
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:56,770
I have so much gold.

1606
02:07:57,490 --> 02:07:57,850
Oh, man.

1607
02:07:58,150 --> 02:07:59,230
Why did I refresh?

1608
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:05,530
Why did I refresh?

1609
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,860
Okay, but what if I refresh one more time?

1610
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:15,280
Oh my god, I need to stop.

1611
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,640
Why did I keep doing it?

1612
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:20,860
I thought it'd be different.

1613
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:25,480
I thought like something different will happen.

1614
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:29,520
Keep traveling.

1615
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,500
I don't know.

1616
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:35,180
I thought it'd be a different result for some reason.

1617
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:36,600
Clearly I was wrong.

1618
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:38,800
Oh, why?

1619
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,600
Why did I do that?

1620
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:57,540
that why did I make for it oh my god why did I have to make this harder for myself oh my god oh this

Oh, oh, oh, maybe I'll give you a barricade.

1624
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:25,500
Why?

1625
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:35,100
I keep thinking something different will happen, but it's still the same.

1626
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:46,740
I keep thinking something different will happen.

1627
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,260
Why do I still have one barricade?

1628
02:09:56,270 --> 02:09:59,450
Do not take that AR.

Wait, quick end.

How does it feel?

1640
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:38,240
A return.

1641
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,920
Oh, I didn't realize.

1642
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:41,720
I forgot yet.

1643
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:43,800
I forgot that this is the rogue.

1644
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:47,100
Like, oh my god, this is how people get to the end game.

1645
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:50,140
Grab this.

1646
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:51,600
What do we upgrade?

1647
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:53,960
Okay, high-grade weapons, most likely.

1648
02:12:56,920 --> 02:12:59,060
We're not getting enhanced monsters.

1649
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:00,480
Oh, great.

1650
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:01,480
XP.

1651
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:03,640
Attack.

1652
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:09,540
Yeah, I'll do damage XP and weapons.

1653
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:13,040
Oh my god, there was more.

1654
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:16,000
What do you mean?

1655
02:13:16,260 --> 02:13:18,260
There was barricade HP.

1656
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,220
Okay, wait.

1657
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:20,580
Let's get rid of.

1658
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:29,720

1663
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:27,230

But gold.

1666
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,120
Gold is good.

1667
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:59,360
Is that what you said?

1668
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:01,580
I don't know.

1669
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,800
Pistol is good, right?

1670
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:04,920
Pistol is better than shotgun and sniper, right?

1671
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:10,040
But what?

1672
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,120
Gold equals more gold.

1673
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:14,480
Don't keep but the points, though.

1674
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:18,220
Pistol, alright.

1675
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:18,880
We'll go with pistol.

1676
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:22,580
Sniper.

1677
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:27,000
is bis sniper for later it's fine oh gold

1678
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:37,360

1680
02:16:04,130 --> 02:16:06,490
Pew pew pew pew.

1681
02:16:07,850 --> 02:16:08,530
All right.

1682
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:09,950
I'll do the XP.

1683
02:16:12,270 --> 02:16:12,670
Chili.

1684
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:14,050
Two or three.

1685
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:15,590
I feel like X...

1686
02:16:18,510 --> 02:16:20,750
Always choose damage.

1687
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:21,490
Oh, okay.

1688
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:23,010
That'll do three.

1689
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:25,530
Make a square.

1690
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:33,220
I have two grenades now.

1691
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,240
Yeah, that's fine.

1692
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:43,540
Oh, EXP early is good?

1693
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,680
People are saying there's a level cap though.

1694
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:48,760
There's a level cap so there's no point.

1695
02:16:49,320 --> 02:16:50,340
Grab that, it's purple.

1696
02:16:54,910 --> 02:16:57,070
It's taking EXP do it very early.

1697
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:03,500
All right.

1698
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:07,320
So I feel like...

1699
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,380
Oh, EXP is harder to get later.

1700
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:11,300
Oh, okay.

1701
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:15,320
Why the fuck would I get the third one?

1702
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:22,220
Alright, if I get another XP thing, I'll take it.

1703
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:22,820
Knock back.

1704
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:26,560
If I see another XP one, I'll take it.

1705
02:17:35,490 --> 02:17:35,970
Uh...

1706
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:38,830
Hmm...

1707
02:17:42,420 --> 02:17:44,060
Oh, this is difficult.

1708
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:54,010
Oh...

1709
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:03,790
I don't know if they can fit anything in here.

1710
02:18:05,910 --> 02:18:06,270
Yeah.

1711
02:18:06,810 --> 02:18:07,890
I can't fit anything.

1712
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:13,560
I'll give you stars.

1713
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:14,680
I'll just use all of this now.

1714
02:18:18,550 --> 02:18:18,590
Alright.

1715
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:19,210
My record.

1716
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:20,230
What was my record?

1717
02:18:22,010 --> 02:18:22,330
Ooh.

1718
02:18:22,550 --> 02:18:23,070
Damage.

1719
02:18:37,230 --> 02:18:38,250
Go like that.

1720
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:40,150
Oh, nice.

1721
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:41,810
I created this just for that.

1722
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:44,310
Damage.

1723
02:18:44,770 --> 02:18:45,550
More grenades.

1724
02:18:46,650 --> 02:19:12,810
25 okay wait 25 was my record I'll give you stars a 9,000 points okay I gotta get I think I'm gonna look at waves not points I'll give you stars pierce attack damage I don't really ah I feel like I don't have a lot of night I don't have a sniper so I feel like I should just do normal attack damage

1725
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:39,720
just a warning though upgrading enemies while giving you more xp money and score would definitely yeah no i don't worry i i definitely experienced that i don't don't worry i know that all too well i i have plenty of experience with that unfortunately we figured that out

1726
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:51,760
We may or may not have figured it out the very, very hard way.

1727
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:52,820
No,

1728
02:19:59,780 --> 02:20:01,440
this is useful for me.

1729
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,600
I feel like I just don't have space.

1730
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:11,460
Yeah.

1731
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,120
I don't know if it's worth just...

1732
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:18,140
I'm just gonna wait until I have more space.

1733
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:21,940
I think it's worth keeping.

1734
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:23,140
All these guns are just...

1735
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:26,020
I'll grab the UXP.

1736
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:33,200
Greed is good in moderation.

1737
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:48,050
Think about what to do.

1738
02:20:55,050 --> 02:20:55,930
Wait, just do that.

1739
02:20:56,890 --> 02:20:57,690
But I don't know.

1740
02:20:58,650 --> 02:21:00,210
I don't know how to expand this.

1741
02:21:00,510 --> 02:21:01,870
I can push this here.

1742
02:21:07,440 --> 02:21:08,000
How many...

1743
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:08,580
Like this?

1744
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:10,020
This is a shotgun shape, right?

1745
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:12,940
Was it like this, chat?

1746
02:21:18,890 --> 02:21:20,110
was it like this

1747
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:27,930
and now I can move this here too and then push all this down

1748
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:39,740
oh hey nice this that's actually what we need it

1749
02:21:47,700 --> 02:22:03,500
very convenient I wonder if I could like push this here and then put it here or would that be like pointless alright that's good speak of the devil We got a shotgun.

1750
02:22:07,870 --> 02:22:09,430
Grab the second one.

1751
02:22:09,510 --> 02:22:11,270
And then I'll do, like, damage again.

1752
02:22:12,490 --> 02:22:13,770
I'll give you stars.

1753
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:15,390
I wanted to use it for this guy.

1754
02:22:15,470 --> 02:22:17,110
Because he's like, warning, warning.

1755
02:22:17,910 --> 02:22:19,050
I was like, warning, warning.

1756
02:22:21,850 --> 02:22:22,270
Okay.

1757
02:22:22,710 --> 02:22:24,270
Normal attack reload time.

1758
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:25,450
Alright, one, two, or three?

1759
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:34,740
Three?

1760
02:22:36,980 --> 02:22:38,400
See, ones and three.

1761
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:42,860
Uh, I see more one.

1762
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:44,340
Okay, I'll do one.

1763
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:46,400
Ah, fuck, okay.

1764
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:53,760
I know if laser is worth the investment.

1765
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:55,940
I'll refresh it.

1766
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,700
And nice, that's actually what we needed, too.

1767
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,940
Alright, nice.

1768
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:03,620
That's what we needed.

1769
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:09,680
That was a good risk.

1770
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:12,320
That was a good risk.

1771
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:13,440
Calculated.

1772
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,020
Yeah.

1773
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:18,260
That refresh actually was so helpful.

1774
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:23,540
Doesn't matter.

1775
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,320
I don't have space for this pistol.

1776
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:27,080
Doesn't matter!

1777
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:33,400
Do we want damage increase?

1778
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:35,760
Should we keep that for the damage increase or?

1779
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:43,260
I don't know we can move anything around to fit anything.

1780
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:46,060
Everything is so weirdly...

1781
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:07,770
3% isn't worth Alright, let's do that then If it's not worth it, I'll keep the pistol for the upgrade

1782
02:24:11,960 --> 02:24:15,580
Alright, 1, 2 We don't have a lot of snipers, so it's like 2 or 3

1783
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:32,780
3 2 or 3 I see more 3, so I'll go with 3 It's like cooldown reduction, right?

1784
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:35,120
3 is cooldown reduction, right?

1785
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:40,680
Assume that makes it better.

1786
02:24:43,140 --> 02:24:43,140
Okay.

1787
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,300
Let's make another gun.

1788
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:51,260
I just make two guns.

1789
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:53,020
My two small pistols.

1790
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,880
We'll do that.

1791
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:08,120
And then I do that.

1792
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:09,260
And then swap this here.

1793
02:25:09,340 --> 02:25:10,360
And then this over there.

1794
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:13,620
And then...

1795
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:17,260
I'll do that here in case I have a big gun.

1796
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:20,040
Actually...

1797
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:20,480
Hmm.

1798
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:39,550
that here lower that down too memorize it guys I can see the guns right here I don't need a memorized gun patterns I see it right here guys

1799
02:25:44,490 --> 02:25:59,990
get the right you're like wow I can't believe you guys no I can I have the guns on my screen chat i know what it looks like guys i'm not that i swear i'm not that stupid

1800
02:26:09,310 --> 02:26:31,410
uh i'll do it here so like if we get like a shotgun we put it here too oh see look at that it worked out it actually worked out nice okay my original plan was to move this here okay Okay, actually, we could just put this here.

1801
02:26:33,430 --> 02:26:34,150
I actually worked out.

1802
02:26:41,470 --> 02:26:43,050
I would like to put...

1803
02:26:43,050 --> 02:26:43,370
Hmm.

1804
02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:51,760
That's fine.

1805
02:26:56,930 --> 02:26:58,110
Refresh for pistol.

1806
02:27:00,070 --> 02:27:00,750
I can try.

1807
02:27:02,450 --> 02:27:03,210
It's fine.

1808
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:04,170
We got this, though.

1809
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:15,700
I can fit that in.

1810
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:16,160
How?

1811
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:22,700
No.

1812
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:23,540
No.

1813
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,360
I don't think so.

1814
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:31,820
It's pretty full.

1815
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:36,060
I bet this in.

1816
02:27:37,820 --> 02:27:38,920
Grenade bottom left.

1817
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:41,020
But where would we put the toolkit then?

1818
02:27:46,050 --> 02:27:47,930
We don't need critical rate, right?

1819
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:48,470
Yeah?

1820
02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:50,330
Like this?

1821
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:54,920
Alright.

1822
02:27:58,290 --> 02:28:00,210
Toolkit is my baby, guys.

1823
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:01,170
No, don't say that.

1824
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:01,390
Shh.

1825
02:28:01,770 --> 02:28:02,130
Toolkit.

1826
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:03,850
They don't mean that.

1827
02:28:04,170 --> 02:28:04,510
Shh.

1828
02:28:04,670 --> 02:28:05,770
The dragons don't.

1829
02:28:05,790 --> 02:28:11,890

1833
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:38,420
we just need one two more blues for this i don't even know if it's worth getting the adr i don't think it's worth it if i do a refresh i could get two shotguns

1834
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:48,620

1835

1836
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:26,860
I feel like knockback's always good.

1837
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,380
Oh my god, you're getting closer.

1838
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:31,160
He's getting closer.

1839
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:32,980
Oh my god, he's getting so close.

1840
02:30:33,220 --> 02:30:34,500
Oh my god, it's fine.

1841
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:43,020
Hmm.

1842
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:57,760
Yeah, see, the toolkit clutched it.

1843
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:59,860
At the bottom, I could.

1844
02:31:01,180 --> 02:31:01,640
Oh, nice.

1845
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:04,740
How was... Okay, I was gonna say

1846
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,860
Stop that.

1847
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:09,500
Fuck it.

1848
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:12,080
I just got a better grenade.

1849
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:16,650
Hmm.

1850
02:31:20,460 --> 02:31:21,120
That's fine.

1851
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,480
Yeah, it looks good.

1852
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:31,560
We're almost there.

1853
02:31:32,180 --> 02:31:32,880
See, look at that!

1854
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:33,780
We're back to 100!

1855
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:34,440
I told you.

1856
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:35,440
See, toolkit?

1857
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:37,100
They were wrong about you.

1858
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,000
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

1859
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:45,820
I knew you were going to be the clutch of the family.

1860
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:47,380
Oh my god, barricade.

1861
02:31:54,290 --> 02:31:54,710
There we go.

1862
02:31:54,870 --> 02:31:56,130
We just need...

1863
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:00,070
There we go.

1864
02:32:01,670 --> 02:32:03,750
That was a good decision for me.

1865
02:32:05,810 --> 02:32:07,750
Because I could get blue and then max it out.

1866
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:09,510
Nice.

1867
02:32:10,110 --> 02:32:10,530
See?

1868
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:15,310
I got good reroll

1869
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:36,050
I find it funny that yesterday I was playing a roguelike a roguelike survivor game and then we're back they knew they knew I have they knew my addiction

1870
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:47,550
last reroll that's worth it It was a very calculative risk.

1871
02:32:49,710 --> 02:32:51,570
There you go.

1872
02:32:56,150 --> 02:33:00,290
She's doing so good when she's not actively injuring herself.

1873
02:33:01,030 --> 02:33:02,270
You don't understand!

1874
02:33:02,910 --> 02:33:04,510
It was gold!

1875
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:06,330
You don't understand!

1876
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:11,130
It glowed yellow!

1877
02:33:11,890 --> 02:33:13,410
Yellow equals good!

1878
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:15,450
I'll give you stars

1879
02:33:22,050 --> 02:33:32,230
We'll do that here But You look good You look Not good

1880
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:58,270
Hmm We don't need that pistol We can try and aim for an AR upgrade Uh Okay guys Is Pistol or AR What is better?

1881
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:07,500
AR?

1882
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:10,620
Okay, well, we'll aim for AR upgrades then.

1883
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:15,440
I mean, they're both great, so it doesn't really matter to me.

1884
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,260
Ew!

1885
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:19,800
I'll give you stars!

1886
02:34:24,900 --> 02:34:27,180
Wait, does two pistols not...

1887
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:32,410
I'll do the OE.

1888
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:36,150
We have a lot of grenades and stuff anyway.

1889
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:42,130
Wait, that is like...

1890
02:34:44,410 --> 02:34:46,870
Can you not use more than one pistol?

1891
02:34:55,560 --> 02:34:57,580
If I have two pistols...

1892
02:35:02,900 --> 02:35:04,160
Oh, you can't stack.

1893
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:05,420
Okay, I was gonna say like, what?

1894
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:06,460
What's the point then?

1895
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:09,340
Like, I was like, excuse me, what do you mean I can't stack?

1896
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:10,740
Okay.

1897
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:15,000
I'm thinking right now.

1898
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:18,560
I just need another blue grenade.

1899
02:35:21,480 --> 02:35:22,180
It's fine.

1900
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:23,000
We'll start here.

1901
02:35:31,010 --> 02:35:31,350
Oh, no.

1902
02:35:31,610 --> 02:35:32,310
I didn't realize.

1903
02:35:32,490 --> 02:35:32,810
Oh, my God.

1904
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:33,330
You serious?

1905
02:35:34,310 --> 02:35:34,770
Oh, my God.

1906
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:37,510
I didn't realize they sent in the big boys.

1907
02:35:38,650 --> 02:35:40,350
Oh, okay.

1908
02:35:40,750 --> 02:35:41,250
It's okay.

1909
02:35:41,390 --> 02:35:41,590
It's okay.

1910
02:35:41,650 --> 02:35:43,110
My toolkit's gonna come in clutch.

1911
02:35:43,530 --> 02:35:45,390
My toolkit is coming in clutch.

1912
02:35:45,810 --> 02:35:46,290
Look at it.

1913
02:35:46,410 --> 02:35:46,990
Oh, okay.

1914
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:47,810
Don't worry.

1915
02:35:47,950 --> 02:35:48,650
It's gonna fix.

1916
02:35:48,730 --> 02:35:49,590
He's gonna fix him.

1917
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:50,990
He's gonna fix it.

1918
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:51,930
There we go.

1919
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:53,790
Aoe time.

1920
02:35:54,070 --> 02:35:54,390
Reload.

1921
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:55,530
I'll grab gold.

1922
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:57,090
See, I told you.

1923
02:35:57,270 --> 02:35:58,690
I told you it comes in.

1924
02:35:58,810 --> 02:35:59,910
Oh my god.

1925
02:36:00,650 --> 02:36:02,610
Okay, we can have blue at least for this.

1926
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:07,800
I'll just use once.

1927
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:11,800
I mean, I can get this at least.

1928
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:20,040
I really want to grab this, but it doesn't matter.

1929
02:36:20,700 --> 02:36:22,800
The little toolkit that could.

1930
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:29,060
Ah.

1931
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:44,550
Move the gold coin up and the laser over.

1932
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:48,790
What?

1933
02:36:56,830 --> 02:37:00,430
I want to grab this, but...

1934
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:02,210
I have no space.

1935
02:37:04,610 --> 02:37:06,210
Alright, I don't think I can keep it.

1936
02:37:06,930 --> 02:37:07,630
It's fine.

1937
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:10,530
I haven't found another coin yet.

1938
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:12,530
Oh no.

1939
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:13,130
Okay.

1940
02:37:23,610 --> 02:37:24,330
Alright.

1941
02:37:24,830 --> 02:37:25,830
This is fine.

1942
02:37:26,610 --> 02:37:27,310
This is fine.

1943
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:29,010
We're slowly healing it all.

1944
02:37:29,150 --> 02:37:30,830
We're slowly healing it all.

1945
02:37:31,010 --> 02:37:31,590
Don't worry.

1946
02:37:31,750 --> 02:37:33,970
The toolkit that could hit.

1947
02:37:34,430 --> 02:37:35,310
I'll grab the pierce.

1948
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:37,370
I think it's worth it now.

1949
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:44,580
Grab that here.

1950
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:46,300
So at least I can make this here.

1951
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:01,100
Trying to expand my brain.

1952
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:02,280
Okay, I put this here.

1953
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:04,280
Put this here.

1954
02:38:04,340 --> 02:38:05,260
And then I'll put this here.

1955
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:06,460
There you go.

1956
02:38:09,220 --> 02:38:09,840
Oh, wait.

1957
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,220
The moment I beat this wave, I beat my record.

1958
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:19,480
Okay, I'm still healing everything.

1959
02:38:26,780 --> 02:38:27,640
Okay, nice.

1960
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:31,440
I'm a lot healthier than before.

1961
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:37,020
Even though they're getting through, I'm still a lot healthier than before.

1962
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:42,020
Healthy is healthy, guys.

1963
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:43,400
Healthy is healthy.

1964
02:38:45,720 --> 02:39:00,720
I can't This is so bad Okay That was not The risk wasn't worth it Oh the upgrade isn't worth it I actually need more inventory space

1965
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:06,760
Yeah there's nothing worthwhile

1966
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:16,080
Come on keep giving stars Keep giving stars, Jill!

1967
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:17,940
I'll give you stars!

1968
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:19,480
Keep doing it!

1969
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,320
You got this!

1970
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:23,580
Okay, nice.

1971
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:25,420
She kept giving stars.

1972
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:29,940
There's nothing.

1973
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:31,280
I...

1974
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:32,080
One more refresh.

1975
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:32,660
Oh!

1976
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:36,040
Okay, goodbye, blue.

1977
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:37,260
Oh, I need to...

1978
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:38,680
I should keep that blue, though.

1979
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:42,760
I could make another gold.

1980
02:39:43,980 --> 02:39:44,800
Is it worth?

1981
02:39:44,820 --> 02:39:45,080
it?

1982
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:46,400
Making another gold?

1983
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:02,670
Ah.

1984
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:15,050
Alright.

1985
02:40:15,590 --> 02:40:16,490
This is hard.

1986
02:40:16,670 --> 02:40:19,470
This is like, I can make another gold gun.

1987
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,440
It's so rough decisions.

1988
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:33,560
AOE.

1989
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:34,320
That's purple.

1990
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:35,140
Purple good.

1991
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:37,300
Oh my god.

1992
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:37,700
Oh my god.

1993
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:38,020
Tock it.

1994
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:38,340
Please.

1995
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:38,720
Tock it.

1996
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:39,040
Please.

1997
02:40:39,360 --> 02:40:40,520
You got the 69.

1998
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:41,040
Nice.

1999
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:41,940
No!

2000
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:43,440
Heal!

2001
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:44,120
Heal!

2002
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:44,840
Tock it!

2003
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:46,600
Heal!

2004
02:40:52,870 --> 02:40:55,150
Alright, we can move these here.

2005
02:40:56,890 --> 02:40:57,750
This up.

2006
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:00,370
This here.

2007
02:41:00,570 --> 02:41:01,150
No, actually...

2008
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:06,190
God, all these suck.

2009
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:08,070
They all suck!

2010
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:17,290
There's nothing to do.

2011
02:41:19,190 --> 02:41:19,710
That's okay.

2012
02:41:20,770 --> 02:41:23,390
The toolkit can heal.

2013
02:41:26,390 --> 02:41:27,570
Look at that.

2014
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:30,110
One at a time.

2015
02:41:31,790 --> 02:41:32,890
Oh, come on.

2016
02:41:34,010 --> 02:41:36,010
Just don't let them get any closer.

2017
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:40,230
Oh.

2018
02:41:40,810 --> 02:41:41,410
Purple.

2019
02:41:42,890 --> 02:41:43,310
Oh, my God.

2020
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:43,770
I'm halfway.

2021
02:41:44,110 --> 02:41:44,950
I'm half HP.

2022
02:41:45,890 --> 02:41:46,590
Oh, my God.

2023
02:41:46,710 --> 02:41:47,810
They're getting closer.

2024
02:41:48,430 --> 02:41:48,770
Token.

2025
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:49,790
The token.

2026
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:50,690
That good.

2027
02:41:51,350 --> 02:41:51,590
Oh.

2028
02:41:57,470 --> 02:41:58,950
Okay, we have more nades.

2029
02:42:00,750 --> 02:42:01,130
More nades.

2030
02:42:01,550 --> 02:42:02,850
Oh, this might be the last.

2031
02:42:03,450 --> 02:42:04,970
Guys, this might be it.

2032
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:07,510
This might be it.

2033
02:42:08,110 --> 02:42:10,290
This is where we might have to oh, seven.

2034
02:42:11,690 --> 02:42:14,730
I don't think the toolkit can out heal anymore.

2035
02:42:15,310 --> 02:42:15,850
I...

2036
02:42:19,910 --> 02:42:21,470
Oh, wait, gold.

2037
02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:24,050
Oh, my God.

2038
02:42:24,270 --> 02:42:25,750
They're still coming.

2039
02:42:26,350 --> 02:42:26,810
Oh, my God.

2040
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,370
Oh, my God.

2041
02:42:27,390 --> 02:42:29,130
Maybe I can survive one more round.

2042
02:42:29,530 --> 02:42:31,350
I can survive one more round.

2043
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:34,310
We survived one more round.

2044
02:42:35,490 --> 02:42:36,610
We have gold pistol.

2045
02:42:37,050 --> 02:42:38,110
It's doable.

2046
02:42:39,330 --> 02:42:39,830
It is.

2047
02:42:40,250 --> 02:42:43,210
It is absolutely doable.

2048
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:49,810
Spend it on now.

2049
02:42:53,170 --> 02:42:54,110
I believe.

2050
02:42:54,750 --> 02:42:57,670
Why did I not get another toolkit?

2051
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:27,780
okay okay i don't know yes it's looking a little rough just a little bit okay plus we're 12 hp we're we're living oh my god they're getting very close

2052
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:32,940
holy shit okay

2053
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:37,260
I'll grab this.

2054
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:40,260
I don't think that Pierce is gonna do anything for us.

2055
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:44,020
Oh, one, two, one, two, oh!

2056
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:54,060
Um, I realized I never got the XP thing.

2057
02:43:55,740 --> 02:43:58,340
I don't think it's gonna help us.

2058
02:43:58,900 --> 02:44:02,340
I don't think it's gonna do anything.

2059
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:06,520
Alright, zero HP and a dream.

2060
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:07,320
Let's go.

2061
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:13,310
They just gotta poke me one time.

2062
02:44:13,330 --> 02:44:14,410
And it's over

2063
02:44:21,310 --> 02:44:23,290
It's okay Oh

It's very dangerous.

2068
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:53,620
