1
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,660
Oh, shit.

2
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,460
Sorry, I forgot.

3
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,720
Sorry, my thing is still on my Uber Eats app.

4
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,220
Oh.

5
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,680
All right.

6
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,560
Bad news.

7
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,360
I'm sick.

8
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,240
I know.

9
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:52,960
Yet again.

10
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,420
It's so hard being the perfect human being.

11
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,760
No way.

12
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,740
I don't know how... I don't know how I went outside, you know, for my dog.

13
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,520
And then I got sick coming back.

14
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,640
I don't know how that happened.

15
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,580
I literally was outside.

16
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,200
Well, I was outside for a while.

17
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,980
But I touched grass.

18
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,700
And then, poof, I'm sick now.

19
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,840
I have...

20
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,520
So, I don't know how I'm going to be streaming today.

21
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,140
Because I do have my sponsor stream later today.

22
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,800
Yeah.

23
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,560
Will you stop drinking dad's vital fluids?

24
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,320
No!

25
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,800
I don't have easy access to the cure anymore.

26
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,200
Like they say, the owner reflects their pet.

27
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,380
But yes.

28
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:55,760
Yes.

29
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,480
Last night, I felt like...

30
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,020
The sore throat thing.

31
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,920
I felt it.

32
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,590
And then...

33
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,780
I'm sick to...

34
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,400
Twinsies!

35
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh, my God!

36
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,940
It's so good to be sick together.

37
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,200
Dark, thank you for the super chat.

38
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,120
Thank you, thank you.

39
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,040
Last night, I felt...

40
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,580
You know, like when you feel a tingling on your sore throat.

41
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,560
You feel that tingle.

42
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,980
And you know that like...

43
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,980
The moment your sore throat tingles...

44
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
You know that you're about to get sick.

45
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,400
And then, so like...

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,680
I prepped everything.

47
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,140
Like I prepped my humidifier.

48
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,920
I prepped...

49
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,600
Like I wet a towel.

50
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,460
And then put it on the side of my bed.

51
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,400
And then I woke up.

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,920
And my nose is so stuffy.

53
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,160
And...

54
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,460
You know, my throat...

55
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,700
Feels a lot better.

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,980
It doesn't hurt as much anymore.

57
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
It doesn't hurt anymore.

58
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,680
So like...

59
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,940
I hope that continues.

60
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,400
I hope my throat continues to be...

61
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,200
Okay.

62
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,480
And...

63
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,120
Uh...

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,340
Yeah.

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,840
So I just have my stuffy nose.

66
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,740
I'm gonna be blowing my nose a lot.

67
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,320
But that means I'm gonna be muting myself.

68
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,380
Blowing my nose a lot.

69
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,840
Because you guys don't get access to that.

70
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,320
No, no, no.

71
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Um, Nettie.

72
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,220
Thank you for the super chat.

73
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,520
Thank you.

74
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,080
Thank you.

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,880
Rate the soup.

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,240
I was thinking whether or not to...

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Reschedule today's stream.

78
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,680
But then I was like...

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,000
You know what?

80
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,800
Let's see how I go.

81
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,220
If I...

82
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,900
If I die, die.

83
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,060
If I...

84
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,800
If I get more sick...

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,660
It's on me.

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,460
I took the risk.

87
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
I took the 50-50.

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,940
I was like...

89
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,300
It won't be that bad.

90
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,100
Like...

91
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,700
Get the...

92
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,180
Like...

93
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,560
You know...

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,080
It's all...

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,140
It's all about gambling.

96
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,400
Let's go gambling with my health.

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,980
Kanye East.

98
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Thank you for this Magenta Soup.

99
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you.

100
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,820
Thank you.

101
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,220
For the soup funds.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,680
And Doki Healthcare funds.

103
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,860
Thank you for Magenta Soup.

104
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,600
Thank you.

105
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,360
Thank you.

106
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Okay.

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,980
My gacha luck in gacha is not great.

108
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,700
But like...

109
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,580
In real life...

110
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,340
It's...

111
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,440
Also not that great.

112
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,020
But...

113
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,160
But it's gonna turn around right now.

114
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,980
Today's the day where it turns around.

115
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,580
Robbins.

116
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,480
Thank you for the super chat.

117
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:08,780
Thank you.

118
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,060
Thank you.

119
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
Are you still putting minerals in the humidifier?

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,800
No.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,040
I boiled...

122
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,600
Oh.

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,120
Fuck.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,540
I forgot.

125
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
My humidifier might have been just boiled water.

126
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,580
I forgot about that.

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,800
Fuck.

128
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,180
Okay.

129
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,460
Okay.

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,060
That's fine.

131
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,140
It might have been boiled water.

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,420
Boiled tap water.

133
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,480
It's been a while.

134
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,380
All right.

135
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:37,820
Okay.

136
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,440
It'll only go up from here.

137
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,420
Starting now.

138
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,000
Aphelion.

139
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you for the five gifted chips.

140
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,820
Thank you.

141
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,640
Thank you.

142
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,760
The gacha gods are in your favor.

143
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,380
Thank you for the super chat, Joel.

144
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:51,840
Thank you.

145
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,560
Thank you.

146
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,940
Oh, yeah.

147
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,120
Life update.

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,160
Also, not so Deadpool.

149
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
Thank you for the gifted chips.

150
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,240
Thank you.

151
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,900
Thank you.

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,360
Life update.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,380
Oh, fuck.

154
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,360
What was the life update?

155
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,100
Give me a sec.

156
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,580
I'm...

157
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,320
It was in my head.

158
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,260
And then it disappeared.

159
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Yags, welcome to the tomato farm.

160
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Welcome.

161
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,340
Welcome.

162
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,240
Oh, my God.

163
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,420
What was this life update that I had to give you guys?

164
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,740
Was it important?

165
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,760
It could have been important.

166
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,640
Oh, fuck.

167
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:18,940
Okay.

168
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:20,660
Um...

169
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,140
Oh, my God.

170
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,780
It was, like, something related to, like, something I have to be...

171
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,080
I'll be doing later.

172
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,260
But, like, I don't remember right now.

173
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,940
Oh, no.

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,760
This is bad.

175
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,080
Okay.

176
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,100
I told myself...

177
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,480
All right, Doki.

178
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,180
Remember to talk about this on stream.

179
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,320
Um...

180
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,620
You don't need to write this down.

181
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,360
I...

182
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,160
It'll be fine.

183
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,020
You don't need to write this down.

184
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm like, you're right, brain.

185
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,200
I don't need to write this down.

186
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,460
Um...

187
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,860
Yags, welcome to the tomato farm.

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,200
Welcome.

189
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,520
Welcome.

190
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,100
Music.

191
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,380
Thank you for the super chat.

192
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:52,780
Thank you.

193
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,500
Thank you.

194
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,980
Happy to be watching on my birthday today.

195
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,340
Thank you for the super chat.

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,680
Thank you.

197
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,260
Thank you.

198
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,100
Happy birthday to you, too.

199
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,000
Happy birthday to you.

200
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,880
Happy birthday to you.

201
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,820
Happy birthday, dear music.

202
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,720
Happy birthday to you.

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,180
Yeah!

204
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,900
I just remembered it.

205
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,680
Because I just saw the $3 million prize pool from Marvel Rivals for, like, pro players.

206
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,420
Um...

207
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,640
Anyway.

208
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,340
To segue from that.

209
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,280
It's actually crazy that they're putting in $3 million right away for Marvel Rivals.

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,100
Like, competitive e-sports team.

211
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,140
Um...

212
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,380
Just because, like...

213
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,880
The amount of money they made just from cosmetics alone.

214
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,760
Like, it...

215
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,400
It shows you how much money they made from farming people off of cosmetics.

216
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,600
Off of cosmetics.

217
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,920
If they are just able to drop $3 million just right off the bat for their first LAN.

218
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,540
Because you guys don't know.

219
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,360
That's the LAN.

220
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,900
Because it's a world...

221
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,520
Um...

222
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,320
It's a world tournament.

223
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
So, like...

224
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,600
That's gonna be a LAN thing later on.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,480
Uh...

226
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,160
So, yeah.

227
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,880
Like, hey.

228
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,160
$3 million off the bat for LAN.

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
For their very first LAN.

230
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,200
Is absolutely insane.

231
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,660
But that's, like...

232
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,320
I guess that's NetEase being like...

233
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,060
Yeah, we made that much money off of you guys!

234
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,440
We made so much money off of you guys!

235
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,140
That $3 million is nothing!

236
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,280
Anyway.

237
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,500
The segue...

238
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,840
Off of that...

239
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,540
Um...

240
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,940
I got invited to the XQC Marvel Rivals tournament.

241
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,120
That's, like, the $250k...

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,280
Um...

243
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,300
The $250k dollars one.

244
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,900
That's gonna be somewhere in May.

245
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,620
I don't remember.

246
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,700
Um...

247
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,160
But, like, a huge shout-out to...

248
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,180
Um...

249
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,320
Um...

250
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,600
A huge shout-out to...

251
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,660
The Marvel Rivals does.

252
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,200
For, like, actually getting me in.

253
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,180
I asked about it.

254
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,040
Because I saw the...

255
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
Article about it.

256
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,140
I saw the...

257
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,660
Um...

258
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,440
Article...

259
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,500
About the tournament.

260
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,820
Because I saw XQC talking about it.

261
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,920
And then, like, people made articles.

262
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,680
Being like, oh, yeah.

263
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,220
XQC...

264
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,780
Um...

265
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,780
Is gonna be hosting this.

266
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,920
And I was like, oh, that's cool.

267
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,060
I want me in it.

268
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,120
And then I...

269
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,340
DM'd my...

270
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,520
Marvel Rivals staff person.

271
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,860
That I'm connected with.

272
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,240
Um...

273
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,900
And I asked, like...

274
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Oh, yeah.

275
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,900
Can I be...

276
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,020
Can I be, like...

277
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,680
Uh...

278
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,040
On...

279
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,840
Can I, like, join the tournament?

280
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,960
And then they were like...

281
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,200
Yeah.

282
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,160
We're gonna put...

283
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,880
And then they were like...

284
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,020
Yeah.

285
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,000
We're gonna ask...

286
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Um...

287
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,180
The XQC tournament, uh...

288
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,880
Team...

289
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,800
If we could get you in.

290
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,420
And, um...

291
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,180
They messaged me back.

292
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,980
And they were telling me, like...

293
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,060
Yeah.

294
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,580
You're on, like...

295
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,840
On top of our priority list.

296
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,460
Um...

297
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,220
And, like...

298
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,420
Uh...

299
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,160
They're gonna...

300
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,800
Uh...

301
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,900
They're gonna, like...

302
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,540
Contact you.

303
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,880
And then you'll be in the tournament.

304
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,400
And I was like...

305
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,840
Yippee!

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,260
And then yesterday...

307
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
Like, the...

308
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,940
One of the...

309
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,400
Um...

310
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,580
One of the people organizing the tournament...

311
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,260
Messaged me yesterday.

312
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:45,840
Um...

313
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,260
Being like...

314
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,440
Yeah.

315
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:46,860
Uh...

316
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,320
We're looking forward to seeing you in the tournament.

317
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:48,940
Uh...

318
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,120
We're gonna provide you with more info later on...

319
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,440
Um...

320
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,620
The next couple of the days.

321
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,960
So I think I'm confirmed to be in it.

322
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,320
Like...

323
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm gonna take that as the confirmation.

324
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,140
If, like...

325
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,080
The head guy that's organizing the tournament...

326
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,300
Like, literally messaged...

327
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,220
Added me on Discord.

328
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,820
And messaged me.

329
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
And told me that they're gonna give me more info later.

330
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,880
So, I hope so.

331
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,060
Oh, you know what's funny?

332
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay, what's funny is that... Apparently, there's some pro players that really wanted to be involved in XTC's tournament because it's $250,000.

333
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,440
Yeah, that's a lot of money.

334
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,200
But they've, like, barred any pro players from joining the tournament.

335
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,500
Like, any active Marvel Rivals pros joining it.

336
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,540
And then, it's funny because, like, one of my friends was saying how there were some teams that were, like, crashing out about it.

337
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,900
And they were like, it's $250,000!

338
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,280
This was before the $3 million... This was before the $3 million thing was announced.

339
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,760
And they were like, they're like, what are these streamers gonna do with $200,000?

340
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,820
They were like... My friend was like, the rich gets richer.

341
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,470
I thought... I thought that was a bit funny.

342
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:24,270
Because they're... It's like... Apparently, some teams were, like, crashing out about it because they were like, let me in!

343
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,990
Let me in!

344
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,590
No, no, this is a different... XQC's tournament is $250,000.

345
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,730
The Marvel Rivals eSport LAN, the first LAN, is $3 million.

346
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,710
So, it's different.

347
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,990
I thought that was, like... I thought that was funny.

348
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,390
Because, like, they're like, let me in!

349
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,410
We want to be in it, too!

350
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:05,430
But, apparently, from what I was told, and what other people told me, is that the tournament is gonna be, like, streamer only.

351
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,070
Streamer only.

352
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,010
So, like, no active pros in the Rivals scene will be part of the...

353
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,830
part of the XQC tournament.

354
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,010
So, I don't know who else is gonna be in it.

355
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,090
I just know I'm in it.

356
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,570
Like, I...

357
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,150
Well, obviously, XQC is also gonna be in it, too.

358
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,330
Because it's his tournament.

359
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,850
But, other than that, I just know I'm in it.

360
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,230
Like, I don't know who else.

361
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,570
I don't know the format yet.

362
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,770
I'll probably find out about it, like, later in a couple of days.

363
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,810
I don't even remember what day it's supposed to be.

364
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,970
Let me look that up.

365
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,670
Literally, the only thing I know about it is from, like, random...

366
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,450
like, Dexter or some shit.

367
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,070
XQC, Marvel, Rivals...

368
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,350
I need to, like, mark that off.

369
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,830
Okay, it's on May 9th, technically.

370
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,490
Okay, it's next week.

371
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,170
Oh, my God.

372
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,030
I didn't even realize it was gonna be next week.

373
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,850
Okay, let me mark this off for myself.

374
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,850
I don't know what time it's gonna be.

375
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,110
I just know it's somewhere on the 9th.

376
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,890
XQC, Marvel, Rivals, Tournament.

377
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,470
Let me mark that off real fast for myself so I don't forget.

378
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,010
XQC... I need to write this again.

379
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,570
Marvel, Rivals, Tournament.

380
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,170
So I have to start playing Rivals again in a couple of...

381
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,450
I guess, like, now.

382
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,310
XQC, thank you for the super chat.

383
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,070
Thank you, thank you.

384
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,510
Remember, Master Ui's wise words.

385
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,890
Monkey, thank you for the super chat.

386
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,710
Thank you, thank you.

387
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,270
No name.

388
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,250
Thank you for the super chat.

389
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:36,810
Thank you, thank you.

390
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,510
I know you hate Rocket, but $3 billion.

391
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,070
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

392
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,530
I think I'm like randomly placed in a team, I'm pretty sure.

393
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:53,030
Because like, I mean, it's next week, so like, we'll see how this is going to be like by then.

394
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,610
Daddy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

395
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,510
Ah, yes, Bloons, where I belong.

396
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,610
Hello, Doki Bird, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

397
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,850
I've actually never played Bloons before.

398
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,630
Is that crazy?

399
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,290
I've never, okay, today, I was deciding between Plants vs.

400
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,650
Zombies or Bloons, because I've never played either of those games before, so I don't know what it's gonna be like going in.

401
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,740
I just never played the game.

402
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:30,120
I know like, people in Overwatch used to play Bloons to, to like, wait out the queue and stuff, and the queues are too long.

403
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:37,100
But like, other than that, I've never actually, um, played this game before, so I'm, I have no idea going in.

404
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,580
I know like, you're like a monk, you put monkeys in, and you shoot like air, like, what is it?

405
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,360
Balloons?

406
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,640
It's like tower defense, right?

407
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,160
Uh, basically, right guys?

408
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,540
Uh, Alan, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,300
But Doki, what are you going to eat for?

410
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,680
They have their $3 million, and there we just got announced today.

411
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,660
They have their $3 million tournament, they don't need this $250k.

412
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,120
Thank you for the super chat, thank you.

413
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,860
Thank you.

414
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,320
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, thank you.

415
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,000
All right.

416
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,140
All right, let's see.

417
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,140
I need that $250k prize pool for, for that, that surgery.

418
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,220
For the fucking dog surgery I had.

419
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,980
Like, like, I take what I can get now.

420
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,640
All right, let me, uh, get the audio in.

421
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,160
Uh, bloons.

422
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,820
All right.

423
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,620
Pop, pop, pop.

424
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,720
All right, sound guy, let me know if it's okay.

425
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,420
Um, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

426
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,320
I still remember that one clip of you smoking him.

427
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,300
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

428
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,240
Pop, pop, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

429
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,900
The bloons have taken over the town.

430
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:05,700
Okay.

431
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,860
Stop the bloons from getting through.

432
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,680
Oh, is this a tutorial?

433
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,120
All right.

434
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,340
And then place another dart monkey.

435
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
Where do I place him?

436
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,600
I guess I'll place him here.

437
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,060
I'll place him in the front.

438
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,220
Wait, is that smart?

439
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,620
Well, time to find out.

440
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,900
Right in the day.

441
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,020
Doki, you're not supposed to place that monkey there.

442
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,480
One hundred bloons versus one monkey.

443
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,380
Uh, Black, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

444
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,240
It's not 250k, but I hope this helps with the vent bells and hope Dad recovers well.

445
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,440
Thank you, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

446
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,840
I really appreciate it.

447
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
Thank you so much.

448
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,000
All right.

449
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,440
I mean, that seems pretty easy.

450
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,540
When does this get hard?

451
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,560
Famous last words.

452
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,020
Earns you a monkey experience.

453
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,540
All right.

454
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,560
Your dart monkeys have enough to unlock an upgrade.

455
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,680
All right.

456
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Let's see.

457
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,900
First stream ever and it be on my birthday?

458
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,780
Thank you for the super chat, Yags.

459
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,880
Thank you, thank you.

460
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,440
Happy birthday.

461
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,560
Happy birthday to you.

462
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,440
Happy birthday to you.

463
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,620
Happy birthday, dear Yags.

464
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,500
Happy birthday to you.

465
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah.

466
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,020
All right.

467
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:34,720
All right.

468
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,780
Can pop shoot...

469
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,460
Can pop one extra balloon?

470
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,420
Makes the dart monkeys shoot further than normal?

471
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,460
Maybe like...

472
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,260
Extra balloon?

473
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,720
I feel like...

474
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,400
Oh, but then the 15% means I can do like four.

475
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,820
All right.

476
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,900
I'll need an extra one.

477
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,820
Wait, I'll do it.

478
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,920
And then I'll do 15% later.

479
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,920
Oh, I have to upgrade this myself as well?

480
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Oh.

481
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,060
All right.

482
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:04,840
There you go.

483
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,180
It's fine.

484
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,420
My monkeys can do it.

485
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,460
Go monkeys, go.

486
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,020
Need some help?

487
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,620
Quincy is a monkey hero that upgrades himself during that game.

488
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,640
He can pop several balloons per shot.

489
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,680
Oh wait.

490
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,800
Get in here, Quincy.

491
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,400
There you go.

492
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,300
Oh my god.

493
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,060
You sound like an adult.

494
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Candy, thank you for the super chat.

495
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,880
Thank you, thank you.

496
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,540
Dark Blade, thank you for the super chat.

497
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,500
Thank you, thank you.

498
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,080
Doki's sick again because she went outside again.

499
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,060
Doki never learns.

500
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
Stop going outside.

501
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,220
You know outside, bad.

502
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,040
Outside, evil.

503
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,980
Thank you for the super chat.

504
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,980
Thank you, thank you.

505
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,720
I'll never learn.

506
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,140
Why don't I learn that outside is bad?

507
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,980
All right.

508
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,560
Upgrade more?

509
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,000
All right, let's... I get that, actually.

510
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,320
The quickshot?

511
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,480
Does it travel over?

512
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,780
Do my upgrades travel over?

513
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,220
Oh my god, you know he's good when he has a bandana on his head.

514
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,720
All right.

515
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,860
There's no... You're right, there's no bloons outside.

516
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,060
What's the point?

517
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,600
Does it carry over?

518
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh.

519
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,980
Choose a monkey to unlock?

520
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,060
With my ice monkey?

521
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,020
I hear ice monkey is pretty good.

522
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,700
I see a lot of art about ice monkey.

523
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,020
All right, ice monkey.

524
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,400
You go here.

525
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,820
All right, do your thing, ice monkey.

526
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,940
Should I put it here?

527
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,420
Oh, maybe I should put it down here.

528
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm learning.

529
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
Anyone is a good choice.

530
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,680
I always see so much about ice monkey.

531
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,780
I'll put him here, too.

532
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,560
All right, there we go.

533
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,260
What is he doing?

534
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,340
Ice monkey, do something!

535
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm just too good.

536
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,840
I'm too good that ice monkey can't even do anything.

537
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,520
You have activated ability.

538
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,100
They create powerful temporary effects to help you win.

539
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,600
Choose carefully when you use them.

540
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,960
However, as each one has a cooldown...

541
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,500
Where's my ability?

542
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,860
Where is it?

543
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,960
How do I use it?

544
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,380
Where ability at?

545
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,360
Where is it?

546
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,340
What?

547
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,480
Lego.

548
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Lord.

549
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,800
I'm sorry, not Lego.

550
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,840
Lord, thank you for the super chat.

551
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,240
Thank you.

552
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,120
Oh, it's on... Oh, is it this?

553
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,800
Oh, that's... That's what it is.

554
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,120
Okay.

555
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,460
I don't think I need to do any... Oh, okay.

556
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,620
All right, use your ability.

557
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,380
I want to see.

558
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,540
Okay, we did it.

559
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
One round ago.

560
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,540
I don't think I need to do anything.

561
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,300
Oh, wait.

562
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,760
Did he use it?

563
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh, that was a waste.

564
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,040
I didn't know it was over!

565
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,100
I was just... I was just...

566
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,720
Blooning!

567
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,800
Also, how's the sound, guys?

568
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,780
Ice Monkey is so cool.

569
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,400
What's... He's just bluer!

570
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,920
What makes him cooler than the other monkeys?

571
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,220
He's just more blue.

572
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,340
All right.

573
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,640
Oh.

574
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,500
Oh, nice.

575
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
I got monkey money.

576
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,860
Oh, my God.

577
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,740
Wait, is this gacha?

578
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,080
Wait.

579
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Is this...

580
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Is this pay to win?

581
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,840
Did I accidentally play a game where I have to pay to win?

582
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,100
No?

583
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,140
Oh, that's good.

584
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,260
I was like, wait.

585
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,420
This has, like...

586
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,460
This is so, like, gacha-pilled.

587
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,900
Like, the...

588
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,660
The...

589
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,260
You know, like, when you know a microtransaction?

590
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,520
Yeah, like...

591
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
This menu is so...

592
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,980
Like, you can tell this was a microtransaction game.

593
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,780
Like...

594
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,880
You can...

595
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,840
You can just tell.

596
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,960
Yeah, the UI.

597
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
Um, interesting.

598
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,640
Thank you for the super chat.

599
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:55,960
Thank you.

600
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,600
Thank you.

601
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,540
I just got over my fear of monkeys after my cat.

602
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,040
What?

603
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
Anyway, what are you...

604
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,320
Just turned into the stream to the line.

605
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,700
What are you playing?

606
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm playing balloons.

607
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:09,800
All right.

608
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,560
I don't remember if anyone said anything about the sound, but...

609
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,840
I don't see anyone talking about the sound anymore.

610
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,040
So, I think it's okay.

611
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
We mouse-holded by the power of Battle Cat.

612
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,960
I can take him on.

613
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,700
You see, many portals appear in our world.

614
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,460
So, after the appear...

615
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:28,600
I...

616
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,160
You know what?

617
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,860
I went to the unusual readings were detected near Adora's temple.

618
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,820
So, I rushed over to set up more.

619
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,600
Um, I've done the calculations.

620
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,540
Uh, and the riff will appear very soon.

621
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,960
Something very fast.

622
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,420
Unfortunately, balloons seems as sensitive and they're about to attack.

623
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,460
Can you please manage the defense while I gather more data?

624
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,640
I think I can take him on.

625
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,520
I just finished the tutorial.

626
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,800
Um...

627
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,360
Where are these other monkeys?

628
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,820
How much money are you?

629
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,480
Uh...

630
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,460
Uh...

631
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,360
Oh, whoops.

632
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,040
Stop.

633
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,300
Oh, I already fucked it up.

634
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,460
I got confused.

635
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,420
I got confused, okay?

636
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,440
I got really confused, okay?

637
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,440
What do these other monkeys do?

638
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,070
I don't know.

639
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,250
I don't know.

640
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,790
I don't know.

641
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,970
There's so many monkeys.

642
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,290
Which monkey does... Oh, gun.

643
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,030
Gun monkey must be really good.

644
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,220
Right?

645
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,650
Gun monkey go pew pew, I believe.

646
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,120
Okay, gun monkey...

647
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,070
He looks cool.

648
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,080
And then...

649
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,470
You look cool, too.

650
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,410
But I can't put you anywhere.

651
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,070
Alright.

652
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,310
Boomerang monkey, you look cool.

653
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,110
Alright, let's go.

654
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,510
Oh, that's a lot.

655
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,270
I think I'm doing it, guys.

656
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,570
Look at that.

657
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,710
I'm doing it.

658
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,230
Wait, how do you move monkeys?

659
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:05,450
Please.

660
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,550
Okay.

661
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,430
Now they're coming here.

662
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,370
And...

663
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,530
Oh...

664
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,510
You look cool.

665
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,570
Okay.

666
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,570
Yeah.

667
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,770
This is fine.

668
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,610
This should be fine.

669
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,010
Yeah.

670
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,370
We're doing it.

671
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,110
I believe.

672
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:30,890
Oh, okay.

673
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,690
I believe less.

674
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,510
Oh, okay.

675
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:34,330
I still believe.

676
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,750
Alright, nice.

677
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,170
Okay.

678
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,030
Things are going okay.

679
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:39,890
Okay.

680
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,230
Wait, where will they go now?

681
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,400
Wait.

682
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:01,860
Enhance.

683
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,360
Freeze.

684
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,480
Freeze.

685
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,920
I'm...

686
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,420
My head is trying to figure this out.

687
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh.

688
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,960
Oh.

689
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,000
Guys.

690
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,440
It may or may...

691
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:14,820
Oh, wait.

692
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,120
No, it's not over yet.

693
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,520
Wait.

694
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,840
We're okay.

695
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,820
22 rounds?

696
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
What the hell?

697
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,980
Uh...

698
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,760
And then...

699
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,820
Bloon.

700
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:30,880
Bloon.

701
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,380
Okay.

702
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,720
22 rounds.

703
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,140
It's fine.

704
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,500
Where's Quincy?

705
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,040
Where is he?

706
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,100
Where's Quincy?

707
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,560
Oh, no.

708
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,940
Okay.

709
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,420
No, it's still working.

710
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,160
Whatever's happening.

711
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,800
It's even...

712
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,160
The dimensional field line are converging.

713
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,460
Like...

714
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,360
Another universe is approaching.

715
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,300
Oh, we can't stop it.

716
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,420
We can stop the Bloons from...

717
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
Hold them off a little.

718
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,220
Oh.

719
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:55,880
Oh.

720
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,800
Oh.

721
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,080
Oh.

722
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh.

723
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,740
I have every...

724
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,140
I have every...

725
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,560
I have every...

726
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,140
Ninja.

727
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,800
Ninja looks cool.

728
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,040
He look cool.

729
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,580
Okay.

730
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,120
Okay.

731
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,240
Far.

732
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,300
Alright.

733
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,120
There we go.

734
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,500
There we go.

735
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,420
We have...

736
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,380
He look cool.

737
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:28,840
Why...

738
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,740
Why is Ninja not doing anything?

739
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,420
Ninja.

740
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,420
Ninja.

741
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,480
Ninja.

742
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,900
Why aren't you doing...

743
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:34,920
Ninja.

744
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,000
Ninja.

745
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,900
Why did Ninja not do anything?

746
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,080
Oh, he only kills this balloon.

747
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,380
He's out of...

748
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,860
Ninja.

749
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,480
Why are you out of reach?

750
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,100
Why are you out of reach?

751
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,120
Okay.

752
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,260
This is fine.

753
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,280
Okay.

754
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,460
Um...

755
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,160
This is fine.

756
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,660
I have...

757
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,180
Boat.

758
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,420
No, I don't have boat.

759
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,040
I have...

760
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,180
Monkey?

761
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,220
Monkey number two.

762
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,600
I believe.

763
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,840
Monkey number two.

764
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,940
You can't fuck this up for me.

765
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,340
Oh, I'm dead.

766
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,520
Alright.

767
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,140
Let's...

768
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,960
Let's do the tutorial.

769
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,240
Let's...

770
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,460
Let us...

771
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,270
Let us do the regular game.

772
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,360
Guys.

773
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,140
I got...

774
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,060
Very...

775
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,640
Let's just...

776
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,880
Let's just play...

777
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,060
Monkey metal.

778
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,820
Monkey metal sounds nice.

779
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,160
Let's go easy.

780
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,500
Yeah.

781
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,580
Monkey metal.

782
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,340
Monkey...

783
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,020
Alright.

784
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,740
Okay.

785
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,460
That's fine.

786
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,100
Now I feel more safe.

787
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,840
I feel...

788
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,300
I feel very safe now.

789
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:00,740
Wow.

790
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,500
This...

791
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,620
This feels...

792
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,720
Much easier.

793
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,780
Than whatever the fuck I just went through.

794
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,660
Alright.

795
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,100
Nice.

796
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,240
Yay.

797
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,640
Monkey metal.

798
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,720
Oh my god.

799
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,480
Yay, Quincy.

800
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,420
Guys.

801
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,200
Why did you make me do that?

802
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,020
Why?

803
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,980
Guys.

804
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,820
Why did you make me do such a hard level?

805
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,580
Wait.

806
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,640
40 rounds?

807
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,860
Jesus Christ.

808
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,780
Oh fuck.

809
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,240
Okay.

810
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,320
Wait a minute.

811
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,560
I didn't realize there were more to this.

812
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,940
I will do that.

813
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,320
And then we'll upgrade you.

814
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,420
And I think Quincy's already...

815
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,820
This is a group effort.

816
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,660
Alright.

817
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,420
I'll save up for Ice Monkey.

818
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,100
I feel like Ice Monkey is pretty good.

819
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,660
I can't always save up for Ice Monkey.

820
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,720
Alright.

821
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,180
Yay.

822
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,120
There's always a group.

823
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,860
I'm level four!

824
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,540
Let's do the attack shooter.

825
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,940
I want Ice Monkey.

826
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,580
Ice Monkey seems like he knows what he's doing.

827
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Because he's blue.

828
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,920
And he controls...

829
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,680
He literally controls the elements.

830
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,480
He is a superhero at this point.

831
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,140
Alright, Ice Monkey.

832
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,880
You go here.

833
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,180
And then I'm gonna give you this.

834
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,600
Wait.

835
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,100
Yeah.

836
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,380
Let you upgrade that.

837
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:27,980
Alright.

838
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,180
Clap!

839
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,840
Clap for me, Ice Monkey!

840
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,360
Clap!

841
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,540
Yeah, he's literally...

842
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,740
Well, he's not the avatar.

843
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,340
He can control one element.

844
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,340
Um...

845
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,980
This on circular spots?

846
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,520
Like here?

847
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,140
Well, it's not really...

848
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,980
It's half a circle.

849
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,620
But I can't really move them anymore.

850
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,080
Alright.

851
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,880
Clap!

852
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,120
Clap!

853
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,180
Ice Monkey!

854
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,900
Clap for our enjoyment!

855
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,600
Do your thing!

856
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,160
Oh, wait.

857
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
This game is so easy.

858
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,200
When does this get hard?

859
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Oh, shit!

860
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,500
I accidentally...

861
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,180
Castle try almost unlock all.

862
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,940
I...

863
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,180
It would be funny.

864
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,420
I would just pay to win there.

865
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,540
Oh, just...

866
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,220
He's...

867
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,980
Now I don't remember.

868
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
It seems like a...

869
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,560
Game for children.

870
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,240
Alright, let's see.

871
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,620
Do I need permafrost?

872
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,800
I feel like I don't need that.

873
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,680
I feel like...

874
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,740
As long as he can clap...

875
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,980
Things will be okay.

876
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,380
Alright, speed this up for me.

877
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,480
This game is too easy.

878
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,080
Speed...

879
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,640
I want it to be faster.

880
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,660
Oh, wait.

881
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,700
What's this?

882
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,260
Come on.

883
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,920
Come on.

884
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,080
Come on.

885
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,660
Do your thing.

886
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,500
Alright.

887
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,380
Guys, like Doki Keeper.

888
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,900
It says...

889
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,740
Don't mention...

890
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,880
What's mobs?

891
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,720
Thank you for the super chat.

892
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,060
Thank you.

893
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,720
Thank you.

894
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,760
Oh!

895
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,800
Under the settings?

896
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,700
To make it...

897
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,580
Alright, give me Boomerang Monkey.

898
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,400
Wait, what?

899
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:04,940
This?

900
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,280
Oh.

901
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,420
Does it go faster?

902
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,640
I wanna start.

903
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,840
Why is it still so slow?

904
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,380
I thought you said this goes faster.

905
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,560
Oh, it popped.

906
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,060
You know what?

907
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,460
Two.

908
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,060
Make him strong.

909
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,700
Make my monkey strong!

910
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,700
Bottom right?

911
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,760
Yeah.

912
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,880
I'm going as fast as I can.

913
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,280
This is so easy.

914
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,760
Wait.

915
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,100
This round never stopped.

916
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:42,940
Wait, wait a minute.

917
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,500
Shit, wait a minute.

918
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,560
I think now I realize what it means when rounds are on.

919
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,940
Guys, I think I understand what you mean now.

920
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,000
Oh, wait a minute.

921
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,720
Oh, wait a minute.

922
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,500
Okay.

923
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,220
No, it's fine.

924
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,960
These key art will regrow back gloss layers every couple of seconds.

925
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,700
It's fine.

926
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,900
Things are fine.

927
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,880
My blue...

928
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,660
My monkeys are so strong.

929
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,200
I have nothing to worry about.

930
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,000
I have strong monkeys.

931
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,780
Okay.

932
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,920
Unlock these too.

933
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,660
Alright.

934
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,880
Oh my god, he's so cool!

935
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,720
He has glasses!

936
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,360
He's so cool.

937
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,180
There you go.

938
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,240
I don't know how to do anything here.

939
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,220
Are small yet containing two pinks inside them.

940
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,500
Also, black bloons are immune to explosions.

941
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,600
Alright, nice.

942
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,560
Wait, I can put boomerang bloons now.

943
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,560
I'll put boomerang bloons here.

944
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,920
Alright.

945
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,700
And then...

946
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,080
Uh...

947
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,160
Oh shit.

948
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,240
Oh shit.

949
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,640
Wait.

950
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,660
Wait a minute.

951
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,120
Oh fuck, wait a minute.

952
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,600
Let me...

953
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,620
Let me...

954
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,740
Let me slow things down a little bit!

955
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,920
Wait.

956
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,860
Wait, you guys.

957
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,440
Let me...

958
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,960
Let me slow things down a little...

959
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,640
A little bit.

960
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,640
Okay.

961
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,940
Um...

962
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,940
I just realized that...

963
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,840
Things got a little faster.

964
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,280
Okay, upgrade.

965
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,720
Up to eight bloons?

966
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,660
Okay, we want that.

967
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,020
Oh my god, he's wearing red.

968
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,180
Okay, and then we'll do that.

969
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,960
Alright, there you go.

970
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,000
Can it be affected unless they have a way to detect him?

971
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,360
For example, Quincy can be at level five with enhanced eyesight.

972
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

973
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,560
What does enhanced eyesight mean?

974
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,280
Wait, wait, give me a sec.

975
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,160
I need an... oh, there we go.

976
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,300
Okay, we gotta upgrade this.

977
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,260
Okay, uh... Wait, path plus...

978
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,480
Okay,

979
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,140
there we go.

980
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,360
Not closed anymore.

981
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,000
Okay.

982
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,540
Okay, it's not closed anymore.

983
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,300
That's good.

984
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,060
Alright, we have one guy.

985
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,260
We have a bonus guy.

986
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,440
Okay.

987
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,840
Can pop more bloons even.

988
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,560
Yeah, we want that.

989
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,800
And long range.

990
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,680
Let's do that.

991
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,860
Uh... If we ever need it.

992
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,720
I can also build ninja?

993
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,520
I don't have ninja though.

994
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,680
I'm just level seven.

995
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm just a tiny little monkey.

996
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,960
Oh!

997
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,900
Wait, sniper monkey can see camo.

998
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,520
He's wearing camo, right?

999
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,480
Wait, but plain monkey.

1000
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
Oh my god.

1001
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,820
The sky.

1002
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,340
Wait, no.

1003
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,620
I got the sky with me.

1004
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,260
I'm gonna save up for the... I'm gonna save up for plain monkey.

1005
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,820
I have the... I have the sky.

1006
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,720
They combine the meanest of white bloons and black bloons and contain one... Oh wait.

1007
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,720
I can do him.

1008
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,940
Go!

1009
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,840
Go!

1010
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,780
My... My aircraft!

1011
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,460
Go!

1012
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,860
They made a meadow so it can be hurt by tribe bombs.

1013
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,900
Wait, what?

1014
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,980
Wait.

1015
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,320
Wait.

1016
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Wait.

1017
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,480
Oh.

1018
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,280
Is this bomb?

1019
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,800
Is this bomb?

1020
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,520
I...

1021
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,160
Is this... Is this... Oh shit!

1022
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,160
I got... Oh shit!

1023
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:39,380
I got... I got... I got confused!

1024
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,360
Oh come on.

1025
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,020
Oh!

1026
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,400
I was like...

1027
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,680
What bomb?

1028
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,720
What?

1029
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,360
What makes it go...

1030
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,000
I got... I got confused.

1031
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,900
Oh.

1032
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,640
Okay, glue monkey.

1033
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,520
You can't...

1034
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,320
Tell me.

1035
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,440
Alright.

1036
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,840
It's okay.

1037
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,400
It's okay.

1038
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,580
Things are fine now.

1039
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,460
Things are fine.

1040
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,600
Uh.

1041
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,040
You know what?

1042
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,300
I want pineapple.

1043
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,960
There we go.

1044
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,340
Um.

1045
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,300
Oh shit.

1046
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,220
Okay, I need...

1047
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,580
Please.

1048
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,240
I need a...

1049
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:17,660
Please.

1050
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,400
I need money.

1051
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:18,900
Please.

1052
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,940
I... I need money.

1053
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,900
Please.

1054
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Oh no.

1055
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,180
Okay.

1056
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,180
There we go.

1057
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,540
There we go.

1058
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,460
Extra range.

1059
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:29,800
There.

1060
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,400
Things will be fine, guys.

1061
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,440
I have pineapple.

1062
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,120
Is this...

1063
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,520
I think this position is pretty good.

1064
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,700
I think...

1065
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:39,960
Alright.

1066
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Now we unlock sniper monkey.

1067
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,500
Okay.

1068
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,000
Here we go.

1069
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,060
There we go.

1070
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,240
I figured it out, guys.

1071
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,420
Now I have range.

1072
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,560
I have range, guys.

1073
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,640
I figured it out.

1074
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
And then...

1075
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,480
Shoots faster.

1076
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,440
Darts can pop.

1077
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:58,940
You know what?

1078
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,460
Yeah.

1079
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,620
Too faster.

1080
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,360
Yeah.

1081
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,720
Okay.

1082
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,840
Um.

1083
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,840
XP?

1084
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,620
I have XP.

1085
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,020
How much XP does my dart monkey have?

1086
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,520
Oh, fuck.

1087
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,680
Fuck up.

1088
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,380
Ah.

1089
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,680
Ah.

1090
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,620
I have...

1091
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,460
My brain.

1092
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,180
Yes.

1093
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,040
Okay.

1094
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,640
Nice.

1095
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,920
Can't...

1096
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,060
Ah.

1097
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,760
Fuck.

1098
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,880
Brain.

1099
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,360
Brain hurt.

1100
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,680
Brain.

1101
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,340
Anybody share sims?

1102
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:40,840
Thank you.

1103
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,980
This is super chat.

1104
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,540
Thank you.

1105
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,040
Thank you.

1106
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,620
Okay.

1107
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,160
Sniper.

1108
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,560
Sniper!

1109
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,120
Sniper, right here.

1110
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,480
It's fine.

1111
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,040
Just a couple more.

1112
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,460
No, it's okay.

1113
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,480
I got it.

1114
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,860
I'm cutting out blue.

1115
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,540
No, I figured it out, guys.

1116
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,000
I figured it out.

1117
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,480
Okay, fuck.

1118
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,020
Five-year-old auntie.

1119
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,740
He's got infinite range.

1120
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,820
All right, nice.

1121
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,900
Okay, now I can be fast again.

1122
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,580
I just realized I haven't been fast for a long time.

1123
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,440
Things were... Oh my god, I got a little dizzy.

1124
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,280
There's too many things going on.

1125
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,000
You what?

1126
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,760
Mortar.

1127
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,980
Okay, I need you... I need you to... Where's Camo?

1128
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,360
Okay, I need you to be able to do all of this, little monkey.

1129
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,160
I... I need you...

1130
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,760
I need you to do something.

1131
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,880
I need all my monkeys to do something.

1132
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,860
Okay, here we go.

1133
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,480
Here we go.

1134
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,620
I believe in my monkeys.

1135
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,720
And then...

1136
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,740
Bigger bombs.

1137
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,810
Surely, bigger bombs means a...

1138
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,980
Means bigger hits.

1139
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,060
Surely.

1140
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:14,980
All right.

1141
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,720
There you go.

1142
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,840
You have cannons now.

1143
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,800
All right.

1144
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,940
No, I'm just so...

1145
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,320
I'm just so confused.

1146
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,280
I...

1147
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,120
I'm just...

1148
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,200
I'm just...

1149
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,180
Incredibly confused, guys.

1150
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,700
I...

1151
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,340
All right.

1152
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,400
Things are fine, though.

1153
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,460
Oh!

1154
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,400
Oh!

1155
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,440
I was like...

1156
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,900
Why...

1157
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,880
Why he no pop?

1158
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,860
Okay, I need you to be able to do that.

1159
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,640
Okay, I need you to be able to see that, too.

1160
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,100
Okay.

1161
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,260
Frag bombs.

1162
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,280
There you go.

1163
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,220
You go do your thing.

1164
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,240
And then...

1165
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,940
I'm level 10!

1166
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,240
More snipers with night vision?

1167
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,900
All right, let me...

1168
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,240
I'm unlocking so many things, but like, I'm too...

1169
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,840
I'm too overwhelmed to do more stuff.

1170
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,380
Night vision.

1171
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:15,780
Okay.

1172
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,180
Night vision.

1173
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:18,560
Night vision.

1174
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:18,960
There we go.

1175
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,000
That should be fine.

1176
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,100
And then...

1177
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,520
You get camo, too.

1178
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,960
And...

1179
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,860
You know what?

1180
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,200
I should be upgrading you.

1181
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,240
I don't know why I was not doing that.

1182
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,800
Faster throwing...

1183
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,660
I don't know.

1184
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,520
That seems like a cool thing to upgrade.

1185
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,680
I don't know.

1186
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,280
These...

1187
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,380
Take loads, and when they do, they...

1188
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,620
What?

1189
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,420
What?

1190
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:43,840
Wait.

1191
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,520
Oh my god, thank god.

1192
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,500
Okay, they broke.

1193
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,000
Okay, I got scared.

1194
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,380
I...

1195
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,560
I got really scared.

1196
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,060
You guys just...

1197
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,960
Oh, I did it!

1198
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,040
Not even close!

1199
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,220
Die!

1200
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,660
Cyclone, thank you for the super chat.

1201
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,780
Thank you, thank you.

1202
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,820
There's been this person outside my house these past few days making crow sounds and then leaving.

1203
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,480
I feel awkward to tell you this.

1204
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,560
Thank you for the super chat.

1205
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,380
Thank you, thank you.

1206
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,100
And Todd, thank you for the super chat.

1207
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,960
Thank you, thank you.

1208
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,300
I'm cutting up, dude.

1209
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,380
Oh my god.

1210
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,420
This was incredibly overwhelming.

1211
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:20,940
Wait.

1212
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,500
If I do free play, do I get more?

1213
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,040
Do I get more...

1214
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,860
More out of it?

1215
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,680
What do I get out of it?

1216
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,760
For free play.

1217
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,620
I should start upgrading my stuff.

1218
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,800
That was so easy, guys.

1219
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,360
I wonder when things get hard.

1220
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,520
Make a little effect.

1221
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,520
Glue through.

1222
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,820
Soaks through all that.

1223
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,540
It's just...

1224
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,100
Oh, you actually get less experience.

1225
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,680
More XP for...

1226
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,800
Oh, it's not worth it?

1227
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,920
Okay, goodbye monkeys.

1228
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,180
How do I leave?

1229
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,640
Goodbye monkeys.

1230
00:44:59,520 --> 00:44:59,880
Alright.

1231
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,200
Not now.

1232
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,560
I don't need to back it up.

1233
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,580
Wait, can I unlock other monkeys?

1234
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, I have to...

1235
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,980
It's like quest.

1236
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
Okay, so all I can have is Quincy.

1237
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,860
Help Quincy with a little help.

1238
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,900
What do I get out of it?

1239
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,720
Wait, what do I get if I help Quincy?

1240
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,640
He's an archer with amazing accuracy.

1241
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,500
Alright.

1242
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,520
Okay.

1243
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,580
Doesn't seem all too bad if it's just Quincy.

1244
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:32,840
Right?

1245
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:35,880
Alright.

1246
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:38,840
Yeah.

1247
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,200
Doesn't seem all too bad.

1248
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,720
I'm just gonna use Quincy.

1249
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,300
Nothing get past Quincy's bow.

1250
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,380
Hawkeye wishes he was him.

1251
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,540
Looks like there are too many.

1252
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,860
Use Quincy's rapid shot.

1253
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,500
Oh, I just...

1254
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,440
Oh, I do have it again.

1255
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,260
Yay!

1256
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,440
Nice.

1257
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,680
Doesn't seem all too bad.

1258
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,900
Nothing gets past Quincy.

1259
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,180
Every third that lemon popped lead balloons.

1260
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,800
Oh shit.

1261
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,080
He's so strong now.

1262
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,600
He's uneven.

1263
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,400
I think he's better than Hawkeye.

1264
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,940
Wait.

1265
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,640
Quincy.

1266
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,420
Quincy.

1267
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:20,900
Quincy.

1268
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,420
You...

1269
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,360
You left him.

1270
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,300
Quincy, what the fuck?

1271
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,620
Quincy, what the fuck?

1272
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:31,960
How did you fuck up?

1273
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,120
How did you...

1274
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,240
Quincy, what the fuck?

1275
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,340
How did you fuck up?

1276
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:36,980
Quincy!

1277
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,220
Shoot him!

1278
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,860
He can't do everything.

1279
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,140
What's the point if he can't do everything himself?

1280
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,780
What's the point?

1281
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,700
He's throwing.

1282
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:51,480
He's throwing.

1283
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,980
Don't spam your...

1284
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,420
If they gave me abilities, I might as well be allowed to spam them.

1285
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,320
On cooldown.

1286
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,680
Wait, these abilities are so fast.

1287
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,000
Oh, I think it's because it's the game itself spam.

1288
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,320
Oh, it's because I finished the round.

1289
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,780
Oh, it's because I've auto-started.

1290
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:14,800
Alright.

1291
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,600
Nice.

1292
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,660
Nice.

1293
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,380
Okay, not nice.

1294
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,180
This might be where Quincy dies.

1295
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,900
Guys, why didn't you tell me to stop spamming?

1296
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,580
Why?

1297
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,980
Guys.

1298
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,260
Guys, why didn't you stop me?

1299
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,920
Oh, I can use other monkeys!

1300
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,480
Oh, shit!

1301
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,520
Um...

1302
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,460
Okay.

1303
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,660
Here we go.

1304
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,060
Ice monkey.

1305
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,620
Ice monkey, do your thing!

1306
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,740
Oh, shit.

1307
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,280
Ice monkey, do your thing!

1308
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,760
Quincy can't do all of this himself!

1309
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:50,720
Come on!

1310
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,400
Okay, he's maxed out.

1311
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,300
Uh...

1312
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,480
Go, ice monkey, go!

1313
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,200
Oh, shit!

1314
00:47:59,300 --> 00:47:59,860
I sold him!

1315
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,160
Sorry, ice monkey!

1316
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,940
Do your thing again!

1317
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,880
Oh, fuck!

1318
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,140
Um...

1319
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:04,680
Um, sniper!

1320
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:07,300
Uh...

1321
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,020
Cannon!

1322
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,680
Ability!

1323
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,500
Oh, come on!

1324
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,620
Ability!

1325
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,500
Oh, my God!

1326
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,020
It is...

1327
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,580
Oh, don't.

1328
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,740
Oh, don't.

1329
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:19,660
Oh, don't.

1330
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:20,900
Ability!

1331
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,700
It's fine.

1332
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,100
It's fine.

1333
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,320
Nothing to worry about.

1334
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,020
We made it.

1335
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,640
We made it.

1336
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,320
We made it, guys.

1337
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:29,580
We...

1338
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,820
We made it!

1339
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,360
Nothing to worry about.

1340
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,020
We made it!

1341
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,620
We still have ability!

1342
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,000
Yeah.

1343
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,940
Jesus Christ, this is a little too close.

1344
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,660
It's a little too close for comfort, guys.

1345
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,560
Oh, no.

1346
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,460
Oh, no.

1347
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,780
Okay.

1348
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:48,680
Yay!

1349
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:49,940
We did it!

1350
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,220
This is not Quincy's fault.

1351
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,100
What?

1352
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,600
And it's...

1353
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,960
You think it's my fault?

1354
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,340
Wait till she finds out that was just a baby.

1355
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,200
They're...

1356
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,580
Wait, they get bigger?

1357
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,300
AKB, thank you for the super chat.

1358
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,260
Thank you, thank you.

1359
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,460
Prom, Amaro, thank you for the super chat.

1360
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,400
Thank you, thank you.

1361
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,360
Alright, nice.

1362
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,020
I did it.

1363
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,640
It's pretty easy.

1364
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,120
Alright, nice.

1365
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,900
I got power, energizing, and super monkey storm.

1366
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,400
What do I do with those?

1367
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:23,820
Okay.

1368
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,700
Wait, is there more stuff for Quincy?

1369
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,220
No, that's like tutorial.

1370
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,220
What's this?

1371
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh, I get to unlock.

1372
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,540
Oh, are these skins?

1373
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,280
Why would I use my money on skins?

1374
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,560
I could use it on more monkeys.

1375
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,360
Oh!

1376
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,640
Okay, so I can do more there.

1377
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,760
Monkey money can be spent on new heroes.

1378
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,000
Are permanent upgrades?

1379
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,840
Is permanent upgrades these?

1380
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,740
Are these the permanent upgrades?

1381
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,220
Skins equals win, of course.

1382
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,740
God, Doki.

1383
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,420
It's like you don't know how to play...

1384
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,200
How to play mobile games.

1385
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,620
Monkey knowledge?

1386
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,840
Where's monkey knowledge?

1387
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:16,920
Where's monkey knowledge?

1388
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,920
Is she monkey knowledge because she has glasses?

1389
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,140
Oh, not unlocked yet.

1390
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,780
Oh.

1391
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,020
Okay.

1392
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,600
Oh, this one.

1393
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,380
I see it.

1394
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,500
Oh!

1395
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,180
What the fuck?

1396
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,060
What?

1397
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,140
What?

1398
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,420
What about...

1399
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:41,960
Oh, fuck.

1400
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,740
Guys, bloons is a lot more complicated than I thought.

1401
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:49,720
I hate bloons.

1402
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,320
Medium?

1403
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,460
Blue is more normal.

1404
00:50:59,640 --> 00:50:59,720
Yeah.

1405
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,580
Beating round 60.

1406
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,280
A war to a silver.

1407
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,080
Melon.

1408
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,530
$75.

1409
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:20,990
Yeah.

1410
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,330
Let's just keep going on easy, guys.

1411
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,090
Let's...

1412
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,310
Let's...

1413
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,270
Let's...

1414
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,490
Let's stay here a little longer.

1415
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,210
Guys.

1416
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,330
Let's stay here.

1417
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,750
Let's stay here a little longer.

1418
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,930
Enjoy our time.

1419
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,930
In monkey meadows.

1420
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,090
Guys, it's $75.

1421
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,170
$75 is $75, okay?

1422
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,490
I'm just enjoying my time.

1423
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,410
In...

1424
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,910
In monkey meadows.

1425
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:53,690
Okay.

1426
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:56,310
Alright.

1427
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,230
Just trying to have a good time.

1428
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,390
Oh.

1429
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:03,670
Oh, that's fast.

1430
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,630
That's fast.

1431
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,150
Okay.

1432
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,390
Alright.

1433
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,490
A little slow and steady.

1434
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,010
Slow and steady wins the race.

1435
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,090
Slow and steady.

1436
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,110
Alright.

1437
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:24,690
It's fine.

1438
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:25,590
Okay.

1439
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,090
We just need to save up for...

1440
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,370
Ice monkey.

1441
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,670
The moment we have ice monkey, things will get easier.

1442
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,890
Oh, don't level up the hero?

1443
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,470
Oops.

1444
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:38,470
Alright.

1445
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:41,750
There we go.

1446
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:42,790
Clap!

1447
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,790
Clap for me!

1448
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,890
I trust him.

1449
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,550
Get yourself a girl that trust...

1450
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,590
That trust you unconditionally like...

1451
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,050
Ice monkey trust...

1452
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:58,110
Like how I trust ice monkey.

1453
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,350
Go clap!

1454
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:03,850
Do your job!

1455
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,530
I believe in you!

1456
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,150
You're doing great, sweetie!

1457
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,250
I'm gonna get this just in case.

1458
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:14,590
I don't...

1459
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,770
I'm gonna get this.

1460
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,230
I don't...

1461
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,370
I'm worried about the meadow man.

1462
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,970
I'm afraid of the meadow man.

1463
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:23,470
Alright.

1464
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:24,470
Stickier glue?

1465
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,910
Or...

1466
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:26,250
You know what?

1467
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,570
I feel like it should be both.

1468
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,490
This one, right?

1469
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,230
It seems better.

1470
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,110
Okay.

1471
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,430
We need more ice monkey.

1472
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,590
Ice monkey seems really strong.

1473
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:40,610
Okay.

1474
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,830
Alright.

1475
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,530
Ice monkey!

1476
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,590
You know what?

1477
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,130
Fuck it.

1478
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,430
I need almost close to end up more ice monkey.

1479
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,190
Do your thing!

1480
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,470
Keep clapping!

1481
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,050
I'm almost close to more ice monkey!

1482
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,570
Ariel.

1483
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,810
What's permafrost?

1484
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,530
Plutus must slowly even when...

1485
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,930
Is this even a worthy upgrade?

1486
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,610
Oh, it is.

1487
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,010
Alright.

1488
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,470
We'll do that and...

1489
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,470
We'll do permafrost and enhance freeze.

1490
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,330
Two ice monkey is better than one ice monkey.

1491
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,970
You know...

1492
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,630
That's what I'm saying!

1493
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:23,810
Nice.

1494
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:24,490
Okay.

1495
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,870
We'll get sticky or glue.

1496
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,390
We like it when things get sticky!

1497
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:32,630
Ice monkey.

1498
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,290
You know what?

1499
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,510
I think I can make an entire army of just ice monkey.

1500
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:38,830
Oh, wait.

1501
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,200
Yay!

1502
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,120
My chicken soup!

1503
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,860
Keep doing your thing.

1504
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,140
Keep looking cool!

1505
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,880
More ice monkey!

1506
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,980
Come on!

1507
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:54,580
Come on!

1508
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,000
Don't worry.

1509
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,400
You know what this needs?

1510
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,820
More ice monkey.

1511
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,760
Alright.

1512
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,060
We gotta make him look cooler.

1513
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,700
And then...

1514
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,280
Here.

1515
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,700
And...

1516
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,220
We'll have larger freeze area.

1517
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,320
Yay!

1518
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,180
Level 12!

1519
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,800
Alright.

1520
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:13,900
Larger radius.

1521
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,700
There we go.

1522
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:15,880
That's what we need.

1523
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,580
More ice...

1524
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,000
The world needs more ice monkey.

1525
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,720
Alright.

1526
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:21,840
Yes.

1527
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,640
Surely that's not gonna backfire, right?

1528
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,520
Hahaha!

1529
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,800
Surely...

1530
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,280
That's not gonna fuck me over, right, guys?

1531
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,340
The world just needed more ice monkey.

1532
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,940
I mean, it's working!

1533
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,140
I think.

1534
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,820
You know what we need?

1535
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,520
More ice monkey!

1536
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,840
Hahaha!

1537
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:44,660
Hahaha!

1538
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,220
That's right!

1539
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,860
Keep doing your thing!

1540
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,080
I gotta upgrade it.

1541
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,600
There you go.

1542
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,480
Yes, but you would not listen anyway!

1543
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,720
I think you don't!

1544
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,260
Oops!

1545
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:01,600
Ah!

1546
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,580
Ice monkey!

1547
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,180
I'm just saying.

1548
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,940
I think...

1549
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,280
More ice monkey is always the plan.

1550
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,740
Everybody loves ice monkey!

1551
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,080
Yay!

1552
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,780
Level 13!

1553
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Monkey money!

1554
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,060
Alright.

1555
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,000
See?

1556
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,060
It's all working out!

1557
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,600
They're freezing everything!

1558
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,620
It's all ice!

1559
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,520
Look at that!

1560
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,900
Look at him go!

1561
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,680
Okay, I need to do this.

1562
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,260
Hahaha!

1563
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,100
I may or may not be a little worried right now.

1564
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,280
But it's okay.

1565
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,040
I'll never doubt you, ice monkey.

1566
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,300
Uh...

1567
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,340
Don't sleep.

1568
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,780
I'll never doubt you.

1569
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,820
My little monkeys.

1570
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,220
Alright.

1571
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,060
I just gotta save.

1572
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,640
Hope you're ready for more.

1573
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,260
It's okay.

1574
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,020
My ice monkey sees through all.

1575
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,640
My ice monkey can see through everything.

1576
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,520
Okay.

1577
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,000
We need to shoot smaller ice bombs.

1578
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,480
That slows blooms and frees water.

1579
00:56:59,660 --> 00:56:59,780
Okay.

1580
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,600
We...

1581
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,240
Okay.

1582
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,840
There you go!

1583
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,700
Keep using more!

1584
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:08,940
Alright.

1585
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,340
You know what?

1586
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:09,780
I'll give you...

1587
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,620
I'll give you more sticky.

1588
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,920
I think I can put more...

1589
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,020
Wait.

1590
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,120
Actually, I should save up.

1591
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,180
I should actually...

1592
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,180
Alright.

1593
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,160
You're right.

1594
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:19,860
I need...

1595
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,200
Wait.

1596
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:20,820
Did I do it?

1597
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:21,500
Yay!

1598
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:21,800
Yay!

1599
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,420
Oh shit!

1600
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,480
Don't worry.

1601
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,280
I got...

1602
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,320
I got the plan.

1603
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,140
Don't worry!

1604
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,120
I got the plan!

1605
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,220
I got the plan!

1606
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,600
Dude!

1607
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,620
Don't worry!

1608
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,360
He's here!

1609
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,320
They're all here!

1610
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,840
All my monkeys know what they're doing!

1611
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,060
Alright.

1612
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:49,540
Nice.

1613
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,180
Let's upgrade.

1614
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:50,940
Oh my god!

1615
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,080
Super...

1616
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,440
Super brittle!

1617
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:54,800
Do I have enough?

1618
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,600
Okay.

1619
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:57,880
Wait.

1620
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,080
Enough here.

1621
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,040
And then...

1622
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,640
We'll...

1623
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,680
Upgrade this guy.

1624
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,780
Oh, we should upgrade him.

1625
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,020
But he doesn't matter as much.

1626
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,040
Let it go.

1627
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,620
They think it can get past my army of ice monkeys.

1628
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,300
Foolish bloons!

1629
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,060
So foolish!

1630
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,260
Welcome to Canada!

1631
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,900
Oh shit.

1632
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,500
Wait.

1633
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,100
Oh, okay.

1634
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:26,540
I...

1635
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,580
I got a little word.

1636
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,300
Nice.

1637
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,980
I wonder what Stokey's favorite monkey is.

1638
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,240
He can't...

1639
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,380
Guys, I think she likes Ice Monkey.

1640
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,580
I'm just saying!

1641
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,500
Ice Monkey's pretty strong!

1642
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,380
He's pretty fucking strong.

1643
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,340
Not gonna lie.

1644
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:50,980
Wait.

1645
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,860
He only has one?

1646
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,140
Wait.

1647
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,760
Which is better?

1648
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,220
Quincy or...

1649
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,020
Gwendolyn?

1650
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,500
Quincy actually...

1651
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:58,720
Wait.

1652
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,540
Which is better?

1653
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,180
Quincy or Gwendolyn?

1654
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,440
Should we tell her?

1655
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,140
Gwen?

1656
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,060
Alright, let's check her out.

1657
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,360
Let's check out what she does.

1658
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,080
Uh, Duck!

1659
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,080
Thank you for the super chat!

1660
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,980
Thank you!

1661
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,280
Ice Monkey was the lunar snow of our times.

1662
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,640
Clapping while no one else could.

1663
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,220
He's just a chill guy.

1664
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,920
Fire can solve any problems.

1665
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,400
Gwen can take out leads with ease.

1666
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,680
As she...

1667
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:26,980
Levels...

1668
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,780
Up...

1669
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,620
She buffs...

1670
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,300
Taliter towers.

1671
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,660
Especially the ones with fire attacks.

1672
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,060
Okay.

1673
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,360
What'd she do?

1674
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,060
Alright, do your thing, Gwen.

1675
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:37,860
Boom.

1676
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,520
What the fuck?

1677
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,120
She just let two through.

1678
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:44,700
Hello?

1679
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,120
Gwen?

1680
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,800
Shoot them!

1681
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:51,720
What?

1682
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,440
Gwen!

1683
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:02,260
What?

1684
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,640
She just let two through!

1685
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,640
They put her there!

1686
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,280
They put her there!

1687
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,460
They put her there!

1688
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,100
Like, what am I supposed to do?

1689
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,620
Okay.

1690
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,760
It's not my fault if they put her there by themselves!

1691
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,020
Wait, what?

1692
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,100
Oh, here.

1693
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,620
Okay.

1694
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,030
Stupid fucking...

1695
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:34,940
Gwen...

1696
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,340
Gwen...

1697
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,320
I fucking...

1698
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:36,860
Okay.

1699
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,720
Alright, Gwendolyn.

1700
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:39,560
I...

1701
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,880
Goodbye.

1702
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,840
How did I lose in the tutorial on Gwendolyn?

1703
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:49,940
Like...

1704
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:51,900
Alright.

1705
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,240
That's fine.

1706
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,220
Gwen's height makes her a good hero for saving up...

1707
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:56,520
Alright.

1708
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,160
Now I know.

1709
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,240
Alright.

1710
01:00:59,400 --> 01:00:59,940
This is fine.

1711
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,000
I put it down.

1712
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,440
Surely...

1713
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,640
Surely I'll be fine now.

1714
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,400
Surely.

1715
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:07,780
Alright.

1716
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,960
I was set up to fail.

1717
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,460
There's a lot about to come up.

1718
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,820
Wait till they're all on screen and use the Firestorm ability to put them down.

1719
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:16,240
Okay.

1720
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,780
I think that's all of them, right?

1721
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,740
I can't...

1722
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,200
I'm just set up to fail.

1723
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm...

1724
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,640
I'm just set up!

1725
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,440
I'm just...

1726
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,240
Okay.

1727
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:27,920
Alright.

1728
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:29,620
Restart.

1729
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:29,900
Restart.

1730
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:30,060
Clearly.

1731
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:30,600
Okay.

1732
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,120
Okay.

1733
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,060
I figured it out.

1734
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:32,680
Guys.

1735
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,720
I figured it out.

1736
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:36,860
Alright.

1737
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,640
This is fine.

1738
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,780
I know what to do now.

1739
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,280
I know what to do.

1740
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,940
It's just Gwen things.

1741
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:46,980
Balloons.

1742
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,560
Okay.

1743
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,740
Those balloons will never be popped.

1744
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,160
I guess.

1745
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,780
I did!

1746
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,910
I thought that was all of them!

1747
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:59,130
I got a little quirky, okay?

1748
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,070
I thought that was all of them.

1749
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,610
The Crusher button?

1750
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:05,930
What's the Crusher button?

1751
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:08,650
What's that?

1752
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,490
What?

1753
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:10,870
What?

1754
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,150
There's no Crusher button here.

1755
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:15,230
Alright.

1756
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,870
Pass through.

1757
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,650
Oh, on the map?

1758
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:21,770
There's something on...

1759
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:22,150
Oh!

1760
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:23,590
Oh!

1761
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:24,570
Too late.

1762
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,730
Too late.

1763
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:33,450
I crushed...

1764
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:33,930
Alright.

1765
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:38,450
It's gone.

1766
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:42,930
Whoops.

1767
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,510
Does it go back up?

1768
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:47,890
Guys, when does it...

1769
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:48,850
Okay, it goes back up.

1770
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:49,390
Okay, guys.

1771
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,790
It's okay.

1772
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:50,650
I figured it out.

1773
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,550
Alright.

1774
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:53,950
It's okay, guys.

1775
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:55,490
I learned my lesson.

1776
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:56,950
Alright.

1777
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:01,810
Is that all of them?

1778
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:02,750
It's gone.

1779
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:03,650
Okay.

1780
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:04,210
Nice.

1781
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:04,970
I got it.

1782
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:05,830
Alright.

1783
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,390
Add some towers and complete the rest of the rounds.

1784
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,230
Oh, shit.

1785
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:11,330
Oh, shit.

1786
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,350
Um...

1787
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,090
Uh...

1788
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:19,510
Um...

1789
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:20,710
Uh...

1790
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:22,030
Uh...

1791
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,400
I learned.

1792
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,060
It's okay.

1793
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:28,900
I...

1794
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,240
I'm...

1795
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,980
I'm gonna play the game now.

1796
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,260
I'm gonna play...

1797
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,580
I just...

1798
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,740
It's okay.

1799
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,700
I figured it out.

1800
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,260
But you can't earn any more.

1801
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:40,940
Oh.

1802
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,490
Ice monkey.

1803
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:49,790
Ice monkey.

1804
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:52,110
Ice monkey.

1805
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,590
Ice monkey.

1806
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:54,830
Ice monkey.

1807
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,660
Ice monkey.

1808
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,180
Ice monkey will never fail me.

1809
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,380
Ice.

1810
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:05,900
Ice.

1811
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:15,380
I believe... I believe in the power of ice.

1812
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,540
Don't worry.

1813
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,440
Oh no!

1814
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,720
I believe... I believe in the power of ice.

1815
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,660
Don't worry.

1816
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,080
Ice monkey.

1817
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,440
Ice monkey's time to shine.

1818
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,620
Chad, are we cooked?

1819
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,260
How can we be cooked?

1820
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
We have ice monkey.

1821
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:44,020
Alright, I'm gonna go get my chicken soup.

1822
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,460
Ice monkey will cover for me.

1823
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,580
I did it!

1824
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,200
Yay!

1825
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,060
Oh, ninja monkey.

1826
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,280
I got my chicken soup, guys.

1827
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:09,880
Look at that!

1828
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,140
Ice monkey's doing it!

1829
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,620
How could he fail?

1830
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,060
How can he fail?

1831
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,040
Exactly!

1832
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,160
Look at him go!

1833
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,600
Don't worry.

1834
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,720
My ice monkey can see through camo.

1835
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,460
I think.

1836
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,800
I might have forgot what I upgraded.

1837
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,260
But I think he can... I think it's possible.

1838
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,280
Go ice monkey!

1839
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:38,720
Go!

1840
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,320
I believe.

1841
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,420
Look at him!

1842
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,200
Look at him clap!

1843
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,900
Keep clapping!

1844
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,240
Keep clapping!

1845
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,260
If you believe hard enough, ice monkey can get us through the finish line.

1846
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,860
Oh, only two monkeys can see camo.

1847
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

1848
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,080
Ice monkey reigns supreme.

1849
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,580
As long as they keep clapping, nothing can kill me.

1850
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,180
My chicken soup!

1851
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,360
Hmm.

1852
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,500
You see, the problem is...

1853
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,960
Oh, I was on slow this entire time.

1854
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:26,460
Whoops.

1855
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,840
That was like, wow.

1856
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,660
Ice monkey is so strong.

1857
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,480
I mean, we're almost halfway.

1858
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,080
Don't...

1859
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,180
I love tropicos.

1860
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,760
Thank you for the 50 gifted shows.

1861
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,940
Thank you, thank you!

1862
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,000
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1863
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,280
Thank you, thank you!

1864
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:52,880
See, look at that!

1865
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,460
My two monkeys doing it!

1866
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,340
They saw through the camo!

1867
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,080
Famous last words?

1868
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,580
It's so...

1869
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:11,740
It's so doable!

1870
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,400
You got the...

1871
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,200
Yeah!

1872
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,040
The surviving blues are doing nothing!

1873
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,680
They can't even get past my bridge of ice!

1874
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,440
Firebomb!

1875
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:36,740
Firebomb!

1876
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:37,320
Firebomb that shit!

1877
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,040
Gwen!

1878
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,580
Does she know?

1879
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,140
Oh my god!

1880
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:44,900
Super monkey!

1881
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,660
I got Superman on my side!

1882
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,320
Oh my god!

1883
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,440
Oh my god!

1884
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:53,600
Goodbye!

1885
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,160
Oh shit!

1886
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,780
Guys...

1887
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,200
616?!

1888
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,600
Okay guys...

1889
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,620
I think...

1890
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,960
I think Ice Monkey was not it.

1891
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,320
Who would've thought...

1892
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:17,340
Who would've thought...

1893
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:17,920
Okay, what do we do?

1894
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,380
Two Ice Monkeys...

1895
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,120
And then we'll do...

1896
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,240
This guy...

1897
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,000
Right here...

1898
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,380
And then...

1899
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,120
We'll upgrade...

1900
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,320
Range...

1901
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:28,860
And then...

1902
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,340
Super Range...

1903
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,840
And then we'll put Sniper Monkey...

1904
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,900
And then...

1905
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,140
Plane Monkey...

1906
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,680
And then...

1907
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,260
Another Ice Monkey...

1908
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,800
Cause they never fail me!

1909
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah...

1910
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,780
Ice Monkey will never fail me!

1911
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:47,840
Alright...

1912
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,680
And then I'll start...

1913
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,940
Upgrading other stuff...

1914
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,680
And then...

1915
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,960
Alright...

1916
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,800
There we go...

1917
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,600
There we go...

1918
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,300
I think...

1919
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,040
I think we're five...

1920
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,260
And then another Ice Monkey...

1921
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,460
There we go...

1922
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:08,260
Now we have the strat guys...

1923
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,620
Now...

1924
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,460
Now we have the strat...

1925
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,370
There we go...

1926
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,480
I think this is it...

1927
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,260
I think this is the strat guys...

1928
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,960
This is...

1929
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:20,940
This is the right...

1930
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,260
This is the real strat...

1931
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,560
You know what you're right...

1932
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,510
I should add one more Ice Monkey...

1933
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,760
For the ride...

1934
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,820
Let's just...

1935
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,500
Add one more...

1936
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,560
Just to be sure...

1937
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,000
Hmm...

1938
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,820
It's okay...

1939
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,380
You know what...

1940
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:42,760
You're right...

1941
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,780
I'll add two more...

1942
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,760
That was our main issue...

1943
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,850
We needed two more Ice Monkeys...

1944
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,820
And then...

1945
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,760
Here we go...

1946
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,040
There we go...

1947
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,800
There we go...

1948
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,180
It's perfect now...

1949
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,240
Now this is perfect...

1950
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:03,900
Honestly...

1951
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,900
Honestly...

1952
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,260
I think...

1953
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,120
I think I got it...

1954
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,360
I figured it out...

1955
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,040
I definitely figured it out guys...

1956
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,600
This is...

1957
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,820
This is what we forgot to do...

1958
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,020
I think...

1959
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:22,860
I think...

1960
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,500
I think this is the real strat...

1961
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,920
How could I mess this up?

1962
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,000
How could I possibly...

1963
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,360
Mess this up now?

1964
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:36,660
Hahaha...

1965
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,040
The true meta...

1966
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,700
It will always work...

1967
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,920
Until it doesn't...

1968
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,060
Alright...

1969
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,760
As soon as the big guy comes over...

1970
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,060
I'll know...

1971
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,340
I'll know what I did wrong...

1972
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:00,820
Hahaha...

1973
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,020
She didn't know...

1974
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:05,200
Hahaha...

1975
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,980
It's okay...

1976
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,060
I leveled up!

1977
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:10,700
I want...

1978
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,300
Wizard Monkey...

1979
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,060
Here we go...

1980
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,100
Watch this...

1981
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:16,940
Alright...

1982
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:17,920
And that freeze...

1983
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,020
See?

1984
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:19,620
There you go!

1985
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,640
I figured it out!

1986
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,060
I told you...

1987
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,920
That's what I was missing all along...

1988
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,560
I knew it!

1989
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,800
I knew it!

1990
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:30,280
I knew it guys!

1991
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,540
I was missing two more Ice Monkeys!

1992
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:33,840
That was...

1993
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,940
What I needed!

1994
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,940
I just needed two more!

1995
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,500
Now it's over!

1996
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,870
I just needed to use my abilities!

1997
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,510
There you go!

1998
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,990
I'm gonna save the freeze one for later...

1999
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,490
I feel like...

2000
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:58,630
I feel like...

2001
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:01,150
The freeze one matters more later on in the line...

2002
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,950
Alright...

2003
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:04,650
Firebomb!

2004
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,390
The bloons have extra armor...

2005
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,930
Making them even tougher to pop!

2006
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,270
Nothing is too tough for my Ice Monkeys!

2007
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:12,650
Alright...

2008
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:13,110
There we go!

2009
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:14,590
Look at them go!

2010
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:15,210
Look at them!

2011
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,390
They're denying everything!

2012
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,170
I've always believed in you!

2013
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,050
Firebomb!

2014
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,430
They can't even get past this part!

2015
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,690
That's how good they are!

2016
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:27,070
Look at them go!

2017
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:30,830
How am I cooked?

2018
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:31,790
I'm literally...

2019
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,530
It's so easy right now!

2020
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,090
I put Firebomb in here!

2021
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:36,950
They can't do shit!

2022
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:38,590
Look!

2023
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,170
I got 50 Monkey Money!

2024
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,090
Alright...

2025
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,630
I'll use the Ice thing later!

2026
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,670
Firebomb!

2027
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:51,970
Firebomb!

2028
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:52,070
Look at that!

2029
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:55,550
I'm ready for another Firebomb!

2030
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:56,850
Did someone say Firebomb?!

2031
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:58,630
Firebomb!

2032
01:12:59,050 --> 01:12:59,850
Firebomb!

2033
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:02,390
Firebomb!

2034
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,050
That's right!

2035
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:08,350
Oh...

2036
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,730
Fire Firebomb!

2037
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:09,810
Um.

2038
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,490
There we go.

2039
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,530
I got more in me.

2040
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:18,930
I got more fire bombs in me!

2041
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:19,890
Oh shit.

2042
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:20,310
Okay.

2043
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,070
Alright, that's fine.

2044
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:24,650
That was a little scary, but it's fine.

2045
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,810
It's fine.

2046
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,370
It got a little scary there.

2047
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:29,430
Oh shit.

2048
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:31,250
Alright, there we go, its okay.

2049
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,370
Look at that.

2050
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,950
Look at that.

2051
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:34,970
I got rid of them.

2052
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:38,050
I got more fire bombs in me.

2053
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,130
OH MY GOD.

2054
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,330
Okay, okay.

2055
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:45,690
I didn't expect a second balloon to hit, but it's okay.

2056
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,010
Oh my god.

2057
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:50,810
Firebomb!

2058
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,530
There you go.

2059
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,330
There you go.

2060
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,150
I have more abilities.

2061
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,710
I have more abilities.

2062
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,090
Changing target can sometimes help.

2063
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,290
Wait, I can do that?

2064
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:01,110
I can do that?

2065
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:03,110
How the fuck do I change target?

2066
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:04,670
Firebomb.

2067
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,170
Oh no.

2068
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,450
Oh no.

2069
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:08,970
It's fine.

2070
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,550
They're all broken.

2071
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:11,990
Oh.

2072
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:13,470
It's fine.

2073
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:13,790
It's fine.

2074
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:14,850
I still have HP.

2075
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,650
Wait, Tab?

2076
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:19,670
What?

2077
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:23,890
Wait, what?

2078
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,770
Oh my god.

2079
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,490
What?

2080
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,570
What?

2081
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,370
Oh no.

2082
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:31,990
Oh no.

2083
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:32,490
No!

2084
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,140
I'm so close.

2085
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,300
I'm so close.

2086
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,600
I'm so close.

2087
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,540
No!

2088
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,460
I know what I did wrong.

2089
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:12,550
I know exactly what I did wrong.

2090
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:26,910
I need the

2091
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,500
plane though.

2092
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,640
The plane actually helped.

2093
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:33,760
Wait.

2094
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,200
Actually, yeah.

2095
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,180
The plane did shit.

2096
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:39,660
Okay.

2097
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,560
All right.

2098
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:51,860
This is perfect.

2099
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,680
My perfect build.

2100
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,600
My...

2101
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,180
There we go.

2102
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,580
And then...

2103
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:07,120
We'll put glue boy here just in case.

2104
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:12,060
You just do whatever you do, glue boy.

2105
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,060
Do your thing, glue boy.

2106
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:16,360
Do your thing.

2107
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,280
This is fine.

2108
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,580
We figured it out.

2109
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,360
Firebomb.

2110
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:26,240
Oh, so like...

2111
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,180
How do I move this?

2112
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,440
How do I move it though?

2113
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,420
Oh, I got Druid Alchemist.

2114
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,660
Wait, how do I move the thing?

2115
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:39,700
Oh.

2116
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:40,720
Wait.

2117
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:41,780
I don't understand.

2118
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:43,980
Sorry.

2119
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,360
How safe it is.

2120
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:46,820
Thank you.

2121
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:47,920
Oh, is it this?

2122
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,460
Oh.

2123
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:52,580
I'll put it here.

2124
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:53,740
Okay.

2125
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,620
Don't worry.

2126
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,920
Five bombs right...

2127
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,900
Or maybe I'll put...

2128
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,360
I like this target right here.

2129
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,140
I feel like this part actually was good.

2130
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,480
Don't worry.

2131
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,520
He knows what's up.

2132
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,740
Put it in the crossroads?

2133
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:12,360
Like here?

2134
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,720
Oh, I see.

2135
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,420
Here.

2136
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,380
Oh, that's smart actually.

2137
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:18,800
Firebomb!

2138
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,360
You know what?

2139
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:21,840
Fuck it.

2140
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:22,780
Let's freeze everything.

2141
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,120
Just for the fun of it.

2142
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,140
Watch this.

2143
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,120
Fire...

2144
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,100
Firebomb!

2145
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,000
Look at him go.

2146
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,860
I can do more.

2147
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,080
You know what?

2148
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:37,940
This is easier now.

2149
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,840
I literally have...

2150
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,840
So many ice monkeys for this.

2151
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:43,600
Firebomb!

2152
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:45,300
Alright.

2153
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,040
I'm keeping this for the Morba.

2154
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:47,880
Or Moba.

2155
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:49,760
Alright.

2156
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,380
This is it.

2157
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,080
I believe.

2158
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,940
There you go.

2159
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:56,760
There you go.

2160
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:57,840
Okay.

2161
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
He should be dead here.

2162
01:17:59,160 --> 01:17:59,400
Yes.

2163
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,300
Nice.

2164
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:02,780
Okay.

2165
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:03,700
How...

2166
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,260
Guys.

2167
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:05,580
Um...

2168
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,260
I don't understand.

2169
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:16,380
Is Ice Monkey not a viable strat?

2170
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,260
I don't...

2171
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,040
I don't understand.

2172
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,140
What could I be doing wrong?

2173
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:42,880
I don't...

2174
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,560
What could I possibly be doing wrong?

2175
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,720
Ah, I guess I'll never...

2176
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,340
It's okay.

2177
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,880
I have Ice Monkey.

2178
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,980
I don't understand what I could be doing wrong.

2179
01:18:59,320 --> 01:18:59,880
Wait.

2180
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,340
I think I might lose this already.

2181
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,560
Okay.

2182
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,240
I realized I shouldn't put Ice Monkey first.

2183
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:09,880
Okay.

2184
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:10,800
Let me put...

2185
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,400
Okay.

2186
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,440
Let me put DPS in.

2187
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,060
And then...

2188
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,940
We know...

2189
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,820
Doki.

2190
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,360
Sorry.

2191
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,640
That was my bad.

2192
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,280
I should not have put Ice Monkey first.

2193
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,760
I didn't realize I don't have enough money.

2194
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,360
Okay.

2195
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,340
There we go.

2196
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,780
Now this should be easier now.

2197
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,580
Now it should be a little easier.

2198
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,880
We'll do...

2199
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,340
Improve...

2200
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,560
Actually, I want to improve range.

2201
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,680
The problem is that you need more Ice.

2202
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,360
You're right.

2203
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,720
I have enough DPS now.

2204
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,160
This should be easier.

2205
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,280
I have enough DPS.

2206
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,080
Okay.

2207
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:04,600
I just need like 500 dollars so I could put five Ice Monkey in here.

2208
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,540
Alright.

2209
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,900
Don't worry.

2210
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,200
Your hero is here.

2211
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,820
Your hero is here.

2212
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,260
Ice Monkey!

2213
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,700
Alright.

2214
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:47,630
I'm gonna save up more for Hot Range.

2215
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:49,370
What's this?

2216
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,930
Is this Hot Range?

2217
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:51,310
Okay.

2218
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:51,670
Okay.

2219
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:51,710
Okay.

2220
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,150
Alright.

2221
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:55,190
Hot Range.

2222
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,280
Does he have enough now?

2223
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,340
Oh, he does.

2224
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,100
Okay.

2225
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,780
And then I gotta save up for more Ice Monkey.

2226
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:12,430
Don't worry.

2227
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,130
I'm almost there.

2228
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,730
The hero is coming in.

2229
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,510
Don't worry.

2230
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,470
Just need a couple of more dollars.

2231
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,330
The hero is here.

2232
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,570
Ice Monkey!

2233
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,110
That's right, everybody.

2234
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:33,770
Cheer for Ice Monkey!

2235
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:34,370
Woo!

2236
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,210
Ice Monkey!

2237
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,450
Ice Monkey!

2238
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:43,070
Ice Monkey!

2239
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:44,650
Ice Monkey!

2240
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:44,830
Ice Monkey!

2241
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:45,730
Okay.

2242
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,830
I feel like...

2243
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:52,210
Definitely need longer range and more tacks.

2244
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:54,650
And then upgrade...

2245
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:57,710
Uh...

2246
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:58,370
We'll do this.

2247
01:21:59,370 --> 01:21:59,790
Alright.

2248
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,070
And then...

2249
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:04,450
Ice Monkey!

2250
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:05,250
Oh!

2251
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:06,330
Ice Monkey!

2252
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:07,750
Ice Monkey!

2253
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:08,850
Ice Monkey!

2254
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,610
Our hero!

2255
01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:12,810
The hero!

2256
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,770
The hero we all deserve!

2257
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:16,990
Ice monkey!

2258
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:22,790
Okay, I feel like I should definitely add another one here.

2259
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:26,310
Alright.

2260
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,530
A people's monkey!

2261
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:36,570
Oh, it can... Oh, wait, really?

2262
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:38,670
I did not know that.

2263
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:39,070
Whoops.

2264
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:40,890
It's fine.

2265
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:41,870
We have...

2266
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,930
We'll save up for helicopter monkey.

2267
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:48,030
I haven't done anything with helicopter monkey before.

2268
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,740
Alright, let's see.

2269
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,600
You know what?

2270
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,740
Let's do refreeze.

2271
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,440
And then cold snap.

2272
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:00,220
There we go.

2273
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,040
Alright, I should save up for this.

2274
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,600
I keep forgetting to save up for it.

2275
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,630
We need helicopter monkey!

2276
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:10,850

2284
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:24,830
Alright.

01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:29,070
Okay, I need Quad and... Quad and what?

2286
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,070
What's my second upgrade?

Top path?

2288
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:32,890
Top two?

2289
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:34,130
Alright.

Alright, here we go.

01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,470
Wait, I control him?

2294
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,070
Oh, I didn't realize.

2295
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:51,370
Oh, I didn't realize.

2296
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:52,670
I control the helicopter?

2297
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,530
Wait, how do I not control you?

2298
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,350
Do your own thing!

2299
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:00,610
I... Do your own thing!

2300
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:04,950
I don't... Oh, it auto moves.

2301
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,850
Okay, okay.

2302
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:07,730
I have to control them.

2303
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:08,390
For now.

2304
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:08,850
Okay.

2305
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:10,670
Okay, that's good to know.

2306
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:14,830
I was like... I was like, I don't want to be in charge of you!

2307
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:16,670
You're your own person!

2308
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:18,330
Alright.

2309
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:18,690
Alright.

2310
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:19,010
That's fine.

2311
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:21,010
That's fine.

2312
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:22,630
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

2313
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,350
Shoot him!

2314
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:24,690
Oh, no.

2315
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,230
Oh, no.

2316
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:27,930
Oh, no.

2317
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:28,310
Okay.

2318
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:29,450
That's fine.

2319
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:30,550
Nice.

2320
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:30,850
Okay.

2321
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,650
Oh, fuck.

2322
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:31,950
Oh.

2323
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:35,270
No, I almost spent my... I almost bought that!

2324
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,150
Okay, there we go.

2325
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:38,230
There we go.

2326
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:39,270
Now I don't have to worry.

2327
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:40,930
Alright.

2328
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:43,390
Here we go.

2329
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:44,830
Things are fine now.

2330
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:45,830
Everything is okay.

2331
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:49,670
Now I can spend more money on what truly matters in life.

2332
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:53,570
And then... Let's do it here.

2333
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:55,390
Alright.

2334
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:59,230
Uh... Yes.

2335
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,030
Be able to shoot that.

2336
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,050
Go, sniper monkey!

2337
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:07,770
Let's go!

2338
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,680
You know what this world needs?

2339
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,380
More eyes.

2340
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,340
Yes.

2341
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:22,380
Yes.

2342
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,040
More eyes!

2343
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,300
Yay, level up!

2344
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,360
I got a new hero!

2345
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,940
Wait, did I finish it?

2346
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:30,340
Oh, wait.

2347
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:30,500
No.

2348
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,160
There's still 60.

2349
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:31,660
Alright.

2350
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,460
I was like, yippee!

2351
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,380
I did it!

2352
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,020
60 more to go.

2353
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,040
Okay.

2354
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:38,740
Okay.

2355
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:42,660
Go clap.

2356
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:43,920
Keep clapping.

2357
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,270
Keep clapping.

2358
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:49,730
Keep clapping.

2359
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:49,730
Keep clapping.

2360
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:49,730
Okay.

2361
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:49,990
Nice.

2362
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,010
I can keep upgrading.

2363
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,530
Uh... Upgrade.

2364
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,110
Bless me.

2365
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:01,850
Alright.

2366
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:02,190
Nice.

2367
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:03,030
Oh, shit.

2368
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,530
Oh, fuck!

2369
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:07,430
I... That's awkward.

2370
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:07,910
It's fine.

2371
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:10,550
I did a little too early, but that's okay.

2372
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,730
It still worked.

2373
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:14,070
It still worked, guys.

2374
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:16,090
It still worked, guys.

2375
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:18,050
I might have done it a little early, but it's still okay.

2376
01:26:18,930 --> 01:26:19,210
Okay.

2377
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,530
Nice.

2378
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,370
More ice.

2379
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:21,950
Freeze.

2380
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:22,350
Ice.

2381
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:22,590
Ice.

2382
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:22,950
Ice, baby.

2383
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:23,930
Alright.

2384
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,510
And then... Almost have enough for more.

2385
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:28,830
Nice.

2386
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:30,930
Keep clapping!

2387
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,510
Clap!

2388
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,890
Clap my monkeys!

2389
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:37,010
Clap my monkeys!

2390
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,010
Yes!

2391
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,750
I love my clapping monkeys.

2392
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:48,110
I love my clapping monkeys.

2393
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:48,110
Alright.

2394
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:50,430
He big boy now.

2395
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,090
Oh, my God!

2396
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,310
You're big boy!

2397
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:55,710
28,000?

2398
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:56,730
Jesus Christ!

2399
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:58,410
I do not have that money.

2400
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:06,330
I should upgrade- I should really upgrade my other monkeys, I- Alright, 2,000.

2401
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:08,450
Okay, we'll do with you first.

2402
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,370
Alright.

2403
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:14,230
We'll do with both of you first.

2404
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:17,290
I should really- Okay, nice.

2405
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:19,630
Alright.

2406
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:23,790
Gotta get those- Gotta get those firemouth.

2407
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,930
2,200?

2408
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:28,970
That's fine.

2409
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:30,190
I just need to get there.

2410
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:32,290
Alright, my ice monkeys are all fully leveled up.

2411
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:34,410
I guess I can upgrade my other stuff now.

2412
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:37,310
Um, I guess they matter too.

2413
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:39,290
Oh, what's this?

2414
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,670
Support monkeys.

2415
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:44,050
And to gain money, spend on more stuff.

2416
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,250
Monkey village?

2417
01:27:46,450 --> 01:27:53,510
Use range by- Holds a trusty nail gun that Pop can upgrade to create its own nail shooting- What do I get?

2418
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:54,850
Banana farm?

2419
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:57,510
Banana farm?

2420
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:57,930
Banana farm?

2421
01:27:57,930 --> 01:27:59,370
What do I do with banana farm?

2422
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,290
Monkey farm time.

2423
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:07,450
Cash by tapping.

2424
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,030
Don't wait too long to boil it.

2425
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,250
How do I tap the banana?

2426
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:13,390
Where is the banana?

2427
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,150
Where is it?

2428
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,390
Where the fuck is the banana?

2429
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:20,070
Oh, there it is.

2430
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,470
Oh!

2431
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:21,330
Oh, shit!

2432
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:22,270
I got distracted!

2433
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,430
I was trying to figure out how to tap the banana!

2434
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,330
Okay, this is illegal.

2435
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:32,090
I was trying to tap the banana there.

2436
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:34,670
Okay.

2437
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:37,530
Let's see.

2438
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:40,290
I just wanted to tap the banana!

2439
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,190
Oh, wait!

2440
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:46,160
Oh, my monkeys are- Oh!

2441
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,820
They tap it for me!

2442
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,720
Wait, I think I got the strat.

2443
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:50,800
What is that?

2444
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:55,060
Or is it my ha- Oh, it's me.

2445
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:56,500
I'm just tapping it myself.

2446
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:57,920
Oh, haha, okay.

2447
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,360
It's okay.

2448
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,320
Everything is okay.

2449
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,500
Everything is okay right now.

2450
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:07,280
Oh, my god.

2451
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,180
Everything is so fast right now, too.

2452
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,760
Oh, my god.

2453
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:11,120
Okay.

2454
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:12,420
Nice.

2455
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,540
Should be able to afford that.

2456
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,780
What next?

2457
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:16,980
I'm so strong!

2458
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,420
I'm so strong now.

2459
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,220
Look at him go!

2460
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:26,660
Look at me go!

2461
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,020
I don't even have to worry about anything!

2462
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:32,920
Alright, what do I get next?

2463
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,780
Spike Factory?

2464
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,260
There's a- Oh, I should get that.

2465
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,140
Put it here.

2466
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:42,640
Put it here.

2467
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:42,940
There we go.

2468
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,380
More farm- Set to strong- More farms be there!

2469
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,840
Why do I do this?

2470
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,440
Increase production.

2471
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,400
Easy collect.

2472
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,900
Oh, I'll do- More- More bananas.

2473
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,280
More bananas.

2474
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,060
More farms.

2475
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:04,640
Base.

2476
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,840
It is so easy.

2477
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,220
This is actually such an easy game.

2478
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,180
I figured out the meta.

2479
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,620
I just need three ice monkeys, and a helicopter.

2480
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:17,560
What the fuck is that?

2481
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,280
Oops, sorry.

2482
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:22,440
I used- It's fine.

2483
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,160
Don't have to worry about it.

2484
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,100
I still won.

2485
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:26,880
Yay!

2486
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,000
What did I get?

2487
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:34,680
Nice.

2488
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:35,360
I got money.

2489
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,460
Oh, hey!

2490
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,340
He's new!

2491
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,380
Who's he?

2492
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,560
I've never seen him before!

2493
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,440
Wrong placement.

2494
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:47,560
I don't know!

2495
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:51,660
My chat has been very helpful and very nice to me.

2496
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,100
They like the Ice Monkey meta.

2497
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,980
I created a new meta.

2498
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,580
What's this?

2499
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,280
Where's the- Where's the boss fight?

2500
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,900
I think I can deal with the boss fight.

2501
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:04,920
What?

2502
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,000
Daily challenge?

2503
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,160
Is this the boss fight?

2504
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,580
Are these the boss fight?

2505
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:25,570
Bottom path is ice only.

2506
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:27,030
Click the two monkeys.

2507
01:31:27,170 --> 01:31:27,370
Him?

2508
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:32,970
You're not ready?

2509
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,610
Don't tell me what to do!

2510
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:35,550
I'm always ready!

2511
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:40,690
I'm ready!

2512
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:42,250
I know when I'm ready!

2513
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:45,470
Whoa!

2514
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:47,230
Guys, I might not be ready.

2515
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:53,030
Whoa!

2516
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:55,310
Wait, this guy's a little freaky!

2517
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:03,130
Boss appears in 39 rounds, and you know what I- Oh, shit.

2518
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:04,170
Wait, I already fucked up.

2519
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:07,170
Okay.

2520
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:08,710
Alright, there we go.

2521
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:11,750
Now, it should be okay.

2522
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:12,410
Uh.

2523
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:12,970
Uh.

2524
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,750
GG.

2525
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:17,030
I'm sorry.

2526
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:22,070
It was like my first instinct to go- To do Ice Monkey.

2527
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:24,670
It was just like a first instinct thing.

2528
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:25,030
Okay.

2529
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:27,090
You're not SpongeBob.

2530
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:28,550
You aren't ready.

2531
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:31,030
Penguin, thank you for the super chat.

2532
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:31,990
Thank you, thank you.

2533
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,090
Damn.

2534
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:35,450
That's fine.

2535
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:36,210
Now I'm ready.

2536
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,170
Now I'm actually ready.

2537
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:39,070
Now...

2538
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,910
I should be okay.

2539
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:47,250
Damn.

2540
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,750
Alright, and then I should save up for this.

2541
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:55,510
Should be fine.

2542
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,630
No, I'm not cooked already.

2543
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:00,610
I just started.

2544
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:03,610
How could I fuck up already?

2545
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:04,140
I literally...

2546
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:05,260
I literally...

2547
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:05,990
I literally...

2548
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:07,190
Just started with me rounds...

2549
01:33:07,190 --> 01:33:08,350
How am I supposed to afford it?

2550
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:08,890
It's five!

2551
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,810
It's a thousand dollars!

2552
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,850
I... I'm broke!

2553
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:17,370
Now I just wait for my trump card.

2554
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:22,070
I just got... I'm patient.

2555
01:33:22,910 --> 01:33:25,590
Now I just gotta wait for Ice Monkey.

2556
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:27,910
Ice Monkey!

2557
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:30,690
Hehehehe.

2558
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,630
There you go.

2559
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:33,130
Now it's winnable.

2560
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,270
Now it's winnable, guys.

2561
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:41,810
Alright.

2562
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,170
The hero has arrived.

2563
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:44,230
The people's hero.

2564
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:46,970
Alright.

2565
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:48,770
Don't worry.

2566
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:50,430
Now save up for the farm.

2567
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:51,450
It can't be that bad.

2568
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,230
He won't lose.

2569
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:55,790
No, I won't!

2570
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:57,570
He's the people's hero!

2571
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:00,010
He's a... he's a hero!

2572
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:03,190
How could I lose with a hero by my side?

2573
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:06,490
Look!

2574
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:08,250
I'm already halfway to a farm!

2575
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,170
Look at that!

2576
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:16,690
Okay, this is a little bad.

2577
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:21,070
Yo, I'll put this here just in case.

2578
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:21,910
I... I don't know.

2579
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:23,310
I feel a little...

2580
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,770
I feel a little bad here.

2581
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:28,290
Okay.

2582
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:29,410
Now I should have enough.

2583
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:33,330
Alright.

2584
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,390
Can you skill?

2585
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:39,390
Thank you for the super chat.

2586
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,290
Thank you, thank you.

2587
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:41,650
Oh, wait.

2588
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:42,930
Wait a minute.

2589
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:43,630
Oh, shit.

2590
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,370
I did that out of panic.

2591
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:47,650
Because...

2592
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,010
That was out of panic, guys.

2593
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,030
Because I got a little worried.

2594
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,890
I got a little worried there.

2595
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:57,750
But it's okay.

2596
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,710
I almost have a farm.

2597
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:59,850
I almost have a farm.

2598
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:01,370
And then I can have multiple...

2599
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:03,030
uh...

2600
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:04,150
See?

2601
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:05,490
Look, it's fine.

2602
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:06,130
It's fine.

2603
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:07,750
Everything is fine.

2604
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:08,690
Now I have...

2605
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:10,130
Now I have my farm.

2606
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,990
It's okay.

2607
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,590
And then I can have multiple ice monkeys.

2608
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:14,230
It's okay.

2609
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:16,070
Alright, nice.

2610
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:16,310
See?

2611
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:16,610
Look.

2612
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:19,130
And then I can have multiple ice monkeys.

2613
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,770
It's okay.

2614
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:20,510
See?

2615
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:22,250
Things are gonna be...

2616
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,190
Okay.

2617
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:28,440
Thanks will be okay.

2618
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:38,220
Okay, and then all I need is... oh my god, all I need is more here.

2619
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:43,680
Uh, things... things will be... okay.

2620
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:48,660
Alright.

2621
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,020
I just realized we have nothing that can kill that.

2622
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,520
Okay, things...

2623
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:57,660
It's okay, I have my farm.

2624
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,240
It's fine.

2625
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,580
We have sniper monkey.

2626
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:04,080
We have sniper monkey, guys.

2627
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,140
There we go.

2628
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,060
See?

2629
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,420
Nothing to worry about.

2630
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,180
Nothing to worry about.

2631
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:16,900
Look, we have stronger ice monkey now.

2632
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:20,340
Look at that.

2633
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,460
Strong ice monkey, look at that.

2634
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2635
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:26,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2636
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,420
Calm down.

2637
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,120
Calm down.

2638
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,200
Alright.

2639
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,060
Look at them go.

2640
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:38,840
Look at them go.

2641
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:39,580
Look at them.

2642
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,160
Whoa, look at them go.

2643
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:41,620
See?

2644
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,660
Look at them go.

2645
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,180
Oh, the boss appears in 10 rounds.

2646
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,800
This is getting a little worse.

2647
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,760
But it's okay.

2648
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,340
Just keep believing.

2649
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,360
Oh, my God.

2650
01:36:58,600 --> 01:36:59,300
Oh, wait.

2651
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:02,480
It's okay.

2652
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,100
It's all right.

2653
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:08,500
It's okay.

2654
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,060
Firebomb.

2655
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:11,700
It's okay.

2656
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,180
Firebomb.

2657
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:19,300
See?

2658
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,920
Nothing to worry about.

2659
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,840
Oh, the fear.

2660
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,780
I just need a helicopter.

2661
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:28,940
I just need a helicopter.

2662
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,240
The things will be okay.

2663
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,560
The moment I get a helicopter, things will be okay.

2664
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:36,780
Guys, things will be okay.

2665
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:38,240
Helicopter.

2666
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,940
Oh, my God.

2667
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:40,240
Okay.

2668
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,740
Helicopter.

2669
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:42,900
Helicopter.

2670
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:43,360
Okay.

2671
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:44,760
Firebomb.

2672
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,200
There we go.

2673
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,100
$500.

2674
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,060
$500 is fast.

2675
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:50,560
We get $500.

2676
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,880
Okay, there we go.

2677
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,440
See, nothing to worry about.

2678
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,620
Nothing to worry about.

2679
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,760
Why were you all so scared?

2680
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,000
Why were you all so scared?

2681
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,180
I wasn't scared.

2682
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,940
I wasn't scared at all.

2683
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,140
I was not scared at all.

2684
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,480
I knew what I was doing.

2685
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,000
I knew exactly what I was doing.

2686
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,100
Alright, I need... what was it?

2687
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:17,900
The tactic.

2688
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,720
Okay, a thousand dollars.

2689
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:21,640
We can afford that.

2690
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,100
Okay, here we go.

2691
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:25,580
There we go!

2692
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,320
What do I not know?

2693
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,320
What do I... what do I... what could I possibly not know?

2694
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:34,040
What could it be?

2695
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,300
Alright.

2696
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,800
Everything seems okay so far.

2697
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,580
Nothing much to worry about.

2698
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,020
Oh!

2699
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:48,840
Oh!

2700
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,340
Oh!

2701
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,520
Oh!

2702
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:53,740
Oh!

2703
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:54,280
Oh!

2704
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,200
Oh, what is that?

2705
01:38:58,960 --> 01:38:59,680
Oh!

2706
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,480
Uh...

2707
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:05,180
What is that?

2708
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,140
What am I looking at?

2709
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,080
What...

2710
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,320
What...

2711
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:12,800
What can I...

2712
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,280
What am I looking at?

2713
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,200
What do you mean?

2714
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,100
Where's Super Monkey?

2715
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:20,220
I thought...

2716
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,080
Oh, it's 2,500.

2717
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:23,760
Oh, wait.

2718
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,580
Super Monkey, it is your time to shine.

2719
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,720
It is your time.

2720
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,880
Guys, what do I get for Super Monkey?

2721
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,380
What does he need?

2722
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,100
What does he need?

2723
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,600
Guys, what does he need?

2724
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:41,410
It's okay.

2725
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:42,490
It's okay.

2726
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:43,230
I have a play.

2727
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:44,550
Go in there!

2728
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:46,570
Do your thing!

2729
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:50,230
Oh my God, he needs rage, but he's so weak.

2730
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:52,650
He needs rage, but he's so weak.

2731
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:57,250
Oh my God, why is your XP so low?

2732
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,570
Game over?!

2733
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,510
Where did...

2734
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:03,390
Where was he going?!

2735
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,750
Alright.

2736
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,730
Guys, I might not be ready for boss fight.

2737
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:16,010
Let's go back to baby level.

2738
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:19,350
We'll go back to...

2739
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:21,730
The comfort of Monkey Meadows.

2740
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,690
Wait, where's my ice monkey?

2741
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:26,150
What?

2742
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:29,770
How do you win without...

2743
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:30,770
Ice Monkey?

2744
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:35,330
How do you do that?

2745
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:38,390
There's...

2746
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,730
There's...

2747
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:40,770
You can win without Ice Monkey?

2748
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:42,810
That's a thing?

2749
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,490
Ice Monkey is military too!

2750
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:50,330
He...

2751
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:51,590
He enlisted!

2752
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:57,030
He also enlisted!

2753
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:57,250
He also enlisted!

2754
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,750
Okay, how the fuck...

2755
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:04,690
Okay, that's just like...

2756
01:41:06,830 --> 01:41:07,750
Like...

2757
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:08,230
How?

2758
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,670
How the fuck do I...

2759
01:41:13,670 --> 01:41:14,330
What?

2760
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:19,390
I guess faster firing...

2761
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:20,270
I guess faster firing...

2762
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:23,270
Even then, I can't even fucking afford it.

2763
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:29,570
Oh, I need to attack speed first?

2764
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:30,850
Whoops.

2765
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:32,810
Whoops.

2766
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:36,670
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

2767
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:37,850
Okay, it's fine.

2768
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:39,090
Now I know.

2769
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:40,730
Now I know.

2770
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,010
Now I can upgrade you.

2771
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:47,980
All right.

2772
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:49,600
There we go.

2773
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,480
And then I'll save up for the hero.

2774
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:56,440
Wait, it's a lot easier now.

2775
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:03,150
Blunarism later.

2776
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,270
And then thank you for the super chat.

2777
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:05,770
Thank you.

2778
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:06,490
Thank you.

2779
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:12,150
It can't get that bad now.

2780
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,090
I just gotta wait.

2781
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,510
I'm patient enough.

2782
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,190
I can wait.

2783
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,580
I miss Ice Monkey.

2784
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:27,740
Wait, maybe...

2785
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,220
Maybe I do.

2786
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:30,940
I can't wait.

2787
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,500
Sorry, guys.

2788
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,820
Apparently, I can't actually wait.

2789
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:41,100
Now, now I can wait, guys.

2790
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:42,200
Now I can wait.

2791
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,480
I'm patient now.

2792
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,220
I swear to God.

2793
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:54,440
I can wait this time.

2794
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,740
Oh, my God.

2795
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,420
Okay, this is a little...

2796
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,320
Okay, no, we're fine.

2797
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,060
Okay, there you go.

2798
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:02,600
There you go.

2799
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:03,680
Things are okay now.

2800
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:07,000
I can wait this time.

2801
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:08,980
Can I need 350?

2802
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:10,860
And then I'll put in...

2803
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:13,260
I'll do another upgrade for that.

2804
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:15,280
I need to get another...

2805
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,000
Sniper Monkey to focus on this upgrade.

2806
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,000
There you go.

2807
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,220
Just in case.

2808
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,960
And then...

2809
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:28,260
Uh...

2810
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,480
And I'll wait for...

2811
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:31,620
I'll get another Sniper Monkey.

2812
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:36,020
Should be fine.

2813
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:36,580
Should be fine.

2814
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:37,540
Nice.

2815
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,480
Okay, and then I'll focus on upgrading.

2816
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,660
I'll get another...

2817
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,240
Okay, I think it's fine, right?

2818
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:46,620
Fire Bomb.

2819
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,620
Okay, let's put it here.

2820
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:49,560
Yeah, see?

2821
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:50,080
I'm learning.

2822
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:52,200
I'm learning, guys.

2823
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,100
You can't teach me new tricks.

2824
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,720
And then I'll do...

2825
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,200
Night Goggles.

2826
01:43:59,460 --> 01:43:59,480
Night Goggles.

2827
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:01,720
Look at that!

2828
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,640
This is all snipers.

2829
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,520
Okay, I should save up for the helicopter, though.

2830
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,120
I'm gonna save up for a helicopter.

2831
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,600
I can read!

2832
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,340
Okay, maybe...

2833
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,400
Pass through for...

2834
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:17,590
Hmm...

2835
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,800
No, I should save up.

2836
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,040
I should save up for a helicopter.

2837
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,500
Fire Bomb!

2838
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:25,440
Look at that!

2839
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,940
Let me go!

2840
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:30,320
Play on the hardest level!

2841
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:32,580
On the hardest map!

2842
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,820
I'm so good, guys.

2843
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:38,880
Pew, pew!

2844
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:40,880
Alright.

2845
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:42,380
Stay here.

2846
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:45,880
Wait.

2847
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:46,740
Fire Bomb!

2848
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:47,320
Wait.

2849
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:48,100
Fire Bomb!

2850
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:51,680
Okay, that should be enough, right?

2851
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,840
Okay, I need 500 now.

2852
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,120
Wait, 60 rounds?!

2853
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:00,680
I still have 60 rounds?!

2854
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,460
Jesus Christ.

2855
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,380
Alright, now I don't have to care about them.

2856
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,440
Okay, and then...

2857
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,300
Bigger jets.

2858
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,700
So you can get the camo.

2859
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:09,280
And...

2860
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,220
I should actually save up for the mortar.

2861
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,220
And then camo.

2862
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,200
And then now I'll save up, guys.

2863
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:17,260
Okay, wait.

2864
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:17,960
After I get this.

2865
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:18,680
Now!

2866
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,520
Now I'll save up.

2867
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:22,640
Okay, after I get this, though.

2868
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:23,340
This is important.

2869
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:24,540
Okay, now...

2870
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:25,060
Now I can...

2871
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:25,720
I'll save up.

2872
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,220
Alright, Engineer Monkey.

2873
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,900
Well, I can't do anything with him, though.

2874
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:31,920
Alright, now I'll save my money.

2875
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:32,780
For real.

2876
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:34,420
Well...

2877
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:35,660
Alright.

2878
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,040
I couldn't help it!

2879
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,280
There are so many options!

2880
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,980
What do I get for him?

2881
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:44,740
Bigger blast.

2882
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:45,920
Which is good, guys.

2883
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:54,400
Bigger blast.

2884
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,500
Faster reload.

2885
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:58,840
Reload?

2886
01:45:59,020 --> 01:45:59,380
Alright.

2887
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:01,640
I'll do reload and I'll do bigger blast.

2888
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,300
Attack speed.

2889
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:05,640
There's attack speed?

2890
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,300
The biggest... this one?

2891
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:11,940
Faster reload?

2892
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:15,040
Bigger blaster.

2893
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:16,520
Increase accuracy.

2894
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:17,940
More ice.

2895
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:21,180
Guys, if I could, my entire area would be ice monkey.

2896
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,240
If I could.

2897
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:33,120
Okay, but like, do I have to be accurate or could I just... You know what?

2898
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:35,240
Top is worse path.

2899
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:36,340
Top, bigger blast.

2900
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,200
You know what?

2901
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,840
Bigger means... means like it'll hit more.

2902
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,240
That's how I like to go at it.

2903
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:49,620
Alright, and then we'll... Let's level up this.

2904
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,120
Yeah, we don't need accuracy as long as it hits.

2905
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,840
We just need things to go kaboom.

2906
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,020
Boom.

2907
01:46:59,380 --> 01:46:59,860
Boom.

2908
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:00,480
Boom.

2909
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,140
There you go.

2910
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,220
As long as things go kaboom, things will be fine.

2911
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,720
Fire bomb.

2912
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,200
Alright.

2913
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:12,620
I'm gonna wait for a bouncing bullet next.

2914
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,600
I don't think we need... Oh wait, what if we have two helicopters?

2915
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,480
Oh my god.

2916
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,600
Two helicopters, double the fun.

2917
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,740
And then the two helicopters can get to know each other and make babies.

2918
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,320
And then we'll have baby helicopters.

2919
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,500
Oh, I should not have upgraded that.

2920
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:34,060
I should have tried the bottom path.

2921
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,220
Toki?

2922
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,120
What?

2923
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,960
Then we'll have baby helicopters.

2924
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:44,640
That's how baby helicopters are... That's how drones are born.

2925
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:50,300
And then when the mommy helicopter and the daddy helicopter loves each other very much, we get drones.

2926
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:54,620
Don't eat.

2927
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:57,160
What?

2928
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,660
Is that how drones are born?

2929
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:04,340
Insane.

2930
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,920
That's how...

2931
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,680
That's the miracle of drone birth.

2932
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:16,220
Let's just have more helicopters.

2933
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,040
Just have everything.

2934
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:19,140
It's just helicopters.

2935
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,180
No, I can't...

2936
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:22,240
I can't...

2937
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,460
Okay, we'll redo the...

2938
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:27,380
Okay, this time I will use the correct path.

2939
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:28,740
Alright, there we go.

2940
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,480
I keep fucking up.

2941
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,660
I keep fucking this up.

2942
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:33,220
Okay, there we go.

2943
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,420
This is what I wanted to do.

2944
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:35,580
There we go.

2945
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:36,720
Now...

2946
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,520
Now we have a whole family.

2947
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:41,740
Alright.

2948
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,820
Wait, doesn't this give me...

2949
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:45,120
Okay.

2950
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:49,100
Cause it...

2951
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,040
Oh my god, there it goes!

2952
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:50,400
See?

2953
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,580
There's a drone!

2954
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:52,500
I knew it!

2955
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,860
I knew it!

2956
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:59,060
When a mommy and daddy helicopter loves each other very much, we get drones!

2957
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:00,720
I fucking knew it!

2958
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:04,880
I knew it existed.

2959
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,580
I'm saving up for that.

2960
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,280
It's true.

2961
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,940
I knew it was real.

2962
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,440
You guys laughed.

2963
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,620
But I knew it was real.

2964
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,360
It's true.

2965
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,020
It's true.

2966
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,180
Alright.

2967
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:21,160
I'm saving up for the babies.

2968
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:23,940
This is much more important.

2969
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,000
Alright.

2970
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:28,260
There is...

2971
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,360
Alright.

2972
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,860
We're almost there.

2973
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:32,740
We're halfway.

2974
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,220
We're halfway to the baby.

2975
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:38,980
I can't believe this.

2976
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:39,900
I told you!

2977
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,440
I told you!

2978
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,780
That's how we get drones!

2979
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:44,140
They fell in love!

2980
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,280
Oh my god.

2981
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:47,600
It happened so fast.

2982
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:48,860
We're so close.

2983
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:50,700
We're so close to the baby.

2984
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:54,880
Fire bomb.

2985
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,160
Okay.

2986
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:56,440
I might have used that a little too early.

2987
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:56,680
Okay.

2988
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,080
There we go.

2989
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:58,480
Baby time!

2990
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:00,960
Yay!

2991
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,320
Oh my god.

2992
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:04,220
It's happening so fast that like...

2993
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:06,220
They don't even know what's going on.

2994
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,220
Anymore.

2995
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,780
I have enough for...

2996
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,660
For this.

2997
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,760
I might as well upgrade that.

2998
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:15,580
Since I have money anyway.

2999
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,260
Bro, that ship can't even get over...

3000
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:19,460
Wait.

3001
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:20,160
This is a strat.

3002
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:21,800
Helicopters and ice.

3003
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,820
I figured it out.

3004
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,280
This is a real strat.

3005
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,040
Helicopters and ice.

3006
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,640
I figured it out for real this time.

3007
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:36,960
True.

3008
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:43,120
Alright.

3009
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,060
But if I had ice...

3010
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,480
Then this would have been over like...

3011
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,300
20 years ago.

3012
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:49,200
Nice.

3013
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:51,260
Nice car.

3014
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,440
Steven, thank you for the super chat.

3015
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:54,180
Thank you, thank you.

3016
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:56,020
I can't believe Doki is showing...

3017
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,240
A strong birth live on YouTube.

3018
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:01,080
I can't believe she's getting away with it.

3019
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:03,420
Thank you for the super chat, Steven.

3020
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,500
Thank you, thank you.

3021
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:07,520
Workshop.

3022
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:08,600
Thank you for the super chat.

3023
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:09,340
Thank you, thank you.

3024
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:11,460
This is PSA for how baby drones are made.

3025
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,460
Was brought to you by the US Department of Foreign Policy.

3026
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:20,300
Yay.

3027
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:26,460
We can't even get past who, like...

3028
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,880
Get past the Gwendolyn right now.

3029
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:29,940
Gwendolyn's just chilling.

3030
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,140
Helicopters and ice sounds aggressively Canadian.

3031
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,060
Medium.

3032
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,240
Thank you for the super chat.

3033
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,240
Thank you, thank you.

3034
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:40,380
Yay.

3035
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,340
I've got green foot.

3036
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:46,540
I'm worried that's the last round.

3037
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,520
Okay.

3038
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:52,900
Four helicopters might have been a little overkill.

3039
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:55,760
Boom.

3040
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,460
That's right.

3041
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,000
What you gonna do now?

3042
01:51:59,260 --> 01:51:59,520
Yay.

3043
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:02,980
Easiest paycheck for Gwendolyn.

3044
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:06,180
Gwendolyn won by doing nothing at all.

3045
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:08,560
Nice.

3046
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:09,320
I did it.

3047
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:10,940
What is the harder one?

3048
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:12,600
Apocalypse.

3049
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:14,620
Wait.

3050
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,660
What is apocalypse?

3051
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,760
Ever increasing.

3052
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:19,920
No breaks at the end.

3053
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,140
How far can you get?

3054
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,920
I mean, that was literally how I was playing this game.

3055
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:24,580
Oh, wait.

3056
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:25,800
You mean like right now.

3057
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:26,820
Oh, okay.

3058
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:27,740
Okay.

3059
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:28,340
Um...

3060
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:29,800
I didn't realize you mean...

3061
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,140
Okay, wait.

3062
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:30,640
Actually.

3063
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:31,660
Let me...

3064
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:34,720
Okay.

3065
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:35,380
Okay.

3066
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:38,340
I mean, that was literally what I was doing right now.

3067
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:42,360
I didn't realize it was...

3068
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:45,260
When they meant now, it was like now, now.

3069
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,180
I...

3070
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:46,860
I...

3071
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:50,740
I didn't realize that's what they meant when they said now.

3072
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,280
All right.

3073
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:55,600
But I wanted to do...

3074
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:56,860
Range.

3075
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:57,360
There we go.

3076
01:52:58,720 --> 01:52:59,280
Okay.

3077
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:00,720
And then...

3078
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:00,880
Sure.

3079
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,840
How was I supposed to know it was right now?

3080
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,280
Okay.

3081
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,600
We can save up, right?

3082
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:11,320
For the...

3083
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:11,940
What was it?

3084
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,260
This thing?

3085
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,280
Um...

3086
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:18,800
Here we go.

3087
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,180
And then we'll save up for the...

3088
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:23,500
Aces?

3089
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:25,080
What the fuck are aces?

3090
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,520
I don't even know what...

3091
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,260
They have names?

3092
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:32,920
I know what my strat is.

3093
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,300
Should I get Gwendolyn now?

3094
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:39,040
I should get Gwendolyn now, actually.

3095
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,340
I should get her now, just in case.

3096
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,840
And then I'll save up for this.

3097
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:49,760
Oh my god, you're right.

3098
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:50,840
What am I doing?

3099
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,400
How could I forget the main boy?

3100
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:58,920
How could I do this to him?

3101
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:03,580
Sorry, I was way over my head with all the helicopter babies.

3102
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,680
I will never forget you, Ice Monkey.

3103
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:08,760
Don't worry.

3104
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,680
Don't worry, baby.

3105
01:54:10,860 --> 01:54:11,920
I'll never forget you.

3106
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,220
You were there for me since the very beginning.

3107
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,580
Alright, now we save up for...

3108
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:19,460
Uh, let's put it here.

3109
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:22,600
Now we save up for the banana tree.

3110
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:24,160
Fire bomb!

3111
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:29,790
Alright, nice.

3112
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:33,450
I won't forget you.

3113
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:35,550
Shh.

3114
01:54:35,950 --> 01:54:36,950
Don't let them...

3115
01:54:36,950 --> 01:54:38,930
Don't let them tell lies, baby.

3116
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:40,990
I know I'll never forget you.

3117
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,930
You've been there since the beginning.

3118
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:46,190
They're just telling.

3119
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:47,210
They're just jealous.

3120
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:49,710
They're jealous of what we have.

3121
01:54:52,230 --> 01:54:53,370
Alright, there we go.

3122
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:58,450
Okay, and then we do get helicopter.

3123
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:00,090
We save up for helicopter.

3124
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:02,530
Fire bomb!

3125
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:06,730
Alright, and then...

3126
01:55:06,730 --> 01:55:08,290
We're so close to the helicopter.

3127
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,710
Okay.

3128
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:12,430
Don't...

3129
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:14,470
Don't get tempted to get anything else.

3130
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:16,370
Fire bomb is what it's at.

3131
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,150
Fire bomb!

3132
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:17,910
Oh, shit.

3133
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:19,430
Oh, fuck.

3134
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:22,090
Um...

3135
01:55:22,090 --> 01:55:22,690
Oh, wait.

3136
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:23,870
We have nothing that...

3137
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:25,610
We have...

3138
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:28,370
We have nothing that kills camo.

3139
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:29,710
My bad.

3140
01:55:34,650 --> 01:55:37,470
Everything for the helicopter, though.

3141
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:39,550
Guys, it's all the long game.

3142
01:55:39,670 --> 01:55:40,430
Long game.

3143
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:45,250
I may have forgot about camo stuff.

3144
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:47,390
Whoops!

3145
01:55:48,990 --> 01:55:49,290
Okay.

3146
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:53,250
The moment I get this, I'll focus on camo.

3147
01:55:55,110 --> 01:55:55,610
Come on.

3148
01:55:56,210 --> 01:55:57,930
You know you wanna pop it.

3149
01:55:58,950 --> 01:56:01,210
You know you wanna pop it.

3150
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:02,370
Come on.

3151
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,130
Come on.

3152
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:06,930
Come on.

3153
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:07,350
You know...

3154
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:07,790
There we go.

3155
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:08,830
Alright.

3156
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:09,430
Alright.

3157
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:10,170
There we go.

3158
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:12,930
Now I can do what I've always wanted to do.

3159
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:15,450
Now I can save up for the real deal.

3160
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:17,350
Okay.

3161
01:56:17,350 --> 01:56:18,130
We need a...

3162
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:20,470
Oh.

3163
01:56:22,090 --> 01:56:22,690
Alright.

3164
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:24,090
Uh...

3165
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:24,410
Ooh.

3166
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,670
Fire bomb!

3167
01:56:26,710 --> 01:56:27,310
Okay.

3168
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:29,090
Let's get sniper in here, too.

3169
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,550
Just in case.

3170
01:56:31,070 --> 01:56:32,030
Just in case.

3171
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:32,870
Oh.

3172
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:34,470
We might need sniper buddy here.

3173
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:37,090
Uh...

3174
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:37,750
There we go.

3175
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:38,830
Oh.

3176
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:40,130
Why did I do larger radius?

3177
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:41,010
We don't need that.

3178
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,290
We don't need that.

3179
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:44,170
We don't...

3180
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:44,630
That's fine.

3181
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:45,190
Hey, buddy.

3182
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:46,210
We have fire bomb.

3183
01:56:46,570 --> 01:56:46,850
Haha.

3184
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:48,570
That's fine.

3185
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:50,490
We just need more helicopters.

3186
01:56:52,730 --> 01:56:53,210
Alright.

3187
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:54,150
Nice.

3188
01:56:54,350 --> 01:56:54,470
Okay.

3189
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:57,390
And then we gotta save up for the actual camo stuff.

3190
01:56:57,770 --> 01:56:58,750
What the fuck?

3191
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:00,330
Okay.

3192
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:04,170
We still have only one guy shooting camo, so like, that's not good.

3193
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:04,990
It's okay.

3194
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:05,210
It's okay.

3195
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:06,610
We save up for more helicopters.

3196
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,250
Alright.

3197
01:57:12,410 --> 01:57:13,470
I keep forgetting.

3198
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:14,590
We're saving up for helicopters.

3199
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:15,150
Haha.

3200
01:57:16,530 --> 01:57:16,810
Alright.

3201
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:17,850
It's okay.

3202
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:19,790
Let's try as more helicopters.

3203
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:20,950
It can't go wrong.

3204
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:25,370
More helicopters can never go wrong.

3205
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:28,990
Okay.

3206
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:30,190
We learned that.

3207
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:30,590
Remember.

3208
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:34,030
We just need more helicopters.

3209
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:37,710
We're so close.

3210
01:57:39,730 --> 01:57:41,430
Why did we cover it?

3211
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:42,150
Yes.

3212
01:57:42,150 --> 01:57:42,350
Yes.

3213
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:43,730
We're gonna do that too.

3214
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:44,290
Don't worry.

3215
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:46,650
Alright.

3216
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:47,070
Nice.

3217
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:48,510
Fire bomb.

3218
01:57:50,410 --> 01:57:50,970
Okay.

3219
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:52,970
We need automatic pursuit.

3220
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:53,250
Okay.

3221
01:57:53,290 --> 01:57:53,670
There you go.

3222
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:55,890
And then this one will be...

3223
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:57,690
This one will be babies.

3224
01:57:58,110 --> 01:57:58,530
Don't worry.

3225
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,190
I will never forget the baby strat.

3226
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:01,470
Haha.

3227
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,770
This.

3228
01:58:02,470 --> 01:58:03,310
Don't worry.

3229
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:05,570
A baby strat is here to stay.

3230
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:08,390
Okay.

3231
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:09,690
And then it's monkey time.

3232
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:10,870
And then we upgrade monkey.

3233
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:14,190
Make sure monkey is as strong as it can be.

3234
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:16,450
Alright.

3235
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:17,610
And then we put more monkeys.

3236
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:19,650
Don't worry.

3237
01:58:19,730 --> 01:58:20,390
And then we put more.

3238
01:58:21,950 --> 01:58:22,830
And then...

3239
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:25,750
And then we do...

3240
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:26,590
And then we do...

3241
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:26,870
This too.

3242
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:30,050
And then we save up more money...

3243
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:30,990
For more monkey.

3244
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:32,850
Okay.

3245
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:33,550
Fire bomb.

3246
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:35,910
And then uh...

3247
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:38,410
And then faster firing.

3248
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:39,330
There you go.

3249
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,890
And then...

3250
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:43,470
Monkey.

3251
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:44,850
Monkey.

3252
01:58:45,230 --> 01:58:45,650
Monkey.

3253
01:58:46,710 --> 01:58:47,630
Fire bomb.

3254
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:49,550
We need a baby.

3255
01:58:50,030 --> 01:58:50,930
Give me the baby.

3256
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:52,170
Oh shit.

3257
01:58:52,290 --> 01:58:53,450
I almost forgot to collect my money.

3258
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:55,610
Bye.

3259
01:58:56,650 --> 01:58:57,150
Come on.

3260
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:57,850
Give me the baby.

3261
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:59,790
We're so close.

3262
01:59:00,130 --> 01:59:00,990
We're so close.

3263
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:01,610
The babies.

3264
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:03,250
Okay.

3265
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:04,290
Oh no.

3266
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,690
It's okay.

3267
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,150
It's okay.

3268
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:06,710
It's okay.

3269
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:07,130
It's okay.

3270
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:07,990
It's okay.

3271
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:09,530
It's okay.

3272
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:10,770
It's okay.

3273
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:12,810
It's okay.

3274
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:14,890
It's okay.

3275
01:59:15,230 --> 01:59:15,690
It's okay.

3276
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:15,710
It's okay.

3277
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:35,580
It's okay.

3278
01:59:41,740 --> 01:59:42,800
Okay.

3279
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:47,520
Things were... things were not fine.

3280
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:49,440
What did I go wrong?

3281
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,260
I don't understand.

3282
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:58,500
What could have possibly gone wrong?

3283
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:03,400
I don't... I don't understand.

3284
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:05,680
What did I do wrong?

3285
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:10,220
I need more... not enough... Oh, you're right.

3286
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,900
It's just not enough ice monkey.

3287
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,240
Is that it?

3288
02:00:14,780 --> 02:00:16,020
You're right, guys.

3289
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:22,120
I don't understand what I did to fuck it up.

3290
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:25,680
I don't... I don't understand.

3291
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,920
Alright, you're right.

3292
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:30,880
I need more helicopters.

3293
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:31,600
There you go.

3294
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,220
Okay, there you go.

3295
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:36,020
That should work now, right?

3296
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,760
Okay.

3297
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,040
Oh my god.

3298
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:43,280
Um... Okay, let me slow this down.

3299
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:44,140
Oh my god.

3300
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:48,020
Let me... let me slow this down.

3301
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:51,380
So I can figure out what I'm doing wrong.

3302
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:52,480
I...

3303
02:00:54,980 --> 02:00:57,220
Like, I'm getting a little...

3304
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:00,320
There's a little too much stuff going on right now.

3305
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:03,160
Okay.

3306
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:03,680
Okay.

3307
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,140
Okay, what's better for...

3308
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:06,160
Um... what's better?

3309
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:09,140
Uh...

3310
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:14,820
More... what's better for... for... for... for... for... for super monkey?

3311
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:15,920
Bottom?

3312
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:16,380
Okay.

3313
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:17,680
Bottom.

3314
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:19,200
Okay.

3315
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,520
Alright, it's fine.

3316
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:38,280
I can't... I can't... I just realized... I have nothing for camo.

3317
02:01:40,910 --> 02:01:41,740
It's fine.

3318
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:44,140
Alright, now that I know, I'm leaving.

3319
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,880
Now that I know, I leave.

3320
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:49,360
Alright, nice.

3321
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:50,480
Alright, hard road.

3322
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,520
Hey, we're getting better!

3323
02:01:54,520 --> 02:02:01,860
Alright, remember to not start off with... I need to remember to not start off with Ice Monkey.

3324
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:06,660
Despite how much I want to start off with Ice Monkey.

3325
02:02:06,660 --> 02:02:12,920
I... I need to remember, do not start off with Ice Monkey.

3326
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:17,420
You're right, I just didn't have enough Ice Monkey.

3327
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:18,140
You're right.

3328
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:20,100
But it's all gonna change here.

3329
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,960
Let me upgrade this part.

3330
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,800
It's all gonna change here.

3331
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:28,100
What could go wrong?

3332
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:32,580
Ice Monkey, go clap!

3333
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:37,060
Come on, give me my Ice Monkey.

3334
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:40,920
Alright.

3335
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:46,290
Come on, we're almost there.

3336
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:50,210
Alright, there you go.

3337
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:53,770
I always knew this was the right idea.

3338
02:02:54,190 --> 02:02:57,030
I don't know which pathway is better though, guys.

3339
02:02:58,310 --> 02:03:01,090
Which... what do we do for the pathway for Ice Monkey?

3340
02:03:01,810 --> 02:03:03,010
Oh, this is bad.

3341
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:09,850
Do we need a top... I don't know.

3342
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:11,190
I've been, like, experimenting.

3343
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:13,670
Top path is better?

3344
02:03:13,890 --> 02:03:14,350
These two?

3345
02:03:15,150 --> 02:03:15,630
Okay.

3346
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:17,410
And then we'll save for Gwen.

3347
02:03:20,910 --> 02:03:21,390
Alright.

3348
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:25,510
It's gonna take a while to save though.

3349
02:03:26,610 --> 02:03:26,930
Okay.

3350
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:30,430
Or I could get Ice Monkey again.

3351
02:03:31,030 --> 02:03:33,650
Ooh, I could get Ice Monkey again though.

3352
02:03:34,330 --> 02:03:34,590
Ah.

3353
02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:36,730
It's just so...

3354
02:03:36,730 --> 02:03:37,770
Guys, you don't understand.

3355
02:03:38,170 --> 02:03:39,650
It's just so tempting.

3356
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:41,790
It's like, she's like, right there.

3357
02:03:41,970 --> 02:03:42,890
It's like, right there.

3358
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:45,130
Like, can you really blame me?

3359
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:46,970
Ha ha ha ha.

3360
02:03:48,170 --> 02:03:48,690
It's...

3361
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:50,070
Can you really blame me?

3362
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:51,350
She's like, right there.

3363
02:03:54,070 --> 02:03:54,590
Alright.

3364
02:03:55,230 --> 02:03:55,750
Upgrades.

3365
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:55,950
Upgrades.

3366
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:56,270
Okay.

3367
02:03:57,570 --> 02:03:58,130
Alright.

3368
02:03:58,470 --> 02:03:58,750
Now.

3369
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,470
Now.

3370
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:00,510
Now I upgrade.

3371
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:01,170
For real.

3372
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:01,550
Okay.

3373
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:03,510
I should grab camo stuff though.

3374
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:05,510
Uh.

3375
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:08,410
Okay.

3376
02:04:08,410 --> 02:04:08,930
I save.

3377
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:10,630
I save for a tree.

3378
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:11,930
For money.

3379
02:04:12,730 --> 02:04:13,950
Oh my god.

3380
02:04:14,110 --> 02:04:14,330
Okay.

3381
02:04:14,610 --> 02:04:15,570
This is bad.

3382
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:17,170
Sniper Monkey time.

3383
02:04:17,770 --> 02:04:19,510
When things get bad, it's sniping time.

3384
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:20,930
Okay.

3385
02:04:20,970 --> 02:04:21,850
Now I get Night Vision.

3386
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:23,390
And now I get Fast Firing.

3387
02:04:24,810 --> 02:04:25,790
Don't worry.

3388
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:27,650
When things get bad, we snipe.

3389
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:28,630
We start sniping.

3390
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,800
We're almost there.

3391
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:36,780
Alright.

3392
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:39,460
Oh, I got Night Monkey knowledge.

3393
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:40,780
I'm smarter now.

3394
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:43,680
Yay!

3395
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:46,960
Wait.

3396
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:48,280
Maybe I do larger raid.

3397
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:48,560
Uh.

3398
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:48,980
Actually.

3399
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,380
Enhance Freeze.

3400
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,480
Always upgrade my boy.

3401
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,000
Sniper Monkey.

3402
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:56,640
Oh shit.

3403
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,300
Fire bomb should be here.

3404
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:00,040
Fire bomb!

3405
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:03,980
Go do your fire bomb things!

3406
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:06,200
Oh shit!

3407
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:08,720
Whoops.

3408
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:10,660
Whoops.

3409
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:11,400
Oh.

3410
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:12,140
Wait.

3411
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:12,660
Guys.

3412
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:16,260
I should really start saving my money.

3413
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:19,920
Oops.

3414
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:23,140
Oh, I said as I upgrade.

3415
02:05:26,080 --> 02:05:28,600
I should really start saving my money.

3416
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:29,840
Okay.

3417
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:31,660
Now I'll start saving my money.

3418
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:33,820
Alright.

3419
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:35,320
This time.

3420
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:36,340
For real.

3421
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:40,260
And then I'll get the tree.

3422
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:41,780
Fire bomb!

3423
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:42,580
Whoops.

3424
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,440
Too early.

3425
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,140
Will I ever learn my lesson?

3426
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:51,260
Let's fire it out.

3427
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,360
Fire bomb!

3428
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:56,240
Okay.

3429
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:57,700
Okay.

3430
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,400
We're so close.

3431
02:05:58,580 --> 02:05:58,740
Okay.

3432
02:05:58,820 --> 02:05:59,820
I need to slow things down.

3433
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:00,500
I can't.

3434
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:03,380
This is a little too rough for me right now.

3435
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,680
Things gotta slow down a little bit.

3436
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:08,180
Okay.

3437
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:10,440
Don't worry.

3438
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:11,140
Guys.

3439
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:12,480
We have to slow things down.

3440
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:14,200
Or I'm gonna be so overwhelmed.

3441
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,200
I...

3442
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:19,380
I...

3443
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:19,840
I...

3444
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:20,960
I...

3445
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:21,040
I...

3446
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:21,300
I need it.

3447
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:22,960
Fire bomb!

3448
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:25,780
Things are a little too much for my brain right now.

3449
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:26,180
Oh.

3450
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:28,520
Alright.

3451
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,360
We're almost there.

3452
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,640
We almost have the helicopter.

3453
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,400
We don't need cannons, guys.

3454
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,580
All we need is a helicopter.

3455
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:39,420
And Gwen.

3456
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:41,020
And ice monkey.

3457
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:42,520
Okay.

3458
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:43,380
I'm almost there.

3459
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:46,740
Helicopter.

3460
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:48,480
There we go.

3461
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:49,600
Oh.

3462
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:51,580
Things are not looking so good right now.

3463
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:52,260
But it's okay.

3464
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,400
That's what the helicopter's for.

3465
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:55,880
That's okay.

3466
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,300
That's what the helicopter's for.

3467
02:06:58,540 --> 02:06:59,860
It's okay, guys.

3468
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:01,280
We're fine.

3469
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:03,860
We have the helicopter here.

3470
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:05,840
We're so healthy.

3471
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,900
That's what it is.

3472
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:13,800
We're almost there.

3473
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:19,680
The helicopter's here to save the day, guys.

3474
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:22,480
Okay.

3475
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,640
We need 540 and then we're fine.

3476
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:26,700
There you go.

3477
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:30,180
Okay.

3478
02:07:30,460 --> 02:07:30,720
Nice.

3479
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:30,800
Nice.

3480
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:34,160
Okay.

3481
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:35,160
This is bad.

3482
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:38,380
We only have one guy that can see through camo.

3483
02:07:42,210 --> 02:07:42,990
This is okay.

3484
02:07:43,730 --> 02:07:44,470
It's okay.

3485
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:46,090
He's doing it.

3486
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:47,710
We have to slow it down a little.

3487
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:48,450
You don't understand.

3488
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:50,430
My brain was starting to hurt.

3489
02:07:50,750 --> 02:07:52,050
We have to...

3490
02:07:52,050 --> 02:07:52,390
Okay.

3491
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:54,610
We can move it a little bit fast.

3492
02:07:54,610 --> 02:07:54,990
Okay.

3493
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:56,530
Now we slow it down.

3494
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:58,970
Now we slow it down.

3495
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:01,710
So I know what to do after.

3496
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:03,490
All right.

3497
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:05,630
Okay.

3498
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:08,910
Now we can afford...

3499
02:08:10,230 --> 02:08:11,830
What do we afford next?

3500
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:12,250
Okay.

3501
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:13,430
Now we can upgrade the banana.

3502
02:08:15,350 --> 02:08:19,070
My poor little brain was not going to be okay.

3503
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:22,030
And then helicopter.

3504
02:08:22,650 --> 02:08:24,050
And then we need faster darts.

3505
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:26,950
So he can see...

3506
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:27,670
Okay.

3507
02:08:27,670 --> 02:08:29,850
We need to upgrade this so he can start seeing camo.

3508
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:32,370
Oh my god.

3509
02:08:32,370 --> 02:08:32,690
Please.

3510
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:34,570
I can't upgrade anything yet.

3511
02:08:35,410 --> 02:08:36,610
Go bottom banana.

3512
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:39,010
Okay.

3513
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:39,810
But like...

3514
02:08:39,810 --> 02:08:40,390
He starts...

3515
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:41,850
He needs to see the stuff right now.

3516
02:08:43,430 --> 02:08:44,110
All right.

3517
02:08:44,490 --> 02:08:45,090
This one?

3518
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:47,770
But then it does halfway.

3519
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:50,890
Banana salvage?

3520
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:51,170
Ooh.

3521
02:08:51,330 --> 02:08:52,170
Banana salvage.

3522
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:52,470
Ooh.

3523
02:08:52,670 --> 02:08:53,530
Banana marketplace.

3524
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:54,150
Ooh.

3525
02:08:54,790 --> 02:08:55,450
All right.

3526
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:56,290
Okay.

3527
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:57,030
Now I don't have to collect.

3528
02:08:58,030 --> 02:08:58,930
All right.

3529
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:00,930
And now...

3530
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:04,010
Now I can upgrade to my content.

3531
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:08,620
Okay.

3532
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:09,920
Hold snap.

3533
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,620
All right.

3534
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:16,980
Oh.

3535
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:19,800
I realized I upgraded the wrong camo.

3536
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:20,180
Whoops.

3537
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:22,280
It's okay.

3538
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:23,680
That's what the second...

3539
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:26,100
The second helicopter is for, guys.

3540
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:28,980
That's what the second helicopter is for.

3541
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:29,780
Oh my god.

3542
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,340
My monkey was never upgraded.

3543
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,700
Oh my god.

3544
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,040
Okay.

3545
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,080
Okay.

3546
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:37,440
I'll do middle.

3547
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:38,540
Whoops.

3548
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:39,580
That was my bad.

3549
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,440
I didn't realize I never upgraded my other monkeys.

3550
02:09:42,820 --> 02:09:43,340
No.

3551
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:44,400
We're not cooked, guys.

3552
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:45,940
Things will be okay.

3553
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:46,760
I have enough.

3554
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:47,120
Okay.

3555
02:09:47,260 --> 02:09:48,500
Now I can go a little faster.

3556
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:51,440
My brain is okay now.

3557
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:52,980
Now I can go.

3558
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,760
Now it's fine.

3559
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,220
We'll get the second helicopter and everything will be fine.

3560
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:00,400
And then I'll put fireball in here.

3561
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,680
And then we have a second helicopter.

3562
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:04,660
We called in the second buddy.

3563
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:09,100
And then we'll have 650 and then we'll have this guy.

3564
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:11,620
And then fireball.

3565
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:12,860
And then now we're fine.

3566
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,200
Now we're fine.

3567
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:17,140
And then we get Superman in here.

3568
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:20,900
All right.

3569
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,740
There we go.

3570
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,440
And then we save up for Superman.

3571
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:29,460
Or we can do Ice Bucky.

3572
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:34,970
Or we have Ice Bucky here.

3573
02:10:37,030 --> 02:10:38,510
I think it's more important.

3574
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:41,230
Honestly, Ice Bucky was like the play.

3575
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:44,890
Yay, Ice Bucky.

3576
02:10:45,730 --> 02:10:47,310
I just think it was a play.

3577
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:47,910
Okay, guys.

3578
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:50,770
I think it was the right play to do.

3579
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,670
You just don't understand.

3580
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:57,670
Okay, Super Monkey is 2,000.

3581
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:58,750
I think we can afford it.

3582
02:11:00,350 --> 02:11:01,750
You always go more Ice.

3583
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:02,390
Exactly!

3584
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:02,990
Exactly!

3585
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:04,850
You know what's up?

3586
02:11:05,310 --> 02:11:06,750
Ice is always a play.

3587
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:11,310
Okay, and then we get Super Range.

3588
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:14,230
Super Range and not back.

3589
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:15,610
Okay, and then...

3590
02:11:16,230 --> 02:11:18,390
And then we deep freeze.

3591
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:19,710
More freeze.

3592
02:11:20,490 --> 02:11:22,330
And I guess we can upgrade our...

3593
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:23,650
No, we save up for more planes.

3594
02:11:24,230 --> 02:11:26,190
That was our strat last time and it worked.

3595
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:27,730
Or do I...

3596
02:11:27,730 --> 02:11:28,690
Actually...

3597
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:30,050
No, you're right.

3598
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:31,570
Plane is always the answer.

3599
02:11:32,450 --> 02:11:33,870
You're so right, guys.

3600
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:38,450
You're so right.

3601
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:42,130
Plane is always the answer.

3602
02:11:44,190 --> 02:11:44,750
Okay.

3603
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:46,010
It's okay.

3604
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:46,990
We're almost there.

3605
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:48,170
There we go.

3606
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:49,610
And then...

3607
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,450
Faster darts.

3608
02:11:50,630 --> 02:11:50,890
Faster.

3609
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:53,030
And then we get a save up for 3,000.

3610
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:54,810
Fireball!

3611
02:11:56,970 --> 02:11:57,510
Oh, wait.

3612
02:11:57,550 --> 02:11:58,070
I can get more.

3613
02:11:58,350 --> 02:11:58,830
All right.

3614
02:11:59,010 --> 02:11:59,270
Nice.

3615
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,910
And then...

3616
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:03,130
What do I want again?

3617
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:03,950
I already forgot.

3618
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:05,550
I hit some...

3619
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:06,450
Oh, you're right.

3620
02:12:06,450 --> 02:12:06,930
More ice.

3621
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:08,810
How could I forget?

3622
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:09,830
More ice.

3623
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:10,670
Oh, yeah.

3624
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:11,770
I need the Mob's Chove.

3625
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:13,170
I forgot to get that.

3626
02:12:13,930 --> 02:12:14,570
That's okay.

3627
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:15,750
We're almost there anyway.

3628
02:12:16,950 --> 02:12:17,470
Fireball!

3629
02:12:19,470 --> 02:12:20,130
All right.

3630
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:22,030
That's okay.

3631
02:12:22,030 --> 02:12:22,890
I'm almost there.

3632
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,670
We're almost there.

3633
02:12:25,710 --> 02:12:26,190
There we go.

3634
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:26,750
All right.

3635
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:29,270
Now we just focus on upgrading our little guys.

3636
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:32,250
What is this?

3637
02:12:32,370 --> 02:12:32,590
Okay.

3638
02:12:33,010 --> 02:12:33,530
This...

3639
02:12:33,530 --> 02:12:34,230
We'll do this, too.

3640
02:12:35,150 --> 02:12:35,830
All right.

3641
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:37,350
And then...

3642
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,970
It's ice time.

3643
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:38,650
Yay!

3644
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:40,230
One monkey knowledge point!

3645
02:12:40,690 --> 02:12:41,210
Yippee!

3646
02:12:44,650 --> 02:12:45,170
Okay.

3647
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:45,850
And then him.

3648
02:12:47,850 --> 02:12:48,890
And then...

3649
02:12:49,710 --> 02:12:50,450
You there.

3650
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:52,030
That's right.

3651
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:52,370
You there.

3652
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:52,670
Oh, wait.

3653
02:12:52,690 --> 02:12:53,590
I should get camo.

3654
02:12:53,850 --> 02:12:55,390
I almost forgot about camo.

3655
02:12:56,010 --> 02:12:58,130
Camo, I think, is pretty important.

3656
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:02,830
It's okay.

3657
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:05,230
I have everything I need in the world.

3658
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:06,790
Okay.

3659
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:07,570
We just have to save it.

3660
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:08,570
Save up for this.

3661
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:10,710
And this should be fine.

3662
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:11,230
All right.

3663
02:13:11,370 --> 02:13:11,730
Upgrade.

3664
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:14,470
Faster, bigger stacks, longer reach.

3665
02:13:14,650 --> 02:13:15,430
Let's do...

3666
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:16,170
These two.

3667
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:18,670
Let's go.

3668
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:20,030
All right.

3669
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:21,910
All right.

3670
02:13:22,030 --> 02:13:22,190
Five.

3671
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:22,550
Okay.

3672
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:23,550
I put it too early.

3673
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:24,630
That's okay.

3674
02:13:26,270 --> 02:13:27,050
That's five.

3675
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:31,350
Nine thousand.

3676
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:31,970
Okay.

3677
02:13:32,030 --> 02:13:33,810
I don't know if I can save up for more babies.

3678
02:13:34,070 --> 02:13:34,470
I...

3679
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:39,350
I don't know if I have enough for more babies, guys.

3680
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:41,330
Okay.

3681
02:13:41,650 --> 02:13:42,150
Upgrade.

3682
02:13:43,450 --> 02:13:44,670
Get you in there.

3683
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:46,430
Get you in there.

3684
02:13:47,350 --> 02:13:48,490
Oh, I need marketplace.

3685
02:13:48,730 --> 02:13:49,250
Oh, you're right.

3686
02:13:50,510 --> 02:13:51,550
You're so right.

3687
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:53,190
All right.

3688
02:13:53,330 --> 02:13:54,210
We're almost there anyway.

3689
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:56,630
Come on.

3690
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:57,590
Give me my marketplace.

3691
02:13:58,370 --> 02:13:59,110
That's right.

3692
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:03,150
Don't worry.

3693
02:14:04,030 --> 02:14:05,590
My monkey's strong.

3694
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:07,830
Monkey's so strong.

3695
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:10,770
Oh, my God.

3696
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:13,250
I am generating a lot of money right now.

3697
02:14:14,690 --> 02:14:15,890
I need more.

3698
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:19,630
I need more money.

3699
02:14:20,330 --> 02:14:21,710
Give me more.

3700
02:14:21,710 --> 02:14:24,070
More money.

3701
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:28,470
Monkey demands to be stronger.

3702
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:32,050
True.

3703
02:14:32,810 --> 02:14:33,150
Hey, look.

3704
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:33,490
All right.

3705
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:35,690
Let's save up for nine thousand and then make babies.

3706
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:37,690
Or...

3707
02:14:37,690 --> 02:14:38,850
Ice monkey.

3708
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:41,270
Ice monkey angi.

3709
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:44,770
Ice monkey angi.

3710
02:14:49,610 --> 02:14:52,370
Ice monkey is so angry.

3711
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:53,750
Oh, wait.

3712
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:54,270
I can do that.

3713
02:14:55,070 --> 02:14:56,090
What is he going to do?

3714
02:14:56,250 --> 02:14:56,830
Nothing.

3715
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:58,830
That's right.

3716
02:15:00,830 --> 02:15:01,790
Nothing.

3717
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:04,730
I have the marketplace.

3718
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:07,530
I control the market now.

3719
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:11,770
Ice monkey clutch.

3720
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:15,090
Monkey controls marketplace.

3721
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:21,590
Oh, it's in the back now.

3722
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:25,250
That's right.

3723
02:15:25,570 --> 02:15:26,090
Oh, my God.

3724
02:15:26,210 --> 02:15:28,030
This dart monkey has never been upgraded.

3725
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:31,290
I forgot to upgrade him.

3726
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,550
Okay.

3727
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:33,410
Oh, my God.

3728
02:15:33,530 --> 02:15:35,450
Look at all these darts everywhere.

3729
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:37,610
Oh, it's lagging.

3730
02:15:39,550 --> 02:15:40,530
Oh, my God.

3731
02:15:40,530 --> 02:15:42,290
There are too many darts.

3732
02:15:42,610 --> 02:15:45,210
It actually lagged my game.

3733
02:15:45,650 --> 02:15:47,490
There are too many darts.

3734
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,430
The crate.

3735
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:52,570
I put too many.

3736
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:56,550
The game didn't know what to do anymore.

3737
02:15:58,690 --> 02:16:00,070
Jesus Christ.

3738
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:04,290
Like, what can I upgrade at this point?

3739
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:06,610
All right.

3740
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:07,130
Nice.

3741
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:08,010
I can do this again.

3742
02:16:09,410 --> 02:16:09,690
Yay!

3743
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:13,210
I got another monkey knowledge point!

3744
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:16,670
Okay.

3745
02:16:17,150 --> 02:16:18,130
I think it's just...

3746
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:18,430
Yeah.

3747
02:16:18,530 --> 02:16:19,530
I just have to wait now.

3748
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:21,210
I'm too strong.

3749
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:23,050
I can't...

3750
02:16:23,050 --> 02:16:23,410
Okay.

3751
02:16:23,410 --> 02:16:24,190
I can level up this.

3752
02:16:24,490 --> 02:16:26,030
I was going to say, I can't level up anything.

3753
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:30,450
All my stuff is too strong.

3754
02:16:32,910 --> 02:16:33,510
Yeah.

3755
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:35,130
I can level up this.

3756
02:16:35,930 --> 02:16:36,510
All right.

3757
02:16:36,630 --> 02:16:36,910
Nice.

3758
02:16:39,570 --> 02:16:40,170
Okay.

3759
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:41,650
9,180.

3760
02:16:42,930 --> 02:16:43,530
Okay.

3761
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:45,090
I just need 9,000.

3762
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:47,930
But I can generate more here.

3763
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:49,910
There you go.

3764
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:52,950
I can passively generate income.

3765
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:54,530
Oh my god.

3766
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:56,310
Okay.

3767
02:16:56,470 --> 02:16:57,110
How good...

3768
02:16:57,110 --> 02:16:58,510
How good my income is now.

3769
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:00,870
I can passively generate income.

3770
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:04,510
And then I should be able to get 9,000 right off the bat.

3771
02:17:04,830 --> 02:17:06,050
I'm just farming.

3772
02:17:06,410 --> 02:17:08,030
That's all I just gotta do.

3773
02:17:09,350 --> 02:17:10,710
I just farm.

3774
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:12,990
And then with that...

3775
02:17:13,610 --> 02:17:16,210
I should be able to have the babies so fast.

3776
02:17:17,550 --> 02:17:18,910
It's in the bag.

3777
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:20,870
All right.

3778
02:17:21,050 --> 02:17:22,250
9,000.

3779
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:25,990
The banana investment of 2025.

3780
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:28,250
Oh my god.

3781
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:29,010
I'm just waiting.

3782
02:17:30,390 --> 02:17:32,350
Where are my balloons?

3783
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:33,970
Give me my babies.

3784
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:37,410
I demand the babies.

3785
02:17:38,810 --> 02:17:39,450
There you go.

3786
02:17:39,630 --> 02:17:39,830
Yay!

3787
02:17:42,390 --> 02:17:43,190
Yay.

3788
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:44,390
I got the babies.

3789
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:45,650
Yippee.

3790
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:46,830
Yippee.

3791
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:50,430
All right.

3792
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:51,390
Now I just wait.

3793
02:17:52,410 --> 02:17:54,530
I think I upgraded everything I need to upgrade.

3794
02:17:54,670 --> 02:17:55,090
That's cheap.

3795
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:57,310
Right?

3796
02:17:57,830 --> 02:17:58,270
Yeah.

3797
02:17:59,310 --> 02:18:00,690
37, 8,000.

3798
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:01,510
It's just this guy.

3799
02:18:01,890 --> 02:18:03,090
Oh, also this guy, I guess.

3800
02:18:04,690 --> 02:18:05,570
And then...

3801
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:06,510
Yeah.

3802
02:18:06,670 --> 02:18:07,070
Supply.

3803
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:07,410
Drop.

3804
02:18:07,570 --> 02:18:07,710
Yeah.

3805
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:08,810
It's just literally this guy.

3806
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:10,070
Just getting him out of the way.

3807
02:18:11,110 --> 02:18:11,630
All right.

3808
02:18:11,670 --> 02:18:12,630
I just need 8,000.

3809
02:18:13,850 --> 02:18:15,610
Just a simple 8,000.

3810
02:18:18,390 --> 02:18:19,390
Oh my god.

3811
02:18:19,510 --> 02:18:20,070
Look at...

3812
02:18:20,070 --> 02:18:20,910
He's...

3813
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:21,950
Oh, I did it?

3814
02:18:22,050 --> 02:18:22,330
Oh no.

3815
02:18:22,410 --> 02:18:23,070
I just got $200.

3816
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:25,850
Please.

3817
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:27,410
Oh, nice.

3818
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:29,050
Oh my god.

3819
02:18:29,050 --> 02:18:29,970
He's robo.

3820
02:18:30,310 --> 02:18:32,070
He's robo monkey now.

3821
02:18:34,570 --> 02:18:35,710
Burn it all.

3822
02:18:37,790 --> 02:18:38,710
What is it?

3823
02:18:38,970 --> 02:18:40,090
Do nothing.

3824
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:41,310
You know what?

3825
02:18:41,310 --> 02:18:43,350
Let's put another super monkey in here.

3826
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:45,910
Go have fun, super monkey.

3827
02:18:47,310 --> 02:18:48,810
Go do your thing.

3828
02:18:49,590 --> 02:18:51,210
I have so much money.

3829
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:53,610
It doesn't matter to me.

3830
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:56,550
I just...

3831
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:57,410
I'm just too rich.

3832
02:19:01,390 --> 02:19:02,170
All right.

3833
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:03,510
And then we need knock back here.

3834
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:14,610
He's just chilling.

3835
02:19:17,430 --> 02:19:18,390
You know what?

3836
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:20,050
More ice monkey.

3837
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:24,110
More ice

3838
02:19:28,650 --> 02:19:29,090
monkey.

3839
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:35,010
I demand more ice monkey.

3840
02:19:35,810 --> 02:19:36,570
I demand more ice monkey.

3841
02:19:36,570 --> 02:19:37,770
Get him.

3842
02:19:40,810 --> 02:19:42,350
Wait, what's that?

3843
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:44,790
What the fuck is that?

3844
02:19:44,790 --> 02:19:46,070
Oh, shit.

3845
02:19:46,530 --> 02:19:47,470
What the fuck?

3846
02:19:48,570 --> 02:19:49,550
What is that?

3847
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:53,350
Don't worry.

3848
02:19:53,450 --> 02:19:54,570
My ice monkey is...

3849
02:19:54,570 --> 02:19:55,610
Oh, it's over.

3850
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:56,450
Never mind.

3851
02:19:56,590 --> 02:19:57,410
My ice monkey did it.

3852
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:00,210
Free play.

3853
02:20:01,010 --> 02:20:02,090
I don't care.

3854
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:04,210
I want more ice monkey in here.

3855
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:06,850
I don't care.

3856
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:08,870
I want to know how far I can get.

3857
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:11,710
Just put it all in here.

3858
02:20:14,770 --> 02:20:16,210
Get them all in.

3859
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:20,550
I don't care.

3860
02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:24,990
Get in here.

3861
02:20:24,990 --> 02:20:26,610
It's ice monkey time.

3862
02:20:27,870 --> 02:20:29,090
This is my strat.

3863
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:32,330
This is my ice monkey strat.

3864
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:33,610
In the event, it will work.

3865
02:20:34,850 --> 02:20:36,970
Ice monkey time.

3866
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:39,530
They have to get through here first.

3867
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:46,410
They got to get through my ice monkey path.

3868
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:49,190
If they want to do anything.

3869
02:20:50,310 --> 02:20:52,570
Her ice kingdom is growing.

3870
02:20:54,550 --> 02:20:55,510
That's right.

3871
02:20:57,050 --> 02:21:00,630
You got to get past this area first.

3872
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:04,530
All right.

3873
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:08,630
I'll be impressed if it can get through here.

3874
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:11,590
Get through my little...

3875
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:12,410
Little...

3876
02:21:12,410 --> 02:21:14,350
Rain of terror of ice.

3877
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:19,220
Oh my god.

3878
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:20,960
My game is like...

3879
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,080
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

3880
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:23,160
We're good.

3881
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:29,620
My game is not okay right now.

3882
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:32,960
Crit, crit, crit, crit.

3883
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:35,740
All right.

3884
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:37,260
Now he's the dark knight.

3885
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,800
I can make more money.

3886
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:42,460
Let's make more money, guys.

3887
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,300
Oh my god.

3888
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:46,960
I can make more money.

3889
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:49,540
All right.

3890
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:50,800
I need 2,000.

3891
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:54,120
Let's make more money so I can put more ice monkeys in here.

3892
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:55,300
Uh...

3893
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:58,080
Her PC's gonna blow up.

3894
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:00,600
No, it's fine.

3895
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:01,500
Wait, what's this?

3896
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:03,420
I can clone myself?

3897
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:06,420
What does he do?

3898
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:10,020
Oh, does he like go somewhere?

3899
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:10,480
Okay.

3900
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:13,100
All right.

3901
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:13,440
Nice.

3902
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:15,840
And then let me get the marketplace.

3903
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,600
And then get the central market.

3904
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:19,200
All right.

3905
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:19,700
Nice.

3906
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:23,020
All right.

3907
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:25,540
And then we'll put more ice monkeys.

3908
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:30,770
It's fine.

3909
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:34,890
All right.

3910
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:39,300
All right.

3911
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:39,600
Nice.

3912
02:22:39,740 --> 02:22:40,120
There you go.

3913
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:42,640
And then we'll put more here.

3914
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:44,240
More here.

3915
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:47,400
And then I can't see anything anymore.

3916
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,800
But like, I think it's doing okay.

3917
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:50,860
I...

3918
02:22:52,880 --> 02:22:53,600
I...

3919
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:54,280
I...

3920
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:55,420
I...

3921
02:22:55,420 --> 02:22:56,960
I think things are okay right now.

3922
02:22:57,100 --> 02:22:58,240
I can't see anything.

3923
02:22:58,240 --> 02:22:59,980
But I think...

3924
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,000
I...

3925
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,120
I don't know where any of my stuff is anymore.

3926
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:14,960
Um...

3927
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:17,680
But I think everything is okay.

3928
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:21,120
All right.

3929
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:22,360
And then we add...

3930
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:24,500
Another helicopter.

3931
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:25,960
It doesn't hurt.

3932
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:27,720
You have more helicopters.

3933
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,440
And then...

3934
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:31,720
Bigger chest.

3935
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:33,040
There you go.

3936
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:34,260
All right.

3937
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:35,280
And then...

3938
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,260
And then more ice monkeys.

3939
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:40,220
Put it in here.

3940
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:42,920
And then we'll put you here.

3941
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:44,420
Wait.

3942
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:45,180
Can I not put more?

3943
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:45,600
I can.

3944
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:45,980
Okay.

3945
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,400
I can always put more.

3946
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:50,840
Don't worry.

3947
02:23:51,080 --> 02:23:52,280
I can always put more.

3948
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:53,860
Don't worry.

3949
02:23:54,580 --> 02:23:56,100
I can't...

3950
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:58,860
Nothing can stop him.

3951
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:02,840
Nothing can stop my army.

3952
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:06,940
All right.

3953
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,100
Let's see if we can save up to 21k.

3954
02:24:10,340 --> 02:24:11,100
Wait.

3955
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:12,780
Wait.

3956
02:24:13,700 --> 02:24:14,040
Wait.

3957
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:15,240
My army might be stopped.

3958
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:16,540
Wait.

3959
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:18,180
No.

3960
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:19,300
That's not possible.

3961
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:21,560
That's not possible.

3962
02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:25,400
I refuse to believe.

3963
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,220
I refuse to believe.

3964
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,720
My army of ice will stop them.

3965
02:24:39,820 --> 02:24:41,200
This is it.

3966
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:45,640
My army of ice cannot be stopped.

3967
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:53,570
Oh my god.

3968
02:24:53,970 --> 02:24:54,130
Wait.

3969
02:24:54,410 --> 02:24:54,830
They're...

3970
02:24:57,470 --> 02:24:58,630
Wait a minute.

3971
02:24:59,170 --> 02:25:00,930
That's a lot of stuff.

3972
02:25:02,970 --> 02:25:03,610
Okay.

3973
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:04,110
Wait.

3974
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:04,870
I'm almost there.

3975
02:25:05,150 --> 02:25:06,650
I almost got...

3976
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:09,130
The big guns!

3977
02:25:09,890 --> 02:25:10,590
The big guns!

3978
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:12,570
Don't worry.

3979
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:13,870
I have the big guns here.

3980
02:25:13,870 --> 02:25:15,570
And then we put more helicopter.

3981
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:18,230
Don't worry.

3982
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:20,250
Put more helicopter.

3983
02:25:22,130 --> 02:25:23,050
That's fine.

3984
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:25,470
And then we'll do...

3985
02:25:25,470 --> 02:25:26,570
Bigger jets.

3986
02:25:27,430 --> 02:25:28,430
There you go.

3987
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:31,070
And then firebomb.

3988
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:32,270
I don't think that does anything.

3989
02:25:32,270 --> 02:25:34,390
And then we'll add...

3990
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:35,270
More helicopter.

3991
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:37,730
It's fine.

3992
02:25:38,130 --> 02:25:40,010
What is this?

3993
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:46,350
It's fine.

3994
02:25:47,370 --> 02:25:48,330
It's fine.

3995
02:25:48,470 --> 02:25:49,210
Things are okay.

3996
02:25:49,930 --> 02:25:51,110
And then...

3997
02:25:51,110 --> 02:25:52,850
We'll add more ice monkeys here.

3998
02:25:53,170 --> 02:25:53,450
Oh!

3999
02:25:53,690 --> 02:25:53,850
Wait.

4000
02:25:54,010 --> 02:25:54,690
Things are not fine.

4001
02:25:57,630 --> 02:25:58,270
No!

4002
02:25:59,810 --> 02:26:01,330
How could this be?

4003
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:04,870
How could this be?

4004
02:26:05,730 --> 02:26:09,370
You mean my ice monkeys didn't stop them?

4005
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:10,670
Oh!

4006
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:12,150
So close.

4007
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:14,470
We are almost at 100!

4008
02:26:15,210 --> 02:26:16,890
Guys, I might not...

4009
02:26:16,890 --> 02:26:17,710
I might have been...

4010
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:19,610
I flew too close to this.

4011
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:23,330
I should have built more ice monkeys.

4012
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:24,850
Yeah!

4013
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:25,990
I did it!

4014
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:28,170
I didn't put more...

4015
02:26:29,050 --> 02:26:31,330
The ice kingdom...

4016
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:31,970
Not...

4017
02:26:31,970 --> 02:26:33,070
I knew it!

4018
02:26:33,250 --> 02:26:36,410
How could I betray my ice monkeys like that?

4019
02:26:36,730 --> 02:26:40,810
I can't believe I betrayed them and went with helicopter!

4020
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:42,210
I...

4021
02:26:42,210 --> 02:26:42,610
No!

4022
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:45,670
The ice...

4023
02:26:54,330 --> 02:26:57,470
The ice melted!

4024
02:26:57,910 --> 02:27:02,870
How could I let this happen to my precious ice monkeys?

4025
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:04,110
How?

4026
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:10,330
Okay, but what about the ice monkeys?

4027
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:12,390
Which guys...

4028
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:13,010
Which upgrade...

4029
02:27:13,010 --> 02:27:13,310
Oh, wait.

4030
02:27:13,470 --> 02:27:13,910
This one.

4031
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:15,750
Super range.

4032
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:16,350
Wizard.

4033
02:27:16,830 --> 02:27:17,150
Wait.

4034
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:18,270
What is ice monkey?

4035
02:27:18,310 --> 02:27:19,770
Ice monkey is a primary, right?

4036
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:21,130
I...

4037
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:22,410
You take that back!

4038
02:27:22,730 --> 02:27:25,030
Ice monkeys are not the worst towers!

4039
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:27,090
You take that back!

4040
02:27:30,850 --> 02:27:32,970
That is your...

4041
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:35,030
That is your commander speaking!

4042
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:38,410
Okay.

4043
02:27:40,490 --> 02:27:41,790
Let's see.

4044
02:27:41,930 --> 02:27:43,530
I believe in...

4045
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:44,330
That's right!

4046
02:27:44,530 --> 02:27:45,830
Slap that dragon!

4047
02:27:47,420 --> 02:27:51,130
So, who's your favorite monkey champion?

4048
02:27:51,130 --> 02:27:52,870
Thank you for the super chat!

4049
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:53,410
Thank you!

4050
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:54,150
Thank you!

4051
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:55,070
Alright.

4052
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,530
Let's...

4053
02:27:55,530 --> 02:27:58,970
Let's assign that so I can upgrade my ice monkey.

4054
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:00,130
Um...

4055
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:01,990
Middle path on the left start.

4056
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:02,370
Okay.

4057
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:04,050
Um...

4058
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:04,270
Wait.

4059
02:28:04,310 --> 02:28:04,870
You mean here?

4060
02:28:05,270 --> 02:28:05,790
Whoops!

4061
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:06,930
Ha ha ha ha!

4062
02:28:08,110 --> 02:28:08,710
Uh...

4063
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:09,330
I went...

4064
02:28:09,330 --> 02:28:10,370
I did the wrong one.

4065
02:28:10,710 --> 02:28:12,990
I saw this and then I was like...

4066
02:28:12,990 --> 02:28:13,250
Ice!

4067
02:28:14,850 --> 02:28:15,450
Okay.

4068
02:28:15,510 --> 02:28:16,630
Inferno Rain upgrades.

4069
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:18,470
Free radius slightly increased.

4070
02:28:18,990 --> 02:28:19,290
Alright.

4071
02:28:19,490 --> 02:28:20,410
Tactical shooters.

4072
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:21,010
Oh wait!

4073
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:23,050
They can pop ice balloons now!

4074
02:28:23,670 --> 02:28:24,010
Nice!

4075
02:28:24,250 --> 02:28:24,370
Alright.

4076
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:25,610
And then we get...

4077
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:26,910
We should get this.

4078
02:28:29,030 --> 02:28:29,830
Alright.

4079
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:31,910
You take that back.

4080
02:28:33,290 --> 02:28:34,590
He is your father.

4081
02:28:34,990 --> 02:28:36,150
How dare you!

4082
02:28:36,770 --> 02:28:37,490
Ha ha ha!

4083
02:28:38,170 --> 02:28:38,730
Wait.

4084
02:28:38,770 --> 02:28:39,350
What's this?

4085
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:42,070
Create match?

4086
02:28:42,690 --> 02:28:43,970
Co-op challenge?

4087
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:45,030
Wait.

4088
02:28:45,070 --> 02:28:46,070
Is this a 1v1?

4089
02:28:48,150 --> 02:28:49,570
What is this?

4090
02:28:49,570 --> 02:28:50,730
Oh!

4091
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:51,130
Wait.

4092
02:28:51,290 --> 02:28:51,490
No.

4093
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:52,590
Ha ha ha!

4094
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:54,250
Co-op.

4095
02:28:54,750 --> 02:28:55,750
What's co-op?

4096
02:28:57,170 --> 02:28:57,690
Create.

4097
02:28:57,930 --> 02:28:58,990
Do we get to play together?

4098
02:28:59,510 --> 02:29:00,570
Alright guys.

4099
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:02,450
Carry me.

4100
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:04,190
Ha ha ha!

4101
02:29:05,470 --> 02:29:06,610
Ha ha ha!

4102
02:29:06,610 --> 02:29:06,730
Ha ha ha!

4103
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:09,430
Ha ha ha!

4104
02:29:10,170 --> 02:29:11,450
Carry me guys.

4105
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:13,170
I'm Rima Yankee.

4106
02:29:16,110 --> 02:29:17,230
Ha ha ha!

4107
02:29:17,410 --> 02:29:18,010
Ha ha ha!

4108
02:29:18,010 --> 02:29:19,030
Show me how it's done.

4109
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:21,070
Oh, you guys left already?

4110
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:21,990
Cowards.

4111
02:29:22,370 --> 02:29:23,110
Oh my god.

4112
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:23,550
All right.

4113
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:26,570
Show me how it's done.

4114
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:31,450
All right.

4115
02:29:32,250 --> 02:29:33,110
Where's Ice Monkey?

4116
02:29:33,490 --> 02:29:34,530
We share cash, right?

4117
02:29:41,730 --> 02:29:42,710
Hey, guys.

4118
02:29:43,050 --> 02:29:44,030
I got one.

4119
02:29:44,190 --> 02:29:45,910
I bought what I wanted.

4120
02:29:49,950 --> 02:29:50,950
It's so cute.

4121
02:29:51,670 --> 02:29:54,310
Guys, I did what I wanted to do.

4122
02:29:56,430 --> 02:29:57,630
Ice Monkey.

4123
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:02,870
I'm here to help out.

4124
02:30:04,450 --> 02:30:06,270
The most important.

4125
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:09,110
Yeah, this is the most important monkey.

4126
02:30:10,410 --> 02:30:10,850
All right.

4127
02:30:11,270 --> 02:30:11,590
Don't worry.

4128
02:30:11,690 --> 02:30:13,550
I got everything I wanted to put on.

4129
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:15,330
It's your turn, guys.

4130
02:30:16,330 --> 02:30:18,970
Frame one, Ice Monkey.

4131
02:30:23,010 --> 02:30:24,630
That's what we needed.

4132
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:25,790
All right.

4133
02:30:27,690 --> 02:30:28,590
Frame one.

4134
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:29,490
Don't worry.

4135
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:30,610
We share cash, though.

4136
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:37,110
I know what I'm contributing to this team.

4137
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:39,810
Ice Monkey.

4138
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:41,370
Don't worry.

4139
02:30:41,530 --> 02:30:41,690
Wait.

4140
02:30:42,330 --> 02:30:42,890
Wait.

4141
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:44,310
They took off.

4142
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:44,750
Don't worry.

4143
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:45,470
I got you.

4144
02:30:48,670 --> 02:30:49,570
There you go.

4145
02:30:49,950 --> 02:30:50,330
You don't.

4146
02:30:50,410 --> 02:30:51,630
Oh, we don't share cash.

4147
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:52,670
Okay.

4148
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:53,590
You guys are lucky.

4149
02:30:54,810 --> 02:30:58,170
I might have almost creeped us by doing that.

4150
02:30:58,750 --> 02:30:59,390
Whoa!

4151
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:01,490
We have so much money now!

4152
02:31:02,210 --> 02:31:02,750
Wait.

4153
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:03,910
Why do I have so much money?

4154
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:05,650
Don't worry.

4155
02:31:06,010 --> 02:31:08,010
My monkey is strong now.

4156
02:31:09,070 --> 02:31:09,230
Whoa!

4157
02:31:10,930 --> 02:31:12,710
I don't get so much!

4158
02:31:13,410 --> 02:31:14,810
What a bitch!

4159
02:31:15,370 --> 02:31:16,150
What a cash drop!

4160
02:31:16,690 --> 02:31:17,470
Nice!

4161
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:22,570
Someone's already paying the win!

4162
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:23,950
That's crazy!

4163
02:31:24,490 --> 02:31:25,990
Guys, we need another one!

4164
02:31:26,390 --> 02:31:27,070
We need...

4165
02:31:29,870 --> 02:31:32,950
Guys, guys, do another drop!

4166
02:31:34,570 --> 02:31:35,350
Whoa!

4167
02:31:35,650 --> 02:31:35,990
Let's go!

4168
02:31:39,130 --> 02:31:42,030
I know what I'm spending it on.

4169
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:43,750
Let's go.

4170
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:47,270
Let me make my strongest monkey.

4171
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:49,470
Let me make...

4172
02:31:49,470 --> 02:31:50,790
Don't enable it.

4173
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:55,610
I'm just making a strong monkey!

4174
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:57,490
Don't worry.

4175
02:31:57,790 --> 02:31:59,310
We'll put it on every ice here.

4176
02:32:00,910 --> 02:32:01,970
Don't worry.

4177
02:32:02,190 --> 02:32:02,770
Look at that.

4178
02:32:03,770 --> 02:32:04,890
Tier 5 of the most.

4179
02:32:04,990 --> 02:32:08,090
You can only have one of each path in play at a time.

4180
02:32:08,270 --> 02:32:09,070
Oh my god!

4181
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:10,730
He is a god!

4182
02:32:11,450 --> 02:32:14,250
He is an actual god now!

4183
02:32:15,010 --> 02:32:18,210
We have the ultimate ice monkey!

4184
02:32:19,450 --> 02:32:20,210
Truly.

4185
02:32:20,810 --> 02:32:22,970
We have reached peak Nirvana.

4186
02:32:23,810 --> 02:32:26,190
What the fuck is going on?

4187
02:32:26,750 --> 02:32:27,130
Wait.

4188
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:29,410
Why is he...

4189
02:32:29,410 --> 02:32:31,630
There's so many spikes!

4190
02:32:33,070 --> 02:32:33,610
Oh my...

4191
02:32:33,610 --> 02:32:36,170
Guys, is the game too loud or is it okay?

4192
02:32:36,870 --> 02:32:37,410
Is it...

4193
02:32:40,970 --> 02:32:42,130
It's a tag.

4194
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:46,170
They saved all the money.

4195
02:32:46,450 --> 02:32:47,710
It's a bit loud.

4196
02:32:48,130 --> 02:32:48,770
Whoops.

4197
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:49,410
Okay.

4198
02:32:50,130 --> 02:32:50,630
Alright.

4199
02:32:51,890 --> 02:32:52,410
They're good.

4200
02:32:52,730 --> 02:32:53,910
It has been loud!

4201
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:55,410
Why did no one say anything?!

4202
02:32:56,390 --> 02:32:57,590
Oh my god!

4203
02:32:58,850 --> 02:33:00,330
Why did no one say...

4204
02:33:00,330 --> 02:33:01,050
Oh my god!

4205
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:03,980
Let him want this!

4206
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:05,380
Wait!

4207
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:06,460
I want...

4208
02:33:06,460 --> 02:33:07,540
Why...

4209
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:09,540
It was...

4210
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:12,460
Why did you get all the money?!

4211
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:14,180
So...

4212
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:20,620
Oh, now it's too quiet?

4213
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:21,080
Okay.

4214
02:33:21,560 --> 02:33:23,620
I'll set the sound effects down.

4215
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:26,440
Alright.

4216
02:33:26,660 --> 02:33:27,280
Here you go.

4217
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:28,200
There you go.

4218
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:29,420
What's going on?

4219
02:33:30,260 --> 02:33:31,000
What's going on?

4220
02:33:31,180 --> 02:33:32,040
I don't even...

4221
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:32,860
Oh my god!

4222
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:33,360
I'm rich!

4223
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:35,180
You know what that means!

4224
02:33:35,960 --> 02:33:37,620
Ultimate Ice Monkey!

4225
02:33:38,920 --> 02:33:40,320
Oh my god!

4226
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:42,540
Don't worry.

4227
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:43,980
What do...

4228
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:45,680
Where can I push this?

4229
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:47,280
Where can I...

4230
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,120
Don't worry.

4231
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:50,020
There's still a place for him.

4232
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:51,100
Alright.

4233
02:33:52,580 --> 02:33:54,040
What have I not upgraded?

4234
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:54,660
Okay.

4235
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:55,980
It's super brittle.

4236
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:57,620
The bottom one.

4237
02:33:57,800 --> 02:33:57,960
Okay.

4238
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,780
We gotta make one for the bottom now.

4239
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:00,660
Wait.

4240
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:04,280
How do I make it so I can make the bottom one the ultimate monkey?

4241
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:05,320
How...

4242
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:06,820
She's gonna recreate.

4243
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:10,080
We need to get the 5 tier for this.

4244
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:12,140
How do I get it for this guy?

4245
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:14,140
We need all the ultimate monies...

4246
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:15,160
Monkeys.

4247
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:16,000
We need...

4248
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,520
We need every ultimate monkey possible.

4249
02:34:20,730 --> 02:34:21,780
You can't?

4250
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,100
It's bad?

4251
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:25,100
Oh my god.

4252
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:26,140
What's the point?

4253
02:34:26,940 --> 02:34:29,240
What's the point if it's bad?

4254
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:31,500
What's the point?

4255
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:32,320
Don't worry.

4256
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:33,360
I'll put you...

4257
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:35,240
Don't worry little guys.

4258
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:37,580
I'll make sure to take all the monkey paths.

4259
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:40,540
I'll make sure it is...

4260
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:43,280
I'll make sure this is just monkeys.

4261
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:45,340
Don't worry little guys.

4262
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:50,420
I'll make sure everything that's empty is just monkeys.

4263
02:34:56,320 --> 02:35:00,140
Everything you see here is the land of the monkeys.

4264
02:35:02,460 --> 02:35:03,180
I...

4265
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:04,000
There's no more...

4266
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:04,180
Oh wait.

4267
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:04,800
There's one more.

4268
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,720
There's one more right here.

4269
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:08,740
Let's go.

4270
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,200
There's one.

4271
02:35:12,460 --> 02:35:16,300
Let's make sure there's no other path but monkey.

4272
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,780
The ice monkey strat is here.

4273
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:21,080
Yippee.

4274
02:35:21,300 --> 02:35:22,100
I've taken...

4275
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:23,840
I've taken the whole place.

4276
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:25,400
It's just me.

4277
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:28,160
A lot of fire and ice.

4278
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:29,720
It's like lava...

4279
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:31,200
What do the lavas do?

4280
02:35:31,240 --> 02:35:31,840
Is this cosmetic?

4281
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:33,740
What does this do?

4282
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:36,240
Guys, if we lose, it's not my fault.

4283
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:37,600
I'm just gonna say it.

4284
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:38,780
If we lose...

4285
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:44,060
Place ice monkey in the far left above...

4286
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:44,820
Oh my god.

4287
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:46,380
I can't even...

4288
02:35:46,380 --> 02:35:46,740
Where?

4289
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:49,900
Is there still a place for my little guys?

4290
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:52,720
Oh my god.

4291
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:53,220
There is.

4292
02:35:53,420 --> 02:35:55,040
Right in this tiny little corner.

4293
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:57,900
I knew there would always be a place for you.

4294
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:58,800
I...

4295
02:36:01,360 --> 02:36:02,520
Oh, there is!

4296
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:03,700
Nice.

4297
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:06,160
Okay.

4298
02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:09,320
There's always a place for you, my little man.

4299
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:12,040
There's always a place for you.

4300
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:13,900
Do not worry.

4301
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:16,400
Do not worry.

4302
02:36:17,080 --> 02:36:19,300
You'll always have a home here.

4303
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:21,400
You'll always...

4304
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:23,500
Do not worry.

4305
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:24,740
Drown.

4306
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:26,080
Again.

4307
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:26,940
Yippee!

4308
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:31,760
Everybody's so rich.

4309
02:36:33,020 --> 02:36:36,420
There's always gonna be a place for all of you.

4310
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:38,920
Alright, nice.

4311
02:36:39,080 --> 02:36:40,340
I think we can win this, guys.

4312
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,180
Guys.

4313
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:43,460
I think we can win this.

4314
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:44,280
There's no way.

4315
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:45,440
Drown.

4316
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:47,000
Do not be afraid.

4317
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:51,120
Do not be afraid.

4318
02:36:51,180 --> 02:36:52,360
Oh my god, there's more!

4319
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:54,040
Nice.

4320
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,120
Do not be afraid!

4321
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:00,280
There's always a place for you!

4322
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:02,300
There's always a place for you!

4323
02:37:02,300 --> 02:37:02,980
Oh my god, there's some here.

4324
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:06,480
There's always gonna be an area for my eyes.

4325
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:08,780
Honestly, like, I don't...

4326
02:37:08,780 --> 02:37:09,840
What are these guys?

4327
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:11,300
A banana farmer?

4328
02:37:11,900 --> 02:37:13,660
Do they just give me more money?

4329
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,460
What is going on?

4330
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:21,680
What the fuck is going on in my screen right now?

4331
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:23,460
What is happening?

4332
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:26,120
What is going on?

4333
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:31,080
Okay, whatever that flashy thing is, get rid of it.

4334
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:33,620
I don't like it.

4335
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:36,280
I don't like the flashy things.

4336
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:37,400
Alright.

4337
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:39,200
Get rid of it.

4338
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,440
No flashy!

4339
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:44,040
Alright.

4340
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:46,700
Alright.

4341
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:47,580
Are we good?

4342
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:49,260
Do you think we can make it to 100?

4343
02:37:49,640 --> 02:37:50,160
Alright, guys.

4344
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:51,100
Goal is 100.

4345
02:37:52,620 --> 02:37:53,960
What am I gonna do here?

4346
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:56,800
I feel like I've, like, exhausted all my ice monkeys.

4347
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,280
Like, I've done my job.

4348
02:38:01,640 --> 02:38:02,400
Alright, wait.

4349
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:03,220
I got an idea.

4350
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:07,590
Okay.

4351
02:38:08,770 --> 02:38:10,590
The one helicopter back there.

4352
02:38:10,850 --> 02:38:12,150
Ha ha ha ha!

4353
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:17,270
The one helicopter back there.

4354
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:18,650
Ha ha ha ha!

4355
02:38:20,050 --> 02:38:21,130
Look at him go.

4356
02:38:21,430 --> 02:38:22,170
Oh my god.

4357
02:38:22,350 --> 02:38:23,830
It's starting to lag, guys.

4358
02:38:24,330 --> 02:38:24,410
No.

4359
02:38:24,910 --> 02:38:25,050
What?

4360
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:26,430
There we go.

4361
02:38:26,670 --> 02:38:27,450
I'm contributing.

4362
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:32,290
There's no way we could lose this now.

4363
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:34,270
There's no fucking way.

4364
02:38:35,130 --> 02:38:36,310
Am I going fast?

4365
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:37,090
Okay, no.

4366
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:38,050
Okay, now I am.

4367
02:38:39,070 --> 02:38:39,250
Alright.

4368
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:41,490
Nice!

4369
02:38:42,030 --> 02:38:42,530
I leveled up!

4370
02:38:42,910 --> 02:38:43,190
Easy.

4371
02:38:43,350 --> 02:38:43,570
Easy.

4372
02:38:43,570 --> 02:38:44,170
Level up.

4373
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:45,870
How could we lose?

4374
02:38:46,030 --> 02:38:46,950
Look at this build.

4375
02:38:48,510 --> 02:38:49,330
How could...

4376
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:50,290
Yeah, that one...

4377
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:53,430
That one heli might have been the game changer.

4378
02:38:54,330 --> 02:38:54,950
Look at that.

4379
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:58,430
I have God literally in the middle right here.

4380
02:38:59,970 --> 02:39:00,570
Wait.

4381
02:39:00,570 --> 02:39:02,930
Oh, am I changing the speed for...

4382
02:39:02,930 --> 02:39:03,490
Wait!

4383
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:06,090
Wait, why did you get rid of the lava?

4384
02:39:06,230 --> 02:39:06,970
Oh, you're right.

4385
02:39:07,770 --> 02:39:10,490
Get rid of the lava so we can put more helicopters.

4386
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:12,210
You're so right, guys.

4387
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:15,210
You guys know how to play the game.

4388
02:39:15,610 --> 02:39:16,330
That's right.

4389
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:18,090
Get rid of that.

4390
02:39:18,750 --> 02:39:19,790
Just put all heli.

4391
02:39:20,790 --> 02:39:22,530
We're just all helicopters now.

4392
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:25,210
This is a helicopter land now.

4393
02:39:26,770 --> 02:39:27,770
All helis.

4394
02:39:29,570 --> 02:39:30,650
Go in there.

4395
02:39:32,310 --> 02:39:33,230
Oh my God.

4396
02:39:33,410 --> 02:39:33,910
There's too many.

4397
02:39:34,130 --> 02:39:35,170
I placed it incorrectly.

4398
02:39:35,850 --> 02:39:36,330
I...

4399
02:39:39,530 --> 02:39:40,090
Okay.

4400
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,830
Alright.

4401
02:39:42,530 --> 02:39:43,770
And then bigger jets.

4402
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,270
Oh!

4403
02:39:47,070 --> 02:39:47,630
Okay.

4404
02:39:48,250 --> 02:39:48,810
Wait.

4405
02:39:49,010 --> 02:39:50,670
That's 40,000 XP.

4406
02:39:50,810 --> 02:39:51,150
I don't...

4407
02:39:51,150 --> 02:39:52,030
I can't afford it yet.

4408
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:56,130
What the fuck is going on?

4409
02:39:56,390 --> 02:39:57,550
I don't...

4410
02:39:57,550 --> 02:39:58,230
What...

4411
02:39:58,230 --> 02:39:59,290
What is going...

4412
02:39:59,290 --> 02:40:00,410
What is...

4413
02:40:00,410 --> 02:40:02,110
What is going on?

4414
02:40:02,350 --> 02:40:03,530
I can't...

4415
02:40:03,530 --> 02:40:05,630
I don't know what's going on right now.

4416
02:40:07,590 --> 02:40:09,350
There's so many helicopters.

4417
02:40:10,430 --> 02:40:12,030
How much XP do I have?

4418
02:40:15,370 --> 02:40:16,570
There's just so much.

4419
02:40:17,090 --> 02:40:17,650
Money.

4420
02:40:18,090 --> 02:40:18,310
Ow.

4421
02:40:19,430 --> 02:40:21,010
What is even...

4422
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:22,130
What is happening?

4423
02:40:22,410 --> 02:40:26,090
It's just like little insects going back and forth right now.

4424
02:40:27,570 --> 02:40:28,130
Money!

4425
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:29,910
What's this?

4426
02:40:31,010 --> 02:40:32,070
What am I doing?

4427
02:40:32,270 --> 02:40:32,730
Oh my God.

4428
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:33,850
I don't know what...

4429
02:40:33,850 --> 02:40:34,170
I don't...

4430
02:40:34,170 --> 02:40:35,710
I don't know what's going on.

4431
02:40:36,270 --> 02:40:37,430
What are the helicopters?

4432
02:40:38,150 --> 02:40:38,710
Oh!

4433
02:40:40,670 --> 02:40:41,230
What...

4434
02:40:41,230 --> 02:40:42,170
What am I...

4435
02:40:42,170 --> 02:40:44,110
Did I kidnap my own monkeys?

4436
02:40:44,730 --> 02:40:45,450
What did I...

4437
02:40:47,630 --> 02:40:50,870
I don't know what these abilities are!

4438
02:40:51,230 --> 02:40:52,790
What did I upgrade?

4439
02:40:53,770 --> 02:40:53,950
What did I upgrade?

4440
02:40:53,950 --> 02:40:56,390
Deploys a powerful special...

4441
02:40:56,390 --> 02:40:57,330
Oh my God!

4442
02:40:57,870 --> 02:40:59,730
I get a marine monkey!

4443
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:02,930
Oh my God!

4444
02:41:03,250 --> 02:41:07,020
I'm deploying the marine...

4445
02:41:07,020 --> 02:41:08,140
Get in here!

4446
02:41:11,020 --> 02:41:13,140
Oh, I can move my monkeys.

4447
02:41:13,820 --> 02:41:15,260
Oh, that's what it does.

4448
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:17,380
Alright.

4449
02:41:19,140 --> 02:41:21,120
I don't know where I'm pushing this.

4450
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:23,140
Don't worry, we're at 70 now.

4451
02:41:24,540 --> 02:41:26,240
I'm deploying the monkey.

4452
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:27,680
Get in there, private!

4453
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:30,680
Get in there, finish the job!

4454
02:41:32,520 --> 02:41:33,760
Select a tower.

4455
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:35,880
Guys...

4456
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:38,960
Guys, my mouse died.

4457
02:41:41,860 --> 02:41:43,260
Oh my god.

4458
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:47,040
There's so much stuff going on that my mouse died.

4459
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:48,860
Okay.

4460
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:50,640
Don't worry, my mouse is back here.

4461
02:41:51,080 --> 02:41:52,000
There's too much.

4462
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:54,640
I... Is everybody's PC okay?

4463
02:41:55,380 --> 02:42:00,560
Is... Is everybody... Yay, level up!

4464
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:03,660
Detecting too much bloons action.

4465
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:05,740
Is everybody...

4466
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:07,860
Is everyone's PC okay?

4467
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:14,800
I can't even... I can't... Oh my god.

4468
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:15,860
Where's my cursor?

4469
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:19,300
I... I don't know where my cursor is!

4470
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:22,260
Oh my... Okay, we're fine.

4471
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:24,400
Welcome to Blue Lake.

4472
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:27,680
But my pit rate is high.

4473
02:42:27,940 --> 02:42:29,640
We can go further.

4474
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:33,020
How is there more waves?

4475
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:35,960
Okay.

4476
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:37,220
Okay.

4477
02:42:37,220 --> 02:42:38,180
We can go further, guys.

4478
02:42:39,380 --> 02:42:40,680
They can't do anything.

4479
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:42,220
I think they're all dead, guys.

4480
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:44,820
They can't even get past this pathway.

4481
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:46,680
Like, literally...

4482
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:50,880
They can't even get past here.

4483
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:53,260
Guys, we don't need Super Monkey.

4484
02:42:53,740 --> 02:42:55,520
Super Monkey is a crutch.

4485
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:56,860
We don't need him.

4486
02:42:57,260 --> 02:43:00,900
He doesn't fit in my... In my Ice Monkey land.

4487
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:02,320
He doesn't even fit.

4488
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:05,520
Oh my god.

4489
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:07,820
I don't know where my cursor is anymore.

4490
02:43:08,380 --> 02:43:08,820
I...

4491
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:10,440
Where is it?

4492
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:15,480
Where's my... I... Okay, I found it on my other... Where's my cursor?

4493
02:43:17,400 --> 02:43:17,840
Where...

4494
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:23,260
Oh, there it is.

4495
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:23,880
I found it.

4496
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:24,480
It's right here.

4497
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:25,160
I found it.

4498
02:43:25,260 --> 02:43:26,060
He's right here, guys.

4499
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:28,680
He's gonna stay in the water for now.

4500
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:32,620
What happens when you cram into... You're about to find out...

4501
02:43:32,620 --> 02:43:34,520
I don't even know where anything is.

4502
02:43:34,700 --> 02:43:36,660
I can't find out about anything.

4503
02:43:37,260 --> 02:43:39,300
My screen is just off.

4504
02:43:39,820 --> 02:43:41,740
All fucking Ice Monkeys.

4505
02:43:45,420 --> 02:43:46,300
It's okay.

4506
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:47,740
I'm not weak.

4507
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:51,480
We don't need to change our crosshair.

4508
02:43:55,830 --> 02:43:56,910
We're almost there.

4509
02:43:57,270 --> 02:43:57,970
We're almost there.

4510
02:43:58,210 --> 02:43:59,050
We're almost at a hundred, guys.

4511
02:43:59,350 --> 02:43:59,710
We're all...

4512
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:00,650
We're gonna make it!

4513
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:04,790
Why are we not upgrading our mortar, guys?

4514
02:44:05,430 --> 02:44:06,630
Oh, now we are.

4515
02:44:07,690 --> 02:44:08,970
I was like...

4516
02:44:08,970 --> 02:44:10,190
I was like...

4517
02:44:10,190 --> 02:44:12,270
Guys, you have some baby mortars here.

4518
02:44:12,430 --> 02:44:14,010
Fucking upgrade that shit.

4519
02:44:14,270 --> 02:44:15,910
You can't afford it.

4520
02:44:16,570 --> 02:44:17,870
I know you can.

4521
02:44:18,150 --> 02:44:19,550
Or maybe because I...

4522
02:44:19,550 --> 02:44:21,370
Maybe I can afford it because I already...

4523
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:22,970
I used up all my money on...

4524
02:44:22,970 --> 02:44:25,170
On literally, like...

4525
02:44:26,770 --> 02:44:28,970
On my ice, so it wasn't that hard.

4526
02:44:31,550 --> 02:44:32,150
But...

4527
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:34,170
Where I'm freezing everything for us.

4528
02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:37,990
The cats play Toki.

4529
02:44:40,090 --> 02:44:42,070
Someone upgrade their mortars!

4530
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:42,550
There's...

4531
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:44,990
Yay!

4532
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:46,210
Wait, we did it?

4533
02:44:46,890 --> 02:44:47,370
Damn.

4534
02:44:47,650 --> 02:44:48,310
What did I get?

4535
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:49,050
I'm...

4536
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:50,910
I'm the master builder, guys.

4537
02:44:54,310 --> 02:44:55,450
I like how...

4538
02:44:55,450 --> 02:44:56,510
I was the...

4539
02:44:56,510 --> 02:44:58,890
Everybody else has two things...

4540
02:44:58,890 --> 02:45:00,350
And I have 25.

4541
02:45:01,190 --> 02:45:01,950
I...

4542
02:45:04,630 --> 02:45:06,050
I started it.

4543
02:45:08,490 --> 02:45:09,250
Yep.

4544
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:11,730
I started...

4545
02:45:12,070 --> 02:45:12,290
Hi.

4546
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:13,910
Nice.

4547
02:45:15,190 --> 02:45:16,010
Let's go.

4548
02:45:17,410 --> 02:45:18,350
We can do this.

4549
02:45:18,450 --> 02:45:19,670
We can make it to 100.

4550
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:20,830
I believe in us.

4551
02:45:21,110 --> 02:45:22,790
Guys, just upgrade your mortar!

4552
02:45:23,970 --> 02:45:25,070
Where's my cursor?

4553
02:45:25,590 --> 02:45:26,750
Where did it go?

4554
02:45:27,370 --> 02:45:28,610
Guys, I lost it again.

4555
02:45:28,950 --> 02:45:29,490
Oh, there it is.

4556
02:45:29,570 --> 02:45:30,170
I found it.

4557
02:45:30,970 --> 02:45:32,870
Guys, upgrade your mortar, guys!

4558
02:45:33,450 --> 02:45:34,750
I know you're here!

4559
02:45:34,850 --> 02:45:35,570
Upgrade him!

4560
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:38,990
Guys, hurry!

4561
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:46,760
Why did no one up at the bottom?

4562
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:47,940
Oh, wait.

4563
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:48,320
They're mine.

4564
02:45:48,380 --> 02:45:49,000
No, they're not!

4565
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:49,520
See?

4566
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:50,780
They're not mine.

4567
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:51,580
They're player 4.

4568
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:53,040
Whoever player 4 is.

4569
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:56,220
They're not mine.

4570
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:58,680
I know, because I only put out...

4571
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:02,640
Guys, I would know which one's mine, because I literally only put out two characters.

4572
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:06,100
Ice Monkey, and helicopters.

4573
02:46:06,780 --> 02:46:09,120
Can you gift him money?

4574
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:13,200
Um, he's gotta earn it, like the rest of us.

4575
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:25,820
Um, why would I give him money when he can earn it like the rest of us?

4576
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:26,600
What's your money?

4577
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:28,260
Like the...

4578
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:33,500
Tote.

4579
02:46:34,180 --> 02:46:34,220
That's dope.

4580
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:35,200
Oh, hey, um...

4581
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:36,720
All that I'm saying...

4582
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:41,440
The gaming icon gives them money?

4583
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:42,200
Which one?

4584
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:45,480
I don't know how to give them money.

4585
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:48,940
This?

4586
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:49,560
Oh!

4587
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:51,960
Who was it?

4588
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:53,700
Who needed money?

4589
02:46:55,820 --> 02:46:58,040
Not me, I have plenty of money.

4590
02:46:58,840 --> 02:46:59,780
Okay, this is player four.

4591
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:01,500
Who the fuck is player four?

4592
02:47:01,580 --> 02:47:02,800
Player four, use your money!

4593
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:08,240
Player four, you have enough money to spend it.

4594
02:47:09,500 --> 02:47:11,760
Look at that, look at him, he's so rich!

4595
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:15,320
Spend your money right now, player four!

4596
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:19,820
There we go, good job!

4597
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:23,580
Player two, player two is fine.

4598
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:25,420
He doesn't need money.

4599
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:27,620
He's fine, we can get...

4600
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:29,920
He's okay, guys.

4601
02:47:30,580 --> 02:47:31,560
See, look at him.

4602
02:47:33,140 --> 02:47:38,060
I guess I could give him a little bit of money, or...

4603
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:46,540
There we go.

4604
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:47,720
See, look at that.

4605
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:49,320
I gave him a little bit.

4606
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:50,240
There we go.

4607
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,460
Oh yeah, don't say I didn't do nothing for people.

4608
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:56,940
Jesus Christ, what's going on?

4609
02:47:57,220 --> 02:47:58,740
What's going on on my screen?

4610
02:47:59,140 --> 02:48:01,200
Okay, what does it look like when...

4611
02:48:03,980 --> 02:48:05,900
Okay, everything looks normal now.

4612
02:48:07,700 --> 02:48:08,260
Okay.

4613
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:10,800
Okay, that looks a lot better.

4614
02:48:11,940 --> 02:48:14,420
I have to actually see what's going on.

4615
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:17,840
Yeah, like, there was too much flashing lights.

4616
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:21,220
Get a submarine?

4617
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:21,880
What's that?

4618
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:25,140
Does it sound like something that can fly?

4619
02:48:27,100 --> 02:48:28,040
I don't know.

4620
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:29,360
That doesn't fly.

4621
02:48:32,140 --> 02:48:34,320
Okay, the bit rate's back.

4622
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:37,000
Oh my god, we're almost there.

4623
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:38,880
Guys, we're almost at 90!

4624
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:41,680
All right, we did it.

4625
02:48:43,640 --> 02:48:44,280
All right.

4626
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:47,300
Oh my god, guys, we're at round 90.

4627
02:48:47,420 --> 02:48:48,360
Guys, we're gonna make it!

4628
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:52,000
We're gonna make it to 100!

4629
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:54,480
Oh my god, 91.

4630
02:48:56,580 --> 02:48:58,900
Okay, don't worry, I'll send in...

4631
02:48:58,900 --> 02:49:00,420
I'll send in the troops.

4632
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,420
I'll send in the Marines!

4633
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:07,580
All right, everybody's fully upgraded, right?

4634
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:08,780
I think so.

4635
02:49:08,980 --> 02:49:10,580
Yeah, I upgraded everybody instantly.

4636
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:14,420
The lag is...

4637
02:49:14,420 --> 02:49:15,000
Yes, it's right.

4638
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:16,240
No, no, it's fine!

4639
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:19,480
It's fine, it's fine.

4640
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:20,540
Look, we're making it.

4641
02:49:21,150 --> 02:49:22,820
Look, I'm slowing everything down.

4642
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,580
See, look at that.

4643
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:26,120
They just instantly disappear.

4644
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:27,720
Look at that.

4645
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:32,100
They literally just disappear out of everywhere.

4646
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:34,140
I don't even know where they went.

4647
02:49:36,300 --> 02:49:37,500
Oh my god.

4648
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:41,160
Like, they die so fast, they just snap out of existence.

4649
02:49:42,260 --> 02:49:44,240
There's no way I can lose, guys.

4650
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:46,700
Look at all these abilities I have.

4651
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,780
It's so laggy!

4652
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,420
We have to make it to 100!

4653
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:56,340
There'll be five.

4654
02:49:57,680 --> 02:50:00,320
The moment we make it to 100, it's over.

4655
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:02,460
We're free!

4656
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:05,420
I hear ya.

4657
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:08,960
Don't worry, I have so many freezes.

4658
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:11,660
I don't know what they do, but look at it go.

4659
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:14,560
Look at it though, we're all dancing.

4660
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:20,160
95, 95, five more to go!

4661
02:50:22,180 --> 02:50:25,300
I need a 50-90 for this game.

4662
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:29,660
Guys, this is me turning the effects all the way down too, by the way.

4663
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:37,340
I don't know what it's gonna be like if the effects were all the way up.

4664
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:40,300
Alright, 96.

4665
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:42,040
We're almost there.

4666
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,520
I'm freezing everything.

4667
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:49,140
Oh my god, it's just all air balloons.

4668
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:51,400
It's just literally all air balloons.

4669
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:54,480
It's all...

4670
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:55,640
Oh, and they're dead.

4671
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,580
How do they die so fast?

4672
02:50:57,580 --> 02:50:59,020
I can barely see it.

4673
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:02,120
They just get snapped out of existence.

4674
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:05,860
Alright, nice.

4675
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,440
Alright, 97.

4676
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:11,220
Okay.

4677
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:14,300
97.

4678
02:51:16,680 --> 02:51:17,160
Alright.

4679
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:21,220
We freeze them.

4680
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:24,360
Oh, now he's dead?

4681
02:51:28,110 --> 02:51:29,230
Come on, keep freezing.

4682
02:51:29,710 --> 02:51:30,790
I'm freezing him!

4683
02:51:31,990 --> 02:51:33,410
I'm doing everything I can!

4684
02:51:33,670 --> 02:51:34,950
I'm still freezing him!

4685
02:51:36,690 --> 02:51:37,590
Oh my god!

4686
02:51:37,810 --> 02:51:38,350
Okay, don't worry.

4687
02:51:38,450 --> 02:51:39,690
He just instant dies from here.

4688
02:51:39,930 --> 02:51:41,130
Level 37, nice.

4689
02:51:42,930 --> 02:51:43,370
Alright.

4690
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:45,610
Oh, here it is.

4691
02:51:45,710 --> 02:51:46,590
Here's the run killer.

4692
02:51:48,290 --> 02:51:49,930
We're gonna make it, boys.

4693
02:51:50,950 --> 02:51:51,930
We're gonna make it!

4694
02:51:57,710 --> 02:51:59,010
We're gonna make it!

4695
02:51:59,350 --> 02:52:00,370
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

4696
02:52:02,450 --> 02:52:03,550
Don't worry!

4697
02:52:04,450 --> 02:52:04,570
Don't worry!

4698
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:08,110
98 is nothing!

4699
02:52:09,250 --> 02:52:11,690
I'm setting men down right now!

4700
02:52:12,410 --> 02:52:13,850
My men are coming down!

4701
02:52:16,950 --> 02:52:17,950
There we go!

4702
02:52:19,270 --> 02:52:19,690
Oh!

4703
02:52:20,030 --> 02:52:20,850
And they're dead.

4704
02:52:21,450 --> 02:52:21,690
See?

4705
02:52:21,810 --> 02:52:22,390
I told you!

4706
02:52:23,250 --> 02:52:23,450
Wait!

4707
02:52:23,830 --> 02:52:24,410
90...

4708
02:52:24,410 --> 02:52:26,430
98 was supposed to be hard?

4709
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:28,690
That was so easy!

4710
02:52:29,370 --> 02:52:30,410
Look at that!

4711
02:52:32,210 --> 02:52:34,110
What the fuck are you talking about?

4712
02:52:35,870 --> 02:52:37,370
It's big, slow...

4713
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:38,630
Okay, it's big airship time.

4714
02:52:39,430 --> 02:52:40,530
Oh my god!

4715
02:52:40,730 --> 02:52:41,330
There it is!

4716
02:52:42,350 --> 02:52:42,990
There it is!

4717
02:52:43,070 --> 02:52:44,090
You know what that means?

4718
02:52:45,150 --> 02:52:46,590
What does this look like?

4719
02:52:47,670 --> 02:52:48,990
Oh my god!

4720
02:52:51,290 --> 02:52:53,270
Okay, let's do...

4721
02:52:53,270 --> 02:52:55,470
Let's do five.

4722
02:53:00,710 --> 02:53:01,610
You know what?

4723
02:53:01,730 --> 02:53:02,870
No, that's like too much.

4724
02:53:03,090 --> 02:53:03,350
I have...

4725
02:53:03,350 --> 02:53:04,550
Let's just get rid...

4726
02:53:04,550 --> 02:53:05,910
I saw...

4727
02:53:05,910 --> 02:53:08,550
I saw it for one second and I was like...

4728
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:09,630
That's good enough.

4729
02:53:10,290 --> 02:53:12,330
That's good enough for me.

4730
02:53:15,250 --> 02:53:16,510
Wait, we did it!

4731
02:53:16,750 --> 02:53:17,390
That's it!

4732
02:53:19,150 --> 02:53:19,790
Yeah!

4733
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:25,430
We did it, everyone!

4734
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:30,660
Alright, goodbye guys.

4735
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:34,020
Now that we beat 100...

4736
02:53:34,020 --> 02:53:34,940
07...

4737
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:36,220
07 to the crew.

4738
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:37,600
We did it.

4739
02:53:37,880 --> 02:53:38,520
Easiest...

4740
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:39,140
I told you.

4741
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:40,660
Ice monkey build was it.

4742
02:53:43,900 --> 02:53:45,900
I told you that was the biz.

4743
02:53:46,740 --> 02:53:47,240
We did it.

4744
02:53:47,400 --> 02:53:48,360
All us guys.

4745
02:53:48,820 --> 02:53:50,080
No extra help needed.

4746
02:53:50,540 --> 02:53:50,760
No!

4747
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:51,140
No!

4748
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:51,920
Hahaha!

4749
02:53:52,920 --> 02:53:55,420
We carried this entire crew ourselves.

4750
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:57,140
Look at that.

4751
02:53:57,980 --> 02:53:59,640
You're welcome, everybody.

4752
02:54:00,500 --> 02:54:01,520
You're welcome.

4753
02:54:02,480 --> 02:54:05,180
I couldn't have done it without ice monkey.

4754
02:54:05,620 --> 02:54:06,220
I...

4755
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:06,600
Hahaha!

4756
02:54:08,380 --> 02:54:09,560
GG, everyone!

4757
02:54:10,300 --> 02:54:10,940
GG!

4758
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:11,740
Hahaha!

4759
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:15,640
We were so good.

4760
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:16,680
Wait, everybody left.

4761
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:17,460
Oh, shit!

4762
02:54:17,720 --> 02:54:18,140
The good...

4763
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:18,500
Hahaha!

4764
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:19,400
Wait!

4765
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:20,500
I gotta leave!

4766
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:22,620
I gotta leave before I die!

4767
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:23,380
I lose!

4768
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:24,660
I got...

4769
02:54:24,660 --> 02:54:25,480
I got...

4770
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:25,740
I got...

4771
02:54:25,740 --> 02:54:26,760
I like how...

4772
02:54:26,760 --> 02:54:29,560
You can tell who left when everything was just gone.

4773
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:31,380
And I was like, wait a minute.

4774
02:54:31,380 --> 02:54:32,500
I'm starting to lose.

4775
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:33,240
What happened?

4776
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:34,700
Oh my...

4777
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:35,320
Oh my god.

4778
02:54:35,440 --> 02:54:36,380
Play for three...

4779
02:54:36,380 --> 02:54:37,280
Almost three hours.

4780
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:38,900
It did not feel like three hours.

4781
02:54:39,060 --> 02:54:40,720
I got too absorbed into...

4782
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:43,260
I can tell why this game is addicting now.

4783
02:54:43,780 --> 02:54:44,260
I...

4784
02:54:44,260 --> 02:54:44,580
Hahaha!

4785
02:54:45,780 --> 02:54:46,480
Oh man!

4786
02:54:46,540 --> 02:54:47,240
That was fun!

4787
02:54:47,240 --> 02:54:49,600
Hope you guys had fun watching me, uh...

4788
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:50,520
Play at Bloons.

4789
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:51,680
That was pretty addicting.

4790
02:54:52,060 --> 02:54:52,620
I can...

4791
02:54:52,620 --> 02:54:52,740
I...

4792
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:54,300
Seriously, I just passed by...

4793
02:54:55,280 --> 02:54:56,380
So fast, too.

4794
02:54:58,060 --> 02:54:58,460
Um...

4795
02:54:58,460 --> 02:55:00,520
Yeah, now I know why they made six of them.

4796
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:03,580
And why it was a very popular pay-to-win game on mobile.

4797
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:04,200
Hahaha!

4798
02:55:05,340 --> 02:55:07,560
But I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching.

4799
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:09,120
I do have another stream later today.

4800
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:09,800
Um...

4801
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:12,280
In an hour and a half with Girls Frontline, too.

4802
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:15,100
I saw a lot of people were actually really excited about it.

4803
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:15,720
Um...

4804
02:55:15,720 --> 02:55:18,160
I didn't realize how popular they were in general.

4805
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:21,600
Like, so many people were like, Oh, I don't watch Yoki, but I love Girls Frontline!

4806
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:22,920
I can't wait to check out the stream!

4807
02:55:23,160 --> 02:55:23,780
So yeah!

4808
02:55:23,780 --> 02:55:25,040
I'm super excited to check it out.

4809
02:55:25,100 --> 02:55:26,600
This will be my first time trying out the game.

4810
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:28,600
I have no knowledge of the game whatsoever.

4811
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:29,640
Um...

4812
02:55:29,640 --> 02:55:31,140
I just know it's like a gacha game.

4813
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:32,120
And that's really it.

4814
02:55:32,260 --> 02:55:34,080
So I'm looking forward to trying it out.

4815
02:55:34,480 --> 02:55:34,820
Uh...

4816
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:35,280
Anyway, guys.

4817
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:37,480
I'm gonna rest a little bit before my second stream.

4818
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:38,480
Um...

4819
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:39,680
As always, everybody.

4820
02:55:39,880 --> 02:55:40,840
Stay hydrated.

4821
02:55:41,060 --> 02:55:41,640
Posture check.

4822
02:55:41,820 --> 02:55:42,760
Get up and move around.

4823
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:44,140
You get that blood running.

4824
02:55:44,660 --> 02:55:45,060
Uh...

4825
02:55:45,060 --> 02:55:45,940
And you stay up for me.

4826
02:55:46,120 --> 02:55:46,900
Head to bed.

4827
02:55:47,100 --> 02:55:47,500
Cause...

4828
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,480
You deserve it.

4829
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:49,900
Or go to come and see the sponsor.

4830
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:50,980
As a, uh...

4831
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:51,400
Sponsor stream.

4832
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:53,200
I'm gonna raid the sponsor waiting room, too.

4833
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:54,080
Alright, everybody.

4834
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:54,920
Bye, guys!

4835
02:55:55,320 --> 02:55:55,720
Bye!
