1
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,760
Hello!

2
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,540
Hello everybody!

3
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,000
Hello!

4
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,860
Good morning!

5
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,360
Oh yeah, good morning to you guys.

6
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,800
It's like 8pm for me.

7
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,180
Good night to you, though.

8
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,840
Good morning!

9
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,820
Welcome to the girl squad.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,500
We are the top 500 girl squad.

11
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,160
Hiro is top 500 in our hearts.

12
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,720
In your hearts, yeah.

13
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,480
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,300
She's at least top 500 in my heart.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,460
Well, at least in your heart.

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,120
Most important, right?

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,100
Yeah, that's most important.

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,920
Exactly.

19
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,160
Yeah, yeah.

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
In Ditto's heart, too.

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,340
In Ditto's heart, you're like rank 500.

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,060
But in my heart, you're like top 10.

23
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,160
Wow, what a difference in treatment.

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,620
Yeah, Ditto.

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,080
That's so messed up.

26
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,860
Why is she only 500?

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,540
I didn't say that.

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,880
You didn't say no.

29
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,540
You didn't argue.

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,020
Oh my god.

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,880
You accept it.

32
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,240
You let me say it.

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,860
It's too late to say.

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,180
It's too late to defend yourself?

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,620
Oh my god.

36
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,880
That means I was right.

37
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,180
No, you're not.

38
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,860
You're not.

39
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,780
Friendship is never too late.

40
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,680
She's my top T.

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Top T.

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Wait, what am I?

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,280
You're a top 1000.

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,080
What?

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,680
You don't even have a thousand friends.

46
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
You don't even have a thousand friends.

47
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,380
That's...

48
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,280
That's so sad.

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,640
You don't even have a thousand friends.

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,240
I can't deny that.

51
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,340
I can't deny that.

52
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,760
Because I don't have... I don't have... I don't have a thousand friends.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah, then why am I...

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,080
I don't even have ten.

55
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,320
You don't even have ten, but on top of a thousand?

56
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,160
That's so fucked up.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,620
That's so...

58
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,540
That's because I played Power World with her recently.

59
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,780
I was supposed to be there, but I fell asleep.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,740
I fell asleep.

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,860
That's not fair.

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,300
I fell asleep.

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,900
It was my idea too.

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,740
I had to.

65
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,320
I had the idea to play...

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,780
Yeah, I was like...

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,880
Yeah, I was like, oh, where does she keep coming?

68
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,060
No, IGL, you're the highest rank.

69
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,220
What?

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,900
You're the highest rank.

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,180
We are all paid.

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,020
You're silver one.

73
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm silver three.

74
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,100
It's not that different from Super T.

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,580
It's two tiers different.

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,280
It was the same.

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,560
Oh my god.

78
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay, guys, how's the volume?

79
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,980
I don't know if Sound Guy's alive, so...

80
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,260
My other mod, it's your job to balance now.

81
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,660
My other mod has to balance.

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,200
Is that Predator Trail?

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,340
That's my Pred Trail.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,740
It's the legacy one.

85
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,180
Oh my god.

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,900
Please carry me.

87
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,100
It's the legacy trail.

88
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,920
Carry me.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,460
Carry me.

90
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,480
Carry me.

91
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,820
No, Silver One has...

92
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,340
You guys are...

93
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,820
Silver One has to carry.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,820
I have one RP right now.

95
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,180
Oh my god.

96
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah, and we have a Silver One player.

97
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,260
She's so good at this game.

98
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,180
Oh my god.

99
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,380
Oh my god.

100
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,200
She's Silver One.

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Ditto.

102
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,940
How did you get to Silver One?

103
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,360
I don't feel like I'm playing any base.

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,700
You don't feel like you're playing what?

105
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,940
What are you playing?

106
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,520
Oh my god.

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,080
Maybe I play too much CZZ.

108
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,460
You play too much CZZ?

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Oh my god.

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,980
Oh no, she can't aim anymore.

111
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,360
She can't aim.

112
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,060
Okay.

113
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,740
I...Okay.

114
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,780
You're washed.

115
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,140
I feel weird.

116
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,120
Honestly.

117
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,840
You too.

118
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,520
I feel weird.

119
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
Two games, two games.

120
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,720
We're washed, guys.

121
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,040
Guys, we used to be like the Apex girls!

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,640
Guys, we used to be like the Apex girls!

123
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,500
Guys, we used to be like the Apex girls in our country!

124
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:57,760
Guys, we used to be like the Apex girls!

125
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,240
What happened?

126
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,060
What happened to us?

127
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,120
Oh my god, my chat's not...

128
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,780
Okay.

129
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:06,920
Okay.

130
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,500
My chat's not showing.

131
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay.

132
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,600
You have autosprint on?

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,520
I do too.

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah.

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,520
Yeah.

136
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,440
Wait, what?

137
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,940
You guys have autosprint on?

138
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,660
Yeah, I'm lazy.

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,420
Yeah, that's the least.

140
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,200
Yeah.

141
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,920
I'm lazy.

142
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm lazy.

143
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't?

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
You're actually...

145
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,980
It's the first time I've heard you have autosprint on.

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,460
I've been autosprinting since season two.

147
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,960
Wow.

148
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,800
What a pro.

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
I know.

150
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm just lazy.

151
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,260
There's no reason to walk.

152
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,840
In rank, you don't walk.

153
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,160
You don't walk in rank.

154
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,880
You don't walk?

155
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,820
I walk.

156
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,020
We don't.

157
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,420
We don't.

158
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,140
Yeah, because you're always W keying.

159
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,620
You know?

160
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,400
You're always W keying.

161
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,600
If it's competitive, yeah, in competitive you have to walk.

162
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,160
Because you're sneaking up on people.

163
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,520
I walk right now.

164
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,860
In competitive, I don't walk.

165
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,500
You don't walk.

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,340
That's why we die.

167
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,500
Okay, I'm gonna walk the entire time then.

168
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,540
That's not your fault?

169
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,840
Yeah.

170
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,820
Alright, next week.

171
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,740
Isn't it... Don't you have a tournament next week?

172
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:13,920
No.

173
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,440
You guys... You guys die before I die.

174
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,940
Oh, okay.

175
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,240
Bet.

176
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
So that's not my fault.

177
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,240
Alright.

178
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,460
Here, you heard that?

179
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,340
She said we die before her.

180
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,960
You hear that?

181
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,660
Sad.

182
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,940
I'm lifelike.

183
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,020
That means somebody's not getting res.

184
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,600
Oh my god.

185
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
It's so... Yeah.

186
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
Pins, pins, pins.

187
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Yeah, please what?

188
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,060
Please don't die.

189
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,540
What do you mean?

190
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,340
I never die!

191
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,120
I'm lifelike.

192
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,820
We will see.

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,420
We will see.

194
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:43,720
We will see?

195
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,980
We will die first.

196
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
You're literally Pathfinder.

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,620
We will die first.

198
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,480
You're literally Pathfinder.

199
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
I like how we did not...

200
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,100
Oh wait.

201
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,440
What can you scan?

202
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,940
This is a people scanner, right?

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,220
Yeah.

204
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah.

205
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,840
Nothing is a rig scanner.

206
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,380
Okay.

207
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Alright.

208
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,900
Okay.

209
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,700
Guys, we're so washed.

210
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,220
I don't even remember.

211
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,100
I forgot how to open the map.

212
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,660
Okay.

213
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,040
Did you play too much C-C-C?

214
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,460
We can't counter...

215
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,440
I feel like Pathfinder is so slow.

216
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,120
Why is he moving so slow?

217
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,500
You picked Pathfinder.

218
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
What do you mean?

219
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,380
I feel like...

220
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,360
He moves really slow.

221
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,280
Are you sure you have auto run on?

222
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,840
Are you...

223
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,580
Yeah.

224
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,620
Are you on past 60 frames?

225
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,700
Are you...

226
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,320
Oh, look at me.

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,940
Look at me, look at me.

228
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,580
Is he wrong?

229
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,000
You're walking!

230
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,660
You're walking!

231
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,080
You're walking!

232
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,580
Oh, okay.

233
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay, I missed you.

234
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,420
Okay.

235
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,660
I don't know what happened.

236
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,480
Oh my god.

237
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,100
I need to up here.

238
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
I don't know what happened to you.

239
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,380
Wait, there's somebody here?

240
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,620
Oh no, guys, I need to raise up here.

241
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,420
Okay, I sound guy, raise up here.

242
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,340
Where is he?

243
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,040
Oh, he's over there.

244
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Okay, over there.

245
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,540
Okay, I knew it would be closer.

246
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,300
I can't...

247
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,320
Dina, how could you not tell you were walking?

248
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,860
How did you not see that?

249
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm gonna...

250
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,700
grab a package.

251
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,160
Dina, what happened?

252
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Dina, where...

253
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,240
He's hiding.

254
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,060
He's hiding.

255
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,820
Guys, guys, give me a sec, I'm looting.

256
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,940
Give me a sec, I'm looting.

257
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,360
Okay, okay.

258
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,620
He's hiding.

259
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,360
Where?

260
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,320
Where is he hiding?

261
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,620
He's down here.

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,840
Oh, I see him.

263
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,940
Wait, let me revive her.

264
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,620
Razor, Razor, Razor.

265
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,860
Yeah, I'm hacking up to you.

266
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,280
Okay, you got Razor here.

267
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,560
You got instant rez, remember, you're crypto.

268
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,440
Wait, they're like pushing me.

269
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,320
It's okay, just Razor.

270
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,260
Okay, it's okay, we'll use her as bait and then she can die again.

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,520
It's okay.

272
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,040
Doki can do 1v2.

273
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,360
Doki can do 1v2.

274
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
They're running away, I can do 1v3.

275
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,300
Why?

276
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,000
Why?

277
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,260
They ran away after killing you.

278
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,900
They caught me.

279
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,480
They caught me and they ran away.

280
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,140
There's another team.

281
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,660
Okay, we can go to it.

282
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm going left side.

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,660
I'll gamma to A-Scope and I'll follow you guys.

284
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,960
Ditto, what happened?

286
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,600
You died first.

287
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,220
Ditto.

288
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,380
No, Doki.

289
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,000
They were hiding.

290
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
He was hiding.

291
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
I don't know.

292
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,460
Did you see a hero?

293
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,400
Was he hiding?

294
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,980
Well, I think they're scaring.

295
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I think those are excuses.

296
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,040
I think those are excuses.

297
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,660
It's okay.

298
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,540
It's because she was walking.

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
Honestly, you're right.

301
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,440
You're right.

302
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,620
I can't walk.

303
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,780
It's okay.

304
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,760
Ditto, it's okay.

305
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,080
It's okay to die first.

306
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,180
We know every Pred player makes mistakes.

307
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,100
No, no, no.

308
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, you don't make mistakes?

309
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,140
No.

310
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,980
I don't because I'm the best player.

311
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,040
Oh, it depends on your IGL.

312
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,500
Yeah.

313
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,680
Alright, IGL.

314
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,020
What do you want to do?

315
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,260
What should we do, IGL?

316
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,160
Okay, we go.

317
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,020
We go landslide.

318
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm behind you.

319
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,380
Okay, look, give me battery.

320
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,380
Give you battery?

321
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,820
Okay.

322
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,420
Here.

323
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,440
Okay, nice.

324
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,340
Let's go.

325
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,660
Even I don't have a battery.

326
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,620
I had two.

327
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,180
You could have.

328
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,880
You should have asked.

329
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,920
I had two.

330
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:41,960
It's okay.

331
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,740
Wait, how did Ditto know I had battery?

332
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,160
I don't know.

333
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,740
I don't know.

334
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,900
I just asked you.

335
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,720
Oh my gosh.

336
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,160
She has...

337
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,500
She has inventory walls.

338
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,340
Oh my gosh.

339
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:55,600
She's...

340
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:55,940
She's cheating.

341
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,220
She has walls.

342
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
You can only look at...

343
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,680
Kayla, do you want battery?

344
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,960
I brought up the game volume a little bit.

345
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,480
Sound guy.

346
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,880
Follow me.

347
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,500
Follow me.

348
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,980
We're following.

349
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,540
We're following.

350
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,900
Wait, they're actually there.

351
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,260
We go here.

352
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:16,820
We go here.

353
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,300
We go here.

354
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,680
There's a team in front of me.

355
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,300
It's okay.

356
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
I will cover you guys.

357
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,040
Guys.

358
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,860
Guys.

359
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,460
I fucked up.

360
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,720
I broke his armor.

361
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,800
Yeah, I broke one armor.

362
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,660
I broke my armor too.

363
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,100
That one's low.

364
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,580
Okay.

365
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,760
Almost okay.

366
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,180
There's two teams.

367
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,640
Two teams.

368
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm backing to you.

369
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,460
I'm backing to you.

370
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,760
Last one.

371
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,280
Wait.

372
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,700
I'll EMP them.

373
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,040
Oh my gosh.

374
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
They're all split up.

375
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,740
They're all split up.

376
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,560
We're fine.

377
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,120
Okay.

378
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,720
We gotta go to zone.

379
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,200
We gotta go.

380
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,720
Believe me.

381
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,860

They're so low.

920
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,880
They're so low.

921
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,280
They're all low, they're all low.

922
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,700
I hit them even though I was distracted.

923
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,100
They're so low, you can't lose this.

924
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,560
They're bad.

925
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,780
Oh my god.

926
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,940
I don't know, I think we're gamers, guys.

927
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,640
That was our first round.

928
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,720
Yeah, that was our first game.

929
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,260
Guys, I helped you guys with the last team.

930
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,880
You're just, you're baiting.

931
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,300
It's okay.

932
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,180

Yeah, I was the meat shield.

934
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,980
I was the meat shield.

935
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,180
Look at us!

936
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,300
Oh my god, we got 20 kills together.

937
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,300
That's crazy.

938
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:47,940
Oh, yeah.

939
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,920
We can just requeue here.

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,740
Yeah, we don't have to go back.

941
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,340
Yeah, we don't have to go back.

942
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,200
Oh my god.

943
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,600
Someone in my chat was like, Wow, you guys can get, you guys might be able to get gold.

944
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,900
Really?

945
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,860
Do you think we're good enough for gold?

946
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,680
Oh my god.

947
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,680
They think we're good enough for gold.

948
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm gonna get out of here.

949
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,300
I've never been gold before.

950
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,500
Oh my god.

951
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,340
But, dude, you have pets.

952
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,340
No, no, no, I'm not.

953
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,420
I'm silver 2.

954
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,520
I'm silver 3.

955
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

956
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:27,900
No.

957
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm just a baby.

958
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,960
Once you have pets, always pets.

959
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,920
No, that's not.

960
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm not.

961
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,620
That's not.

962
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,400
Ditto, you literally started, you didn't know what was walk and run.

963
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,560
You're a more recent friend than me.

964
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,600
Why is Pathfinder so heavy?

965
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,020
Why is Pathfinder so heavy?

966
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,780
Why is Pathfinder so heavy?

967
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,420
Why is Pathfinder so heavy?

968
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,880
You were walking for like half, like 30% of that game.

969
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,360
You were walking for like half, like 30% of that game.

970
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,140
We got out of, we got out of climatizer and you were still walking.

971
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,460
Oh my god.

972
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,120
Oh my god.

973
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,780
I missed the same thing.

974
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,840
Yeah, and you were preyed.

975
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,820
Ditto, what happened?

976
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,400
No, I I play too much other games.

977
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,680
But I play other games.

978
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:25,920
But I play other games.

979
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,280
Yeah, I play other games too.

980
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,300
I knew I was running.

981
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
No, I haven't been playing baseball for a while.

982
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,620
Almost one month.

983
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna...

984
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't believe that.

985
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,360
I don't believe that.

986
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,620
I'm gonna look at her VODs right now.

987
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,060
Only one week.

988
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,560
I mean one week.

989
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,100
One week.

990
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,460
One or two.

991
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,660
Four days.

992
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,900
What do you mean?

993
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,020
No.

994
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,200
I play only one game.

995
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,680
I play one game and my internet is dead.

996
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,640
Five days ago you still streamed Apex.

997
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,700
Five days.

998
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,660
But that was only one game.

999
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,680
Four days and five days?

1000
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,420
Oh, so that's two games and two days.

1001
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,640
Yeah, two games.

1002
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,340
Two games?

1003
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,940
Yeah, so you play more.

1004
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,120
One game a day.

1005
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,740
One game a day.

1006
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,180
One game a day.

1007
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,360
Wow.

1008
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,220
And yet you still don't know if you're running or walking.

1009
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,360
No.

1010
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,700
Ditto.

1011
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,440
Ditto.

1012
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,220
What happened, Ditto?

1013
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
What happened to you?

1014
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,900
My aim is still good.

1015
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,800
That's why.

1016
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,360
This is so nice.

1017
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,300
There's a wingie.

1018
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,900
Your aim is still good.

1019
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,200
Ditto, if your aim is still good, pick up the wingman.

1020
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
Oh, okay, okay.

1021
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,880
Wait, really?

1022
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,560
She said her aim is still great, so she should pick up the wingman.

1023
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,320
Yeah.

1024
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,460
Okay, I will use the wingman.

1025
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,080
Ditto, do you think Ditto is going to hit her shots?

1026
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,060
Well...

1027
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,800
I believe.

1028
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,480
I believe.

1029
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,440
You know what I'll say?

1030
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,420
She believes me.

1031
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,360
There's no one who believes you, Ditto.

1032
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,980
Ditto, if you get most damage, most kills, I'll give you five subs.

1033
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,220
Wow.

1034
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,100
Only wingman.

1035
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,180
Only wingman.

1036
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,940
Only wingman.

1037
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,040
Your inventory has to be two wingmans.

1038
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,760
Okay, two wingmans.

1039
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,320
Okay, find me another wingman.

1040
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:35,820
Yeah, yeah.

1041
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:46,480
If Hiro and I, if Hiro and I, either of us, does more kills and damage than you, you have to give us five.

1042
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:53,260
Hiro, Hiro, you don't have to help Doki just list the two diapers.

1043
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,360
Here, you have to kill people too.

1044
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,880
You have to shoot people as well.

1045
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,840
I'll scan them.

1046
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,440
Don't worry.

1047
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,940
I'll be helping.

1048
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,560
I'll have zero damage.

1049
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,720
I'm just scanning them.

1050
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,640
Alright.

1051
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,520
We need to find another...

1052
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,800
We need to find one more wingman.

1053
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,020
Not yet.

1054
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,860
Not yet.

1055
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,240
We need to find one more wingman for...

1056
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,560
Wait, I scanned them?

1057
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:24,860
What?

1058
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,780
Oh, where?

1059
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,800
Where did you scan them?

1060
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,040
I don't know.

1061
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,820
I can find wingman.

1062
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,840
Where's wingman?

1063
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,720
Where's another wingman?

1064
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,120
We need another wingman for Ditto.

1065
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,380
Guys, we can't fight yet until Ditto has two wingmans.

1066
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,660
Guys, we can't fight yet until Ditto has two wingmans.

1067
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,620
You know Mozambique?

1068
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,200
You know Mozambique?

1069
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,680
Oh my god, wingman is too weak.

1070
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,240
Oh my god, wingman is too weak.

1071
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,320
It has only six bullets.

1072
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,240
Yeah, but then if you have two, you can't kill them.

1073
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,140
If you have two wingmans, then you have twelve bullets.

1074
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,560
Okay, okay.

1075
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah.

1076
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,800
Just remember, two wingmans, twelve bullets.

1077
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,600
It's okay.

1078
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,480
I can kill them with two bullets.

1079
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,080
Yeah.

1080
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,120
I believe in you.

1081
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,740
Yeah, you said your aim is so good today.

1082
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,420
Right?

1083
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,280
Oh, yeah.

1084
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,780
You used to be the wingman queen.

1085
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,580
Remember?

1086
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,940
Okay, okay.

1087
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,580
Is that a nickname?

1088
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,800
Yeah, when we first collabed...

1089
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,100
When we first collabed, her entire thing was about wingman.

1090
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,960
Really?

1091
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,600
Yeah, she was known for...

1092
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,400
Yeah, don't remember?

1093
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,580
I don't remember.

1094
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,820
He doesn't remember?

1095
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,040
Did I say that?

1096
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,080
Yeah, you used to be like...

1097
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,440
People would be like, oh my god, Ditto and wingman.

1098
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,020
Back then.

1099
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,600
And you would always play wingman.

1100
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,100
Yeah, remember?

1101
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,460
It was like three years ago.

1102
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,820
You would always play wingman.

1103
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,140
Did you misunderstand me with someone?

1104
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,360
No.

1105
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
No, I'm pretty sure.

1106
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,660
I am pretty sure.

1107
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,040
I can't remember.

1108
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,120
When did I say that?

1109
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,800
What do you mean when?

1110
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,420
Back then when you first got prepped.

1111
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,780
Back then when you first got prepped.

1112
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,960
You would always hold on to the wingman.

1113
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,060
You would always hold on to the wingman.

1114
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,040
Oh my god, she doesn't remember.

1115
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Oh my god, she doesn't remember.

1116
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,640
She's getting old.

1117
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,180
She's getting old.

1118
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,040
No, you...

1119
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,320
No, no, you're gaslighting me.

1120
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,240
I can literally...

1121
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,620
I can literally...

1122
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,700
Look at your channel.

1123
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,300
Really?

1124
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,200
Yeah!

1125
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,620
I pushed your clips.

1126
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,400
I think...

1127
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,780
I have been playing SMG and Assault Ivan.

1128
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,480
I think she's gaslighting us.

1129
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,220
No, you!

1130
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,540
You're the one.

1131
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,480
No, no, no, you're gaslighting us.

1132
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:41,900
Oh my god.

1133
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,260
You used to pick up the wingman all the time.

1134
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,120
Your old age is getting to you.

1135
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,240
You're getting old, Ditto.

1136
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,600
No!

1137
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
She's gonna be like...

1138
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,460
Only 17.

1139
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,780
Only 17.

1140
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,500
Grandma Ditto.

1141
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,820
Oh my god.

1142
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,660
Oh my god, grandma.

1143
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,980
If I were a grandma, you might be older than grandma.

1144
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,240
Oh, I'm older?

1145
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,780
No, no, no, no.

1146
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,100
Wait, wait, wait.

1147
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,500
Is this that enemy?

1148
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,660
Is that enemy?

1149
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,920
Let me check for you.

1150
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,740
Don't worry, Hiro.

1151
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,680
You can check for us.

1152
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,580
So far, it is an enemy.

1153
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
Yeah, that is an enemy.

1154
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,760
If you find another wingman, ping me.

1155
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,740
Okay, don't worry.

1156
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,040
We will.

1157
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,960
I wanna have luck.

1158
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,720
Oh my god, Ditto is a hag.

1159
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,680
Wait, Loba is running.

1160
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,020
Oh my god, maybe they're gonna be like...

1161
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,480
Wait, I have 0 damage.

1162
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,860
I'm gonna scan for you.

1163
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,460
Hiro, no!

1164
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,840
You need help!

1165
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,100
At least get the evil harvester, Hiro.

1166
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,900
Get the evil harvester.

1167
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,260
Okay.

1168
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,400
I can't get it with my drone.

1169
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,940
You can?

1170
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,860
I thought you...

1171
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,320
Oh no.

1172
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,060
They have 2 parties.

1173
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,620
2 or 4.

1174
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,300
You did damage!

1175
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,540
No, 0.

1176
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,820
Oh my god.

1177
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,420
45, 45, 45.

1178
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,160
Okay, I can't do anything.

1179
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,100
Blue armor, blue armor.

1180
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Okay, 90, 90.

1181
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,560
Are you making up numbers?

1182
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,160
I don't think she's hitting them.

1183
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,800
I think she's making it up.

1184
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,080
Over there, over there, over there.

1185
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,140
We have to back out.

1186
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,900
I think that...

1187
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,720
There are so many people here.

1188
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
There's too many, we have to go around.

1189
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,720
Why are they focusing us?

1190
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,500
I know, why are they focusing us?

1191
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm backing out.

1192
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,120
I think we should go there.

1193
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,920
Okay.

1194
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,400
I'm here.

1195
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,040
I hit landslide.

1196
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,700
Goodbye, guys.

1197
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,860
Goodbye.

1198
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,140
Lito, stop making up that...

1199
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,600
Like when you hit shots, stop pretending you hit them.

1200
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,520
Lito, you don't have to pretend, Lito.

1201
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,100
I hit them, I hit them.

1202
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,800
You can't see my...

1203
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,300
You're like, I'm getting gaslit from both of you.

1204
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,000
No, I believe.

1205
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,040
Hiro, Hiro.

1206
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,200
Hiro, Hiro.

1207
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,260
Hiro, in your drone, did you hear...

1208
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,060
Did you see her hit them?

1209
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,280
Doki is a gaslighting queen.

1210
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,860
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1211
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,660
She always gaslighting people.

1212
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,600
That is not true.

1213
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,620
I would never gaslight people.

1214
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,660
That's true, that's true.

1215
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm gonna grab this triple take and then steal your damage.

1216
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm gonna grab this triple take and then steal your damage.

1217
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,960
I have...

1218
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,820
Oh my god.

1219
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,920
And then grab it.

1220
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,900
Oh, wait, yeah.

1221
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,080
Oh, okay.

1222
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,640
Let me know if you guys find...

1223
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,360
Let me know if you guys find...

1224
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,900
If you guys find a sniper, let me know.

1225
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,580
I need one more wingman.

1226
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,460
I can find another wingman.

1227
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,700
It's okay, we'll find...

1228
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,000
We'll find more wingmans for you, don't worry.

1229
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,140
I'll find... yeah.

1230
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,540
I'll try to find one here.

1231
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,180
Oh my gosh.

1232
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,900
Maybe there is one.

1233
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,720
There has to be at least one, right?

1234
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,720
Oh, I hear shots.

1235
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,420
Okay.

1236
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,920
Still there.

1237
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,660
Oh, you found it?

1238
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,100
You found it?

1239
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,040
Really?

1240
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,480
No, no.

1241
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,100
Not yet.

1242
00:30:59,460 --> 00:30:59,940
Oh, no.

1243
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,240
I just got the red armor.

1244
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,320
Oh my god.

1245
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,340
Oh my god, I'm so strong now.

1246
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,500
Yeah.

1247
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:10,900
Yeah.

1248
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,660
You don't have to shoot.

1249
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,200
You don't have to shoot.

1250
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,080
You already did 2,000 damage.

1251
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,360
Yeah, guys.

1252
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,080
I already did 2,000 damage.

1253
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,480
Guys.

1254
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,980
I did 4,000 damage for this red armor.

1255
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,320
Wait, there is actually somebody.

1256
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:24,600
Oh, one squad.

1257
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,260
Oh.

1258
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,040
Wait, where is it?

1259
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,600
Oh my god.

1260
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Wait, in front of us?

1261
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:30,940
Maybe?

1262
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,320
Yeah.

1263
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,740
Wait, let me look.

1264
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,500
There are two squads.

1265
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,760
Two squads.

1266
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,220
No, no.

1267
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,620
They are not.

1268
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,420
No, no, no.

1269
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,280
Maybe they are on the left.

1270
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

1271
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,240
Here.

1272
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,280
Here.

1273
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,400
Here.

1274
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,780
Yeah.

1275
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,940
I hear this way.

1276
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,620
Okay, you go first.

1277
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
Oh, so I could die first.

1278
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,000
Is that it?

1279
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,300
No, I'm covering you.

1280
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,060
Why are you talking?

1281
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,060
You know what?

1282
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,620
Why are you talking?

1283
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,540
I'm doing this.

1284
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,120
I don't see them.

1285
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,540
Oh, I see them.

1286
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,300
They are on the left.

1287
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,100
Oh.

1288
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,260
I'm flying to there.

1289
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,360
Alright, I'm going to get to the high ground here.

1290
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,140
What?

1291
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,640
You're joking?

1292
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm going here.

1293
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:08,980
What?

1294
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:09,960
Where are you?

1295
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,420
He was right in front of me.

1296
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,580
Wait, we are both not there, Doki.

1297
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,640
What the f**k?

1298
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,140
Why did you guys...

1299
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,400
What?

1300
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,220
Why are you sleeping?

1301
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,220
They are right here.

1302
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,080
They are right here in front of me.

1303
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,580
Hey, hey, hey.

1304
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,360
Let me EMP them for you.

1305
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,080
Wait, I can't.

1306
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,500
I can't.

1307
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,480
I cracked one.

1308
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,840
I cracked one.

1309
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,500
Oh my god.

1310
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,720
I cracked the Bangalore.

1311
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,120
They have two.

1312
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,760
They have two.

1313
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,220
They have two.

1314
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay.

1315
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,040
I'm coming over.

1316
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,460
I'm coming over.

1317
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,240
Should I shock them again?

1318
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,660
Oh my god.

1319
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,440
Hiro is doing damage.

1320
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,940
Hiro is doing damage right now.

1321
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,120
I almost cracked one.

1322
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,100
Okay, okay.

1323
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,780
I'm going behind.

1324
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,340
I'm going behind.

1325
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,940
Hiro, we need your help.

1326
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,220
Hiro.

1327
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,380
You got this.

1328
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,640
No, I don't.

1329
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,120
No, I don't.

1330
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,700
Hiro, come here.

1331
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:46,940
Hiro.

1332
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,360
Wait, calm down, Doki.

1333
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,240
Enough one.

1334
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,780
Enough one.

1335
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,480
Nice, nice, nice.

1336
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:51,940
I'm batting.

1337
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,420
I'm batting.

1338
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,100
Actually, I'm going to thirst him then.

1339
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
I'm getting his armor.

1340
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,440
He has a bow.

1341
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,500
Go, go, go, go, go.

1342
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,280
Where?

1343
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,200
With me.

1344
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,460
With me.

1345
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:06,720
Whoa.

1346
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,160
I got one.

1347
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,480
I got one.

1348
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,860
Okay, nice.

1349
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,740
Another one.

1350
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,380
This is the last guy.

1351
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:12,580
This is the last guy.

1352
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,380
Okay, let me.

1353
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,100
Let me.

1354
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,540
Let me.

1355
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:14,900
Here.

1356
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:15,860
What?

1357
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,000
Wait, I'll rest you.

1358
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,520
I'll rest you.

1359
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,420
Wait, there's actually someone else?

1360
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,360
What is the point of playing live like this?

1361
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,700
I'm going to die.

1362
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,420
Get him.

1363
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,580
Get him.

1364
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,480
I have gold breath.

1365
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:32,900
I have gold breath.

1366
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,100
Okay, so.

1367
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,560
I also have it.

1368
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,480
Oh, okay.

1369
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,320
Okay, I give you a joke.

1370
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,320
Okay, I'm going to die first.

1371
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:38,820
Okay.

1372
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,140
Raise me.

1373
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,780
Raise me.

1374
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,580
Wait, it's so painful.

1375
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,000
Cover.

1376
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Cover.

1377
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,340
Cover.

1378
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,520
Cover.

1379
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,800
I cracked.

1380
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,440
I cracked the Loba.

1381
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:46,880
Oh.

1382
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,280
Wait.

1383
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,240
Oh, shit.

1384
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,740
He's low.

1385
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,700
Okay, slow.

1386
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,360
Okay, slow.

1387
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,120
Guys, wait.

1388
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:54,840
No.

1389
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,240
She's.

1390
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,300
She's toying.

1391
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,040
She's toying.

1392
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,460
Kill him.

1393
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:58,980
Kill him.

1394
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,640
Run away.

1395
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,020
Run away.

1396
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,200
Another team.

1397
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,720
Another team.

1398
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,320
Another team.

1399
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,460
Another team.

1400
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,840
Yeah.

1401
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,700
Another team is shooting me from ten miles away by the way.

1402
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,580
I got the most damage by the way.

1403
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,860
Thank God.

1404
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,820
Yes, I got the most damage.

1405
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,580
Did you just raise me?

1406
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,680
Did you just raise me?

1407
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,560
I was going to.

1408
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,760
I had to get armor.

1409
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,420
I had to refresh my armor.

1410
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,160
Oh, God.

1411
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,320
What do you mean?

1412
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,300
I did rez you.

1413
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,620
Secretly just because we wanted the damage?

1414
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,760
Secretly just because we wanted the damage?

1415
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,780
She would just knife me and gain only damage.

1416
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,460
That's not true.

1417
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,160
That is not true.

1418
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,060
That's not true.

1419
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,120
I knock people if I had to.

1420
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,180
Oh, my God.

1421
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,160
I got Daisy.

1422
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,240
You want me?

1423
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,640
Did you raise Quinch?

1424
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,740
She is not here.

1425
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,560
Oh, wait.

1426
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,260
You want me?

1427
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,140
I can shine.

1428
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,980
She actually raised Quinch.

1429
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,680
No.

1430
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,060
No, I can't.

1431
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,320
Didn't you hear me?

1432
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,840
I said I got Daisy.

1433
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,760
You got D-C.

1434
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:15,940
Yeah.

1435
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
I got disconnected.

1436
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,100
Yeah, disconnect.

1437
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah,

1438
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,320
did a disconnect.

1439
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,020
I got disconnected.

1440
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,580
I got disconnected.

1441
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,480
I got disconnected.

1442
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,740
What happened to your...

1443
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,880
Okay, double or nothing.

1444
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,780
We can double it.

1445
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,260
If you have more damage on Wingman, 10 subs.

1446
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,320
If you have more damage on Wingman, 10 subs.

1447
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,640
10 subs.

1448
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Okay.

1449
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,620
I only had one Wingman.

1450
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,340
That's not my fault.

1451
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,340
I will fight you.

1452
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,600
I will fight you.

1453
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,000
You don't help me finding my Wingman.

1454
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
I found you the first Wingman.

1455
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,980
What do you mean?

1456
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,340
Hiro didn't find you the second Wingman.

1457
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:03,960
Here.

1458
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Here.

1459
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,120
Oh, God.

1460
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,480
Now you get everything.

1461
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,160
Yeah.

1462
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,660
Now you can't complain.

1463
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,760
You can't complain anymore.

1464
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,280
Ditto.

1465
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,440
All right, double.

1466
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,520
Double if you get more damage than Hiro or I.

1467
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,920
Double.

1468
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,240
Double if you get more damage than Hiro or I.

1469
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,220
Double.

1470
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,460
I will get more damage this time.

1471
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,300
I will get more damage this time.

1472
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,040
Okay.

1473
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,580
I believe you.

1474
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,480
All right.

1475
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,040
Where do we land, Hiro?

1476
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,540
Ditto, where do we land?

1477
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,940
We're going to get rid of Dido.

1478
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,320
Land somewhere where you can get a wingman.

1479
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,820
Oh, okay.

1480
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,400
Maybe two teams.

1481
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,260
Oh, okay, okay.

1482
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,460
There's no teams here.

1483
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,760
Yeah.

1484
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,700
We can... we can...

1485
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,640
Dirt them?

1486
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1487
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,260
Then I'll just go here.

1488
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,080
Or I'll land here.

1489
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,980
We're so split.

1490
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,820
I can't believe Dido...

1491
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,180
I can't believe Dido rage quit.

1492
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,240
Oh my gosh.

1493
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,600
No, I said I got D.C.

1494
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,900
She's so angry.

1495
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,840
I got D.C.

1496
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,320
Yeah, yeah.

1497
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
D.C.

1498
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,320
Yeah.

1499
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,720
I got this blank then.

1500
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
It's M.

1501
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,540
Yeah, we believe you.

1502
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,620
We believe you, Dido.

1503
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,820
D.C.

1504
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah, of course.

1505
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,680
It had to be D.C.

1506
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,860
It's D.C.

1507
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,460
It's D.C.

1508
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,560
Of course.

1509
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,100
Yeah, yeah.

1510
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,580
D.C., D.C.

1511
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh my gosh.

1512
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,020
Okay.

1513
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,160
Next time we play with RPR, okay, I will help RPR.

1514
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,780
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1515
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,380
Wait, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1516
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,540
It is a D.C.

1517
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:11,760
IPR.

1518
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,280
I believe you.

1519
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,220
That was fun.

1520
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,620
No, we have to fight RPR together.

1521
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,060
I have not found a wingman yet.

1522
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,160
There's a wingman here, there's a wingman here.

1523
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,820
Oh, okay, nice.

1524
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,120
Where?

1525
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,440
Okay, I will go get it.

1526
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,360
Okay.

1527
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,860
Oh, they're flying.

1528
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,500
They're starting.

1529
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:36,740
They are?

1530
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,180
Okay.

1531
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,880
Yeah, just like flying.

1532
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,520
Wait, I don't have wingman.

1533
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,100
Yeah, go grab your wingman.

1534
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,540
Here.

1535
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,080
Okay.

1536
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,520
There's three wingmans.

1537
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,500
Oh, really?

1538
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:46,800
Oh my god.

1539
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,460
Yeah.

1540
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,420
Go grab it.

1541
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,320
Wait, why were you running to me, Ditto?

1542
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,580
Wait, whoa.

1543
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,760
Ditto was running to me.

1544
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,500
She thought I was Hiro.

1545
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,500
I saw her like next to me.

1546
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,340
I'm running to Hiro.

1547
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,540
No, I saw you running to me.

1548
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,980
I saw you at the bridge.

1549
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm so sad.

1550
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,500
Why was there a bridge?

1551
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,260
I can't believe it.

1552
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,260
I can't believe Ditto couldn't remember what Hiro looks like.

1553
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,020
Oh.

1554
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,780
I remember.

1555
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,220
I can't remember.

1556
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,760
You said I was your top three.

1557
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,480
Yeah, you were top three.

1558
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,120
Yeah, you were lying.

1559
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,600
It's not lying.

1560
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,720
Then why were you at the bridge?

1561
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,540
I was farming.

1562
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,520
Farming what?

1563
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,440
I was there.

1564
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,580
A wingman.

1565
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,500
Wingman.

1566
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,440
Okay.

1567
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:40,920
I'm ready.

1568
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,740
Wait, I found one.

1569
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,560
Nice.

1570
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,940
Oh, shit.

1571
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,660
You used the bomb.

1572
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,580
It's all over?

1573
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,880
Yeah.

1574
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,960
Okay, I have one.

1575
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,920
I have one wingman.

1576
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,120
You're supposed to have two.

1577
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,980
No, I got wingman and backpack.

1578
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,420
Oh, okay.

1579
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,320
So we need another wingman.

1580
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,340
Okay, other one.

1581
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,720
Other one is fine for now.

1582
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,360
They're so angry.

1583
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
Why are they angry?

1584
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,820
Why did you make them angry?

1585
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,380
Yeah, why did you make them angry?

1586
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,340
So that Ditto can go and kill everybody.

1587
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:19,940
Oh, true, true.

1588
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,420
Ditto, why aren't you here yet?

1589
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,040
Go, Ditto, the rest.

1590
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,580
Now's your chance.

1591
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,600
Yeah, now's your chance.

1592
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,520
I'm just gonna leave.

1593
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,360
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, here.

1594
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Oh my god, in front of me!

1595
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,360
I broke him.

1596
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,380
I broke him, Ditto.

1597
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,640
I'm batting, I'm batting.

1598
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,420
Wait, she's low?

1599
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,100
This one's low?

1600
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,760
Wait, on me.

1601
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,480
This one's low, Ditto.

1602
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,160
Can you crawl to me?

1603
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,480
Okay, I'm crawling.

1604
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,520
Okay, um, okay, come back.

1605
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,260
She's raising me.

1606
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,580
She's raising me.

1607
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,140
Alright.

1608
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,280
Okay, come back.

1609
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,120
Wait, what do you mean come back?

1610
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,580
You can do it, Ditto!

1611
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,900
I told you I can do it.

1612
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:01,900
I need you guys.

1613
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,420
Okay, let me finish him.

1614
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:05,940
I need heroes.

1615
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,820
No, no, no!

1616
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,220
I hope you get shot.

1617
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,660
I hope you get shot.

1618
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,860
Wait, she's here.

1619
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,020
She's right here.

1620
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,920
Okay, he's gonna run.

1621
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,160
I'm gonna loot.

1622
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,240
You guys...

1623
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,400
You kill him.

1624
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,680
You need this more than us.

1625
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,620
We're gonna loot.

1626
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,700
Wait,

1627
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,620
did you hear that?

1628
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,620
Wait, did you hear that?

1629
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,240
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1630
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,840
Wait, he's here!

1631
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,320
He's here!

1632
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,600
Oh my god!

1633
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,460
Only one!

1634
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,220
Ditto!

1635
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,580
Ditto!

1636
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,100
Ditto!

1637
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,200
Ditto!

1638
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,180
Only one!

1639
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,640
Only one!

1640
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,380
Only one damage!

1641
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,340
Ditto!

1642
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,400
Ditto, why did you leave us?

1643
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,480
He's damaged!

1644
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
He's...

1645
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,700
Ditto, he krapped us!

1646
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,900
Okay, okay, okay!

1647
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,380
Ditto craft us...

1648
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,900
and rez us...

1649
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,040
Okay, that was so... that was like...

1650
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,980
He just landed on us.

1651
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,200
Yeah, we were like, wait a minute... isn't that...

1652
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,740
Isn't that like a landing song?

1653
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,240
Yeah, is that landing?

1654
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,480
Is this the ending?

1655
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,160
Did somebody fall on us?

1656
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,680
I'm a Rezzy guy here.

1657
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,200
Yeah, it's okay.

1658
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,100
Rez is here.

1659
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,280
They're gonna loot.

1660
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,280
Yeah, you can 1v3.

1661
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:41,940
You want that 10 subs.

1662
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,960
Yeah, I can 1v2.

1663
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,380
Can't believe it.

1664
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,340
Ditto hates us.

1665
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,400
She left us to die.

1666
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,520
No!

1667
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,160
They're coming.

1668
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,920
They're there.

1669
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,580
Where are they?

1670
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,300
On the hill.

1671
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,260
On the hill?

1672
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,160
I didn't see them.

1673
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,800
Which one?

1674
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,600
Wait, let me think.

1675
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,900
Did you actually see them?

1676
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,640
Yes, I did actually.

1677
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,940
I see them.

1678
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,720
Over here.

1679
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,120
I hit one.

1680
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,440
Oh, she's in it.

1681
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,640
Oh, the vantage.

1682
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,060
Oh, there's one guy.

1683
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,880
Yeah, the vantage is looking at me.

1684
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,280
She's looking at me.

1685
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,860
I'm backing out.

1686
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,500
I'm backing out.

1687
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,480
I want Ditto to be closer to them.

1688
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,140
Alright, I'm going.

1689
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,340
They're too far.

1690
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,180
Yeah, they have to come to us.

1691
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,180
Do you wanna go loot?

1692
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,780
Yeah, let's get some loot.

1693
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,140
Yeah.

1694
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,200
I'm backing out.

1695
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,600
Wait, what?

1696
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,580
Behind is another team.

1697
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:42,620
Okay.

1698
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,460
I'll go first.

1699
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,440
Be careful.

1700
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:46,760
Be careful.

1701
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:46,960
Here.

1702
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,260
It's okay.

1703
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,540
We don't take more damage here.

1704
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,420
Yeah, we took less damage.

1705
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,060
Oh my god!

1706
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,560
Mirage!

1707
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:53,920
Mirage!

1708
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,780
Wait, why are there so many people?

1709
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,700
What do you mean, why is there... It's okay.

1710
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,320
He ran to them.

1711
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:00,880
He ran to the team.

1712
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,520
He ran to the team.

1713
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,980
In front of me!

1714
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:03,280
In front of me!

1715
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,940
In front of me!

1716
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,040
Oh, that's a lot.

1717
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,780
That's a lot of people.

1718
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,520
That's a lot of people.

1719
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,880
Is that a Mirage?

1720
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,320
On me.

1721
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,560
On me.

1722
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,740
On me.

1723
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:10,980
On me.

1724
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,360
That one?

1725
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,400
That one?

1726
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:13,820
That one?

1727
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,260
I got Ditto.

1728
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,580
I got Ditto.

1729
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,340
Wait, they're all dead.

1730
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,340
Oh my god!

1731
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,780
There's more.

1732
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,100
There's more.

1733
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,720
There's more.

1734
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,160
Okay.

1735
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:18,740
Yeah.

1736
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:19,780
Be careful.

1737
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1738
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,400
There's more behind us.

1739
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,860
There's more.

1740
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:22,920
Holy shit.

1741
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,160
Okay.

1742
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,200
I'm looting so much.

1743
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,480
Okay.

1744
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:24,920
Oh my god.

1745
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,440
Oh my god.

1746
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,680
Where the fuck did they come from?

1747
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:27,820
I'm looting.

1748
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,180
Got me.

1749
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,040
There was like people there, but they like ran away.

1750
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,260
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1751
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,900
Oh my god.

1752
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,100
They like showed up.

1753
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,380
Oh my god.

1754
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,140
They came out of nowhere.

1755
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,080
But they looted us.

1756
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:40,680
Yeah.

1757
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,560
They're so bad.

1758
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,080
Oh my god.

1759
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,860
They're so bad.

1760
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,420
You started it.

1761
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,180
You said they lost to us.

1762
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:54,580
No!

1763
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,460
I just said they lost to us, but that didn't mean that they are bad.

1764
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,060
Oh, they're not bad?

1765
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:00,860
Then what does it mean?

1766
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,140
Yeah.

1767
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,720
We obeyed them.

1768
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:04,960
True.

1769
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,360
They're not bad, but we just We're just better.

1770
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,240
We're just better.

1771
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,720
We should go to a zone.

1772
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,640
The other team ran away.

1773
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,820
I'm surprised.

1774
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah, they did.

1775
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,060
Yeah, they were so scared.

1776
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,900
Find me another wingman here.

1777
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:22,960
You're out.

1778
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,580
Okay.

1779
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,180
Okay.

1780
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,460
Go inside the zone first.

1781
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:29,960
Okay.

1782
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1783
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,440
I need that actually.

1784
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,520
I need too many medkits.

1785
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,800
I have like a... Oh, there's people in here.

1786
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,440
There's people in here.

1787
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:41,780
Okay.

1788
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1789
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,300
I saw a shot there.

1790
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,960
I don't have zipline.

1791
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,040
I don't know if they're in there, but I saw like a straight shot.

1792
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,720
So there was a fight close by.

1793
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,040
I think you can do an ult here because you found another wingman here.

1794
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,580
They're far.

1795
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,300
They're farther there.

1796
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,560
Yeah, do an ult here because there's a wingman here.

1797
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,080
I'm pretty sure.

1798
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,500
Okay.

1799
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,060
You sure?

1800
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1801
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,320
You know, you know, put ult down.

1802
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,840
Okay.

1803
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,600
So, they can do another wingman.

1804
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,160
Let me see.

1805
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,060
There's a team near by the way.

1806
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:09,920
Okay.

1807
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,280
Okay.

1808
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,240
No, you mad me.

1809
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,160
I'm not scared.

1810
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,940
They're like right above here, you know?

1811
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,100
I'm not scared.

1812
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:17,500
Really?

1813
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:18,660
Yeah.

1814
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,960
I'll put an ult down.

1815
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,500
Yeah, put the ult down.

1816
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,900
They're coming to us.

1817
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,600
They're coming to us.

1818
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,280
They're coming right here for the ult.

1819
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,300
Come here for your wingman before you fight them.

1820
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,720
Okay, okay, okay.

1821
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,380
Get your wingman.

1822
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,860
We can't fight.

1823
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,880
What about your wingman?

1824
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,060
No wingman.

1825
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:35,940
No wingman.

1826
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,500
Oh my god.

1827
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,580
Okay, but I got...

1828
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,120
Wait, this one, can we fight this one?

1829
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,120
Can we just kill this guy?

1830
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:41,560
Yeah, yeah.

1831
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,340
He's down there.

1832
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,700
Sure, where is he?

1833
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,280
I see one.

1834
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:46,880
Only one.

1835
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,100
Alright, let's go.

1836
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:48,760
Only one.

1837
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,520
Make a zip.

1838
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,200
Fight them.

1839
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,400
Okay.

1840
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,000
Okay.

1841
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,140
Yeah, yeah.

1842
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,460
I believe in the ditto power.

1843
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,400
That's why I zip.

1844
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:56,880
Ditto.

1845
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,060
Ditto.

1846
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,260
I think they... he ran away.

1847
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,560
Oh yeah, zone's...

1848
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,500
They don't see him.

1849
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,240
They don't see him.

1850
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,040
Maybe he's low here, I think.

1851
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,060
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he ran to zone.

1852
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
Or like... he got scared.

1853
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,460
He was like, girls, and then he got scared.

1854
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,700
There's one guy here.

1855
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,340
Which one?

1856
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:19,980
Over here.

1857
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,700
Oh, they're fighting.

1858
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,980
Yeah, go, go, ditto, go.

1859
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:23,880
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1860
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,180
Go, go, go, go, go.

1861
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,520
Did they shoot us?

1862
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1863
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,320
I broke one.

1864
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,100
Only Hiro shot.

1865
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,460
Yes, I broke one.

1866
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:30,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1867
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,360
Go, Hiro.

1868
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,100
Go, ditto.

1869
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,380
Go.

1870
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,780
Wait, is he right here?

1871
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,380
Watson, Watson 1.

1872
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:36,740
Watson 1.

1873
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,660
Watson's low, Watson's low.

1874
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,200
You got Watson?

1875
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,080
Nice.

1876
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,700
Yeah, I got one.

1877
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,540
Flash, flash.

1878
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,000
He's flash, flash, flash.

1879
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah, this is flash.

1880
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,680
Be careful, be careful.

1881
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,020
Flash the guy too.

1882
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,260
I'm dying.

1883
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,560
I'm gonna kill the Watson.

1884
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,620
Okay, I will go left.

1885
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,520
I will go left.

1886
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,440
Wait, there's another guy there.

1887
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,420
Okay.

1888
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,140
Wait, he went down, he went down.

1889
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,460
Okay.

1890
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,160
Another guy in front of me.

1891
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,740
Wait, she's here, she's here.

1892
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,340
She's here.

1893
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:05,980
Conduit's here.

1894
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:06,720
Okay.

1895
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Wait, she's here, she's here.

1896
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:06,720

Okay, okay, I'm going.

Okay, okay.

1900
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:11,920
All right.

1901
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,040
They might part the back.

1902
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,220
I'm not sure.

1903
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,540
There's someone down here.

1904
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,540
They don't, they don't, they don't...

1905
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,380
They don't... They went down.

1906
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,660
Wait, I see them, I see them.

1907
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,480
Wait, they did...

1908
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:21,760
Wait, they come back.

1909
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,380
They come back.

1910
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:22,720
Oh my god.

1911
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,480
They came back.

1912
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,560
They came back.

1913
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,460
They're fighting, they're fighting, they're fighting.

1914
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:27,860
Oh there's another team.

1915
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,140
She's back.

1916
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,480
They're fighting, they're fighting in front of me.

1917
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:28,860
Okay.

1918
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,500
Right here, right here, right here.

1919
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,540
Oh, what the heck.

1920
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,760
What are they doing?

1921
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,140
Wait, they took a portal in here.

1922
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,120
I'll go there.

1923
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,280
Go go go go go.

1924
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,120
I'll go with her.

1925
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,800
I broke.

1926
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,780
There's a rez behind me.

1927
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:46,640
Okay.

1928
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,580
I'm gonna look at this rez.

1929
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,140
Where is she?

1930
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,480
What the fuck?

1931
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,480
What's going on?

1932
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, inside.

1933
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,380
Inside.

1934
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,820
There's two.

1935
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,220
There's a lot of teams.

1936
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,320
There's a lot of teams.

1937
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,040
There's one just behind us too.

1938
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,340
I'm coming to you.

1939
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:09,860
I'm coming to you guys.

1940
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,960
I'm coming to you guys.

1941
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,280
Wait, low.

1942
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:12,680
Low.

1943
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,000
Low.

1944
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,200
Low.

1945
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:13,980
Okay.

1946
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,480
I'm helping.

1947
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:15,960
I'm trying to help.

1948
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,500
I'm getting shot from behind.

1949
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,020
Okay, wait.

1950
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,320
Wait.

1951
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:20,460
Wait.

1952
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,800
Keep crawling to me.

1953
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,240
He's trying to thirst me.

1954
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,700
No, he's low.

1955
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,160
He's low.

1956
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,500
He's not going to.

1957
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,020
No, he's not.

1958
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,500
He's not.

1959
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,080
Okay, I'm here.

1960
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,540
This is going to be really risky though.

1961
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,300
I think they're landing.

1962
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,280
Are you ready?

1963
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:38,960
Yeah.

1964
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,620
Okay, I went to ditto.

1965
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,940
Bloodhound is low.

1966
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,820
Okay, I'm gonna...

1967
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,360
Wait.

1968
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:48,800
Wait.

1969
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,060
Wait.

1970
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,360
You're fine.

1971
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:50,720
You're fine.

1972
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,560
Someone's pushing you.

1973
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,780
Someone's pushing you there.

1974
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:55,920
No!

1975
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,840
Oh no!

1976
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,620
Someone's pushing us.

1977
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,420
Someone's pushing us.

1978
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,600
I'm safe though.

1979
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:05,980
I'm safe.

1980
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:07,800
I'm safe.

1981
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,120
I'm safe.

1982
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,740
They're not here.

1983
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,140
They're not here.

1984
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:09,580
Really?

1985
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,780
Can you crawl?

1986
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,960
Oh, is that a person over there?

1987
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,480
Are you safe?

1988
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,380
I don't know.

1989
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,480
I'll go to her too.

1990
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,060
There's one person.

1991
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,440
One person.

1992
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,440
Two.

1993
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:21,660
Two.

1994
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:21,780
Two.

1995
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:21,880
Two.

1996
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,220
Two.

1997
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:23,640
Wait.

1998
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,860
There's someone at the back.

1999
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,060
Oh my god.

2000
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,680
Too much.

2001
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,440
Too much.

2002
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,180
Too much.

2003
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,500
Only two, two.

2004
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:30,960
Oh my god.

2005
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,320
Why did he shoot me?

2006
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,340
You...

2007
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,280
How should I kiss others?

2008
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:38,760
Wait.

2009
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,520
He hid them.

2010
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:39,980
No.

2011
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:40,880
No.

2012
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,580
Let's protect each other.

2013
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,740
We're coming to you.

2014
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,300
We're coming to you.

2015
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,900
Ditto, you can craft us.

2016
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,200
Ditto.

2017
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,200
You can craft us.

2018
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,980
They'll craft us.

2019
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,320
Okay, okay.

2020
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,000
Let them kill you.

2021
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,620
I'm dead.

2022
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,340
I'm dead.

2023
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:57,620
I'm dead.

2024
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,020
I'm dead.

2025
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,780
Oh no!

2026
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,420
It's okay, you're almost dead.

2027
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,860
Please kill me!

2028
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,470
Somebody show...

2029
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,260
I'm gonna go to this bomb.

2030
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:10,820
No!

2031
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,000
It doesn't kill me!

2032
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,560
Oh my god!

2033
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,380
Please!

2034
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,940
Die!

2035
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,300
Two seconds!

2036
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,460
Okay.

2037
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,020
Okay, I'm dead.

2038
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,020
Do you have res beacon?

2039
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,220
Where can I... I don't have it.

2040
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:29,920
I don't have it.

2041
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,120
I will go find it.

2042
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,580
Can you though?

2043
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,900
There are so many people.

2044
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,100
How many people are there?

2045
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,280
A lot.

2046
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,420
Okay.

2047
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,240
Oh, there is an egg squad.

2048
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,640
Yeah?

2049
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,260
I will try to get you...

2050
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,300
I will try to get you...

2051
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,460
I think I have a res beacon.

2052
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,400
I think I have one.

2053
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,440
You should go over and see.

2054
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,140
I think I have one.

2055
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:01,720
Oh no!

2056
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,600
They are still there!

2057
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,140
No, no, no!

2058
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,900
They ran!

2059
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,840
They rotated.

2060
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,200
No, no, they rotated!

2061
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,320
No, no, they rotated!

2062
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,160
I'm just joking!

2063
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,420
You were right!

2064
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,720
You were right!

2065
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:19,120
No, I swear!

2066
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,540
They rotated now!

2067
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,140
Check, check, check!

2068
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,400
See, they are gone!

2069
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:22,900
They are gone!

2070
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,620
They are gone!

2071
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't know!

2072
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,740
I don't want to say a bad word, but are you blind?

2073
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,740
What's the bad word?

2074
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,040
See, they are gone!

2075
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,440
They are gone!

2076
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,140
Because of me!

2077
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,020
No, they are not!

2078
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,780
They took a sip!

2079
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,200
Yes!

2080
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,440
Are you blind?

2081
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:42,840
Really?

2082
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,580
Yeah!

2083
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,740
They took a jump pad!

2084
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,760
Wait, wait.

2085
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,420
I have to find...

2086
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:49,860
Yeah, yeah.

2087
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:50,680
Outside?

2088
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,400
Okay.

2089
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,100
Yeah, yeah.

2090
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,500
It's outside.

2091
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,380
Check in my...

2092
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,060
Where is your... where is your... It's outside!

2093
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:57,680
It's outside!

2094
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,480
On the other side!

2095
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,060
On the other side!

2096
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:00,420
Yeah, yeah.

2097
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:00,940
The other side.

2098
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,980
See, they are fighting!

2099
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:02,900
It's your left!

2100
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,340
See that?

2101
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2102
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,160
That's not mine.

2103
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:05,960
It's mine.

2104
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:06,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2105
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,600
You had one too!

2106
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,380
You didn't see it!

2107
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,120
Wait, I didn't know!

2108
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,920
No, no, no!

2109
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,680
Why did you shoot?

2110
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,340
You could have rest!

2111
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,600
I can't rest.

2112
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,280
I can't rest.

2113
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,000
Trust me, trust me.

2114
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,520
Okay, okay.

2115
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,000
I trust you.

2116
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:22,340
Oh my god!

2117
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,120
Okay.

2118
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:23,880
I trust you.

2119
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,440
I trust you.

2120
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,380
We could rest right here.

2121
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,640
Oh my god!

2122
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,320
Okay.

2123
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,640
I don't trust you anymore.

2124
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,060
Okay.

2125
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,360
It's okay.

2126
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,200
Put the recipe in here!

2127
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:34,380
Slow.

2128
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,140
Oh, wait.

2129
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,460
No, no.

2130
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:35,840
Don't put it in.

2131
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2132
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,320
We can't.

2133
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,980
No, no, no, no, no.

2134
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,760
You have to leave though.

2135
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,200
You have to leave.

2136
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,980
This is not so... Okay, okay.

2137
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,600
I will leave.

2138
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,460
Goodbye!

2139
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:53,860
Oh my god!

2140
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,400
I did it!

2141
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
I did it!

2142
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,260
She's so good.

2143
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,300
Oh my god, see!

2144
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,120
I told you!

2145
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,880
You were the wingman person!

2146
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,500
Wait!

2147
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,260
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no!

2148
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,860
Oh my god, you did it!

2149
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,820
Oh, I did it!

2150
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,080
Congratulations!

2151
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,920
You did it!

2152
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,260
We did it because Nozzy died first.

2153
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,500
Wait, what a rank difference.

2154
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,460
Wait, let me go back to the lobby.

2155
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,600
Okay.

2156
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,840
Bad news, it says rank difference.

2157
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,300
There's rank difference?

2158
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,260
Who?

2159
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,160
Tero got gold!

2160
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,900
Tero got gold!

2161
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,080
Can we play together?

2162
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,140
You're too high!

2163
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,380
No!

2164
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,620
Here, here!

2165
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,440
You go with Toki and rank up to silver.

2166
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,460
How did that happen?

2167
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,640
I was just...

2168
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,680
Do you mean we play one...

2169
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,740
Wait, I...

2170
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,480
Wait!

2171
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,460
Did I go to bronze?

2172
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,120
Is it not?

2173
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,780
You're a rookie!

2174
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:20,380
Why?

2175
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,240
It's because you're a rookie and like, Ditto's gold!

2176
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,540
Also, here's 10 subs.

2177
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,980
Oh, thank you, Toki!

2178
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,620
Thanks for the sub!

2179
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,560
Thank you!

2180
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,120
Don't worry, look, look.

2181
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,380
We'll gain the RP back.

2182
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,520
Really, really fast.

2183
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,660
Okay, okay, I'm gonna exit.

2184
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:33,860
Here.

2185
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,100
Okay.

2186
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:34,980
Alright.

2187
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,420
Alright, Ditto, you coach us, Ditto.

2188
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,860
Yeah, actually she can just watch us and tell us what to do.

2189
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,240
Okay, okay.

2190
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,860
Can someone, um, share me some screen?

2191
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:46,900
Watch our stream!

2192
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,080
Watch it now!

2193
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,000
Okay, okay.

2194
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,600
Coach us!

2195
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,700
Okay.

2196
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,340
I'll stream.

2197
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:54,820
I'll stream.

2198
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:55,420
I'll be coasting, guys.

2199
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,160
I'll be coasting, guys.

2200
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,760
Isn't there like a relay?

2201
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,520
Oh, I'll stream, yeah.

2202
00:55:59,440 --> 00:55:59,940
Yeah.

2203
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,780
It's okay, it's okay.

2204
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:01,760
It's okay.

2205
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,400
Really?

2206
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay.

2207
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:03,520
Yeah.

2208
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,420
Alright.

2209
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,160
Don't worry.

2210
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,360
How- wait, what rank are you now?

2211
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,800
Wait, you just- we just need one win!

2212
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,620
Your rookie won!

2213
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,120
Yeah, I'm rookie one!

2214
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,980
Yeah, we just need one win!

2215
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:11,840
I'm like, I'm like almost there.

2216
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,080
I don't even need to win, I think.

2217
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,200
I just need to kill somebody.

2218
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:16,700
Yeah, you just need to kill people.

2219
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,120
Okay, let's land on somebody then.

2220
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,020
Okay!

2221
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:19,700
Yeah.

2222
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,320
How many points do you- um, do you need?

2223
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,560
Yeah, how many points do you need?

2224
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,540
Uh, 100, I think?

2225
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,420
Oh!

2226
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,080
It's really easy!

2227
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,740
It's really easy.

2228
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,920
Like, rookie is like... That's one kill.

2229
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,140
Yeah.

2230
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,840
That's like two to three kills, I think.

2231
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,620
Maybe?

2232
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:39,300
No, like, rookie is like really, like, any- anything is like... like 50 points, isn't it?

2233
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:39,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2234
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,440
Alright.

2235
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,940
I believe in us.

2236
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,400
We can do this.

2237
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,440
I believe.

2238
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,460
Okay, Deco's watching us, so I believe.

2239
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,780
Yeah, I will do wash party.

2240
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,960
Alright, sound guy, turn him down a little bit.

2241
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,380
Poach this!

2242
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,940
Yeah, wash party, yes.

2243
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,380
Are you streaming here?

2244
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,840
I'm not streaming right now, yeah.

2245
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,720
But you said it was okay!

2246
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,080
Okay.

2247
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:04,680
Yeah.

2248
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,800
Do you need me to open it on Discord?

2249
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,460
Oh, yes!

2250
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,340
Yes, yes, yes.

2251
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,660
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2252
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:11,820
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2253
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,660
Don't worry.

2254
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,100
Wait, wait, wait.

2255
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,060
Let me do it.

2256
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:14,940
Okay.

2257
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,200
It's okay, we're not Jump Master.

2258
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:16,520
No!

2259
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,060
This guy might play like a pussy!

2260
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,240
Because he's- he's Jump Master.

2261
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,460
What?

2262
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,540
You're not playing like a coward!

2263
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,300
Why did you call him pussy?

2264
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,100
Because he's not jumping!

2265
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,900
Oh, never mind, no, no, no.

2266
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,620
He is not pussy.

2267
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,460
He's thinking it's a fucking fragment.

2268
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,500
We're gonna fight-fight here.

2269
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,360
We're going to fragment.

2270
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,300
Oh, I'm sharing my screen.

2271
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:40,980
Here you go.

2272
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,780
Okay, okay.

2273
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,880
Oh, thank you.

2274
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,640
Thank you.

2275
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,520
Oh, no, we're fight-fighting.

2276
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,160
Wait, I'm like, my keyboard is wrong now.

2277
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,520
Oh my god, wait, I can't find it.

2278
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,920
Your keyboard is wrong?

2279
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,160
I'm typing in Japanese, wait!

2280
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,100
Okay, wait, okay.

2281
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,960
It's okay, we're gonna type too.

2282
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,380
Wait, he's fighting already!

2283
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,160
He's already fighting!

2284
00:57:59,240 --> 00:57:59,520
He's actually fighting.

2285
00:57:59,620 --> 00:57:59,880
Oh, okay.

2286
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,060
That's what I'm saying!

2287
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,900
He's fighting-fighting, he's not pussy!

2288
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,340
Okay, I'm going.

2289
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,920
I'm gonna fight.

2290
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,080
Okay, I'm heading over here.

2291
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,280
You gotta- Wait, there's actually a gold knock.

2292
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:08,760
Here.

2293
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,400
Oh, wait, that's good.

2294
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I need that, actually.

2295
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,160
Alright.

2296
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,840
Um, um, okay.

2297
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,840
Alright, what should we do, coach?

2298
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,600
Coach, what do we do?

2299
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,560
Just loot!

2300
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,480
Loot fight.

2301
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,640
Just loot?

2302
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,900
We're not gonna fight.

2303
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,620
She's actually fighting, though.

2304
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,620
Oh, no, we have to help him.

2305
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,480
Oh, no.

2306
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,540
He's dying.

2307
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,020
Oh, yeah, you have to go help.

2308
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,160
I cracked him, I cracked him!

2309
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,300
Okay.

2310
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,860
Okay, I'm gonna go fight.

2311
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,500
Nice.

2312
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,700
Where is this other guy?

2313
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,100
At the bottom, they're all at the bottom.

2314
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,600
Okay.

2315
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,700
Oh, nice.

2316
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,940
Oh, goodbye.

2317
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Wait, he's cracked?

2318
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,920
That guy's low.

2319
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,060
Oh, there's a- He's not that low.

2320
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,880
He's low, too.

2321
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:43,660
Got him?

2322
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,660
Nice, nice.

2323
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,280
I'm here.

2324
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,620
Nice.

2325
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,900
Oh, I cracked him?

2326
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,220
Nice!

2327
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,040
Nice, nice, nice.

2328
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,300
Yay, we're so good!

2329
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,060
Is that 100 points already?

2330
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,120
I have plus 45 by the way.

2331
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,180
Oh, okay.

2332
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,340
We need a few- We just need a few more and we're good.

2333
00:58:59,440 --> 00:58:59,840
Oh, I have plus 45.

2334
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,600
Oh, I put a heal drone right here.

2335
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,280
Okay, you heal first.

2336
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:02,740
Heal.

2337
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2338
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,280
I put heal drone here.

2339
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,640
Oh, my God!

2340
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,840
Wait, yes, Coach!

2341
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,160
Yes, Ma'am.

2342
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,440
I didn't do nothing.

2343
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,480
I'm gonna go rez.

2344
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:15,540
I'm gonna rez.

2345
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,640
Oh, wait, I heard somebody.

2346
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,000
Really?

2347
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,780
No, GK.

2348
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:23,920
I'm gonna have a respawn.

2349
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,480
You can't trust her heal.

2350
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,780
The only one who can trust is me.

2351
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,080
What do you mean you can't trust me?

2352
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,840
I'm in the middle of the match, I'm gonna go rest.

2353
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,780
What do you mean?

2354
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,180
She's a liar!

2355
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,480
I'm not a liar!

2356
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,260
Wait, there's somebody here.

2357
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,320
I'll kill them, watch this.

2358
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,200
I'm not a liar.

2359
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,180
You're a liar for lying that... for saying I'm a liar.

2360
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,020
You're lying.

2361
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,820
I would never lie.

2362
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,940
I would never lie to you, Hiro.

2363
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,840
I would never lie to you.

2364
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,880
Hiro, Hiro.

2365
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:01,240
You should better not trust Doge.

2366
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,100
What?

2367
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,800
I'm your healer.

2368
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,880
You have to trust me.

2369
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:05,880
I'm your support player.

2370
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,560
Okay, that guy's on top.

2371
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,960
You got this, Hiro.

2372
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:10,880
I believe in you.

2373
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,320
I'm looting.

2374
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:11,680
Really?

2375
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,580
Okay, okay.

2376
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,100
I got it.

2377
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:13,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2378
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:13,920
You got this.

2379
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,680
Look, our third is here now.

2380
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:16,680
He can be bait.

2381
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,380
Wait, where is he?

2382
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,200
Okay, on the bridge.

2383
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:20,620
Oh, here.

2384
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,280
I see him.

2385
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,340
Doge, find the cover and shoot, okay?

2386
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:25,820
Okay.

2387
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,140
I'm finding cover.

2388
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:27,800
I'm finding cover.

2389
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,600
I'm looting.

2390
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:29,780
Oh, nice, nice.

2391
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,640
My cover, nice cover.

2392
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,740
Oh my god, do you see my cover?

2393
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,820
If you crack them, you can push.

2394
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:35,680
Oh, okay.

2395
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,360
Did we crack them?

2396
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:36,780
A little bit.

2397
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,040
Oh my god, really?

2398
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,260
Oh, I'm gonna push this.

2399
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,220
Did you crack them?

2400
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,140
No, but...

2401
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,740
No, but you pushed.

2402
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,080
Okay.

2403
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:46,320
No, but I'm gonna push.

2404
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,340
Yeah, but I killed him.

2405
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,680
Nice one, nice one.

2406
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,740
Yeah, I killed him.

2407
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,080
He's flesh.

2408
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,100
Nice, nice.

2409
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:53,760
How did he die?

2410
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,300
Oh, nice, nice.

2411
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,660
How did I kill him?

2412
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:56,520
Why?

2413
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:00,480
Oh, my god, that's sad.

2414
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,600
I literally don't know how a guy died.

2415
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,700
Nice, nice.

2416
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,240
See, we did it.

2417
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,380
Coach, we did it.

2418
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,200
Are you good?

2419
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:09,520
Nice, nice.

2420
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,780
You have 100 points now?

2421
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,080
50.

2422
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,740
I have 95.

2423
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,680
Oh, 95.

2424
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,800
We just need 5 more.

2425
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,760
95, 95.

2426
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,820
Yeah, we just need 5 more.

2427
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,420
There's a lot.

2428
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,140
Let's go find some more.

2429
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:25,720
95.

2430
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,900
Yeah, there's 12 scores left and it's 95.

2431
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,520
Oh, yeah.

2432
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,200
You're in the rookie.

2433
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,500
Yeah, yeah, because she's rookie.

2434
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,700
She gains like a hundred... a million points.

2435
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,500
I'm so...

2436
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,840
We have 5 more, you know.

2437
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,680
I wonder how many points you can get.

2438
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,800
Like the max... like maximum points.

2439
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,840
I think it's like 500 plus.

2440
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,520
Really?

2441
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,040
I'm pretty sure.

2442
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,480
Maybe more.

2443
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,520
Isn't it more now?

2444
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,100
Is it more?

2445
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,800
I don't know.

2446
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:49,620
I haven't been in.

2447
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,340
Like, it was so fast to get out of rookie.

2448
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,840
It literally took like 2 wins.

2449
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,120
From like...

2450
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,520
There's like nobody here.

2451
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,640
There is nobody here.

2452
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,760
But like...

2453
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,140
Oh, yay.

2454
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,380
But I can do this.

2455
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,540
Oh, what's in the package?

2456
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,360
Let's see.

2457
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,460
This?

2458
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,620
Oh, this.

2459
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,660
I need that.

2460
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,000
Triple take.

2461
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,020
Alright, alright.

2462
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:18,320
Doki, you are lifelike so you have to give the... what is that?

2463
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,380
The what?

2464
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,100
Evil Harvester to your teammate.

2465
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:21,320
I just took it.

2466
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:25,320
See?

2467
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,900
You don't listen to your coach.

2468
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,520
It's just because I'm just a bad player.

2469
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,380
You're a bad coach.

2470
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,420
You're just a bad coach.

2471
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,940
I'm a bad coach like my papa.

2472
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,160
I teach you how... I teach you how like he teach me.

2473
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,000
It's not my fault.

2474
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,940
You're right.

2475
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,520
It's RPR's fault.

2476
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,720
How dare you.

2477
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,880
He's such a bad teacher.

2478
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,480
I'm just teaching you like... yeah.

2479
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,440
I teach you what he teach me.

2480
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,300
I feel like every time I play with you guys, you get...

2481
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:58,760
Guys!

2482
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,360
Hiro!

2483
01:02:59,520 --> 01:02:59,800
Hiro!

2484
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,080
Hiro!

2485
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,320
Wait, I'm so far.

2486
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,620
Only... only the...

2487
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,840
Wait, I'm not... I'm not there.

2488
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:05,260
No!

2489
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:05,320
Hiro!

2490
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,720
Wait, she put an... she put an ult down.

2491
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,500
She put an ult down for you.

2492
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:08,880
What do you mean no?

2493
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,340
What do you mean no?

2494
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,240
Wait, I'm here but she's looking at me.

2495
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,580
I'm gonna put an ult down.

2496
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,580
That's fine.

2497
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,060
That's fine.

2498
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:17,400
That's fine.

2499
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,520
Why did you know me?

2500
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,360
She's there.

2501
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,820
She's there.

2502
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,560
Doki, Doki.

2503
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2504
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,040
I'm at the portal.

2505
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:23,880
I'm at the portal.

2506
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,280
Nice.

2507
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:24,280
Nice.

2508
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,260
Where are you?

2509
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,100
She took the portal!

2510
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:28,820
She took the portal!

2511
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,920
Oh, she took the portal too?

2512
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:31,980
I'm coming.

2513
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,480
I'm coming too.

2514
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:32,980
I'm coming too.

2515
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:34,900
Oh, no!

2516
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,760
I got shot by three different people!

2517
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:37,580
No!

2518
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,020
Oh, that's her keyword, bitch!

2519
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,220
I'll look if she reses.

2520
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,440
I'm gonna look for you if she reses.

2521
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:46,880
Why?

2522
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,260
Why did she try to finish you?

2523
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,240
Yeah, yeah.

2524
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:49,980
Oh, she res.

2525
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:50,380
She res.

2526
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:51,440
No!

2527
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,220
No, try to finish.

2528
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,520
Yeah, bitch!

2529
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,300
Oh, now you get 100.

2530
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,040
You got 100, right?

2531
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,540
Yeah, 100.

2532
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,320
Yeah, 100.

2533
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,620
I think I got it.

2534
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,480
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

2535
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,060
You got it.

2536
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,720
Yeah, yeah.

2537
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,280
Oh, nice.

2538
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:02,760
Okay.

2539
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,020
Yeah, now we can leave.

2540
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:06,660
Okay.

2541
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,380
We can leave now.

2542
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,080
That'd be funny if you're just like 1.5.

2543
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:12,460
Please don't.

2544
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,280
No, no, no.

2545
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,260
I'm here now.

2546
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:15,260
Okay?

2547
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:16,300
Yeah.

2548
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,180
No, I'm bronze.

2549
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:17,600
I'm bronze.

2550
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,300
Yeah, yeah, bronze.

2551
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:18,780
I'm bronze.

2552
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,040
Okay, dude.

2553
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:20,520
Nice.

2554
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,560
Join us, dude.

2555
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:21,980
Join me.

2556
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,240
All right.

2557
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,580
I can't.

2558
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,460
I can't.

2559
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:24,940
I can't.

2560
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,400
Okay, where are you?

2561
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,960
Why didn't you like send a friend request to Hiro while you're in the lobby?

2562
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,720
Hiro is offline.

2563
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,880
You could send a friend request right now.

2564
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,880
Oh, she's offline.

2565
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,740
Maybe it's your name.

2566
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:39,140
No, she's not.

2567
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:40,580
Liar.

2568
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,820
I joined off of her.

2569
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,240
It's a lie.

2570
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:42,780
See?

2571
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,660
I joined off of her.

2572
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,440
My screenshot.

2573
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,160
Kara, I will give you my screenshot.

2574
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:52,740
Photoshop.

2575
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,960
She's offline.

2576
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,900
Oh, yeah.

2577
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,260
Oh, my God.

2578
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,400
So, sound guy, turn the video down a little bit.

2579
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:02,860
Okay, I think it's a real issue.

2580
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,800
Maybe, maybe English is not the best language to communicate with Doki.

2581
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,040
What language should we use then?

2582
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,420
What do you mean?

2583
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,280
Maybe we can't use Thai.

2584
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,520
What do you mean?

2585
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,620
I'm communicating.

2586
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:21,660
Doki.

2587
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,040
It's the only thing I learned from Doki.

2588
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:23,820
Doki.

2589
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,020
What is that?

2590
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,320
No, no.

2591
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:25,760
What's that?

2592
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:25,960
You know this.

2593
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,720
This isn't Lee.

2594
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:27,900
Wait.

2595
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:28,300
What does that mean?

2596
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:28,840
What?

2597
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,660
What does that mean?

2598
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,140
You can ask.

2599
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,440
What does that mean, Ditto?

2600
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,620
What does that mean?

2601
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,640
Motherfucker.

2602
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,540
That's the only thing Ditto taught me though.

2603
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:42,720
Wow!

2604
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,500
Ditto is a bad influence.

2605
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,020
You asked me to teach you.

2606
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,480
Ditto is a bad influence.

2607
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,840
You asked me!

2608
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,780
Hiro asked me to teach her.

2609
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,600
Is that true, Hiro?

2610
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,720
Hiro!

2611
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:57,740
Hiro!

2612
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:58,760
Hiro!

2613
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:58,960
Hiro!

2614
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,620
Hiro, I don't remember.

2615
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:00,600
I have no recollection.

2616
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,740
Hiro, Hiro, Hiro!

2617
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:01,960
Remember!

2618
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,620
Remember!

2619
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,320
No, she doesn't remember.

2620
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,380
Don't pretend that you can't remember.

2621
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,600
She's not pretending!

2622
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,100
She's just old!

2623
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,020
She's pretending!

2624
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,600
She's just old!

2625
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,200
You guys are such an actor!

2626
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,760
You're an actor!

2627
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,340
It's not true!

2628
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,780
I'm not acting!

2629
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,140
You're good!

2630
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,940
I actually don't remember at all.

2631
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,580
Oh, Hiro!

2632
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,180
Hiro!

2633
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,940
You can't remember.

2634
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,780
Yeah, we're just getting old!

2635
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,860
No, no, just like how you remember.

2636
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,620
Remember when you didn't remember?

2637
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,120
Wait, there's people?

2638
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,260
Okay.

2639
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,440
No, no people.

2640
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,420
There is!

2641
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:50,900
There is!

2642
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:51,240
There is!

2643
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:51,920
Wow!

2644
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:54,540
Oh, Hiro landed on them.

2645
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:55,600
It's okay.

2646
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,660
I'm fine.

2647
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,840
I got a gun.

2648
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,060
Did somebody press the button?

2649
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,300
I'm fucked up.

2650
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:01,460
Me!

2651
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:02,620
No!

2652
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,180
Why did nobody press the button?

2653
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,140
Wait, wait, wait.

2654
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,600
They're like right here.

2655
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,420
It hits the bottom.

2656
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,240
Why did nobody press the button?

2657
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:12,900
Okay, I'm gonna...

2658
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:13,500
Why would it hit the bottom?

2659
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:14,840
There's the button!

2660
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,460
I need a present.

2661
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,580
I don't have the button here.

2662
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,240
I'm going over to...

2663
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,980
Oh, now... Oh my god, you guys.

2664
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:21,660
Now you guys...

2665
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:22,960

2666
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,660
You fuckers!

2667
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:25,880
No!

2668
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:26,900
Don't look here.

2669
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,760
I didn't press it.

2670
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,080
You press it.

2671
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,460
I'm here.

2672
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:30,620
I'm here.

2673
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:30,880
I'm here.

2674
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,060
Okay.

2675
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,380
There's one guy.

2676
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,440
Okay.

2677
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,280
Oh my god!

2678
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,260
I hit... I missed every shot.

2679
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,900
Oh my god, you could lie, you know.

2680
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,260
Okay.

2681
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,120
I'm gonna...

2682
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,600
They're shooting you.

2683
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,780
Oh yeah, they're shooting me!

2684
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,500
Okay, I... 34?

2685
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:48,940
Oh my god.

2686
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,780
I hit half of...

2687
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:51,860
Okay.

2688
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,400
I'm looking for you guys.

2689
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,460
It's okay.

2690
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:55,840
They're still not there yet.

2691
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,080
Yeah, they're just poking us.

2692
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,160
This one's leaving.

2693
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,100
What?

2694
01:07:59,100 --> 01:07:59,660
Oh, they're leaving?

2695
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,140
They're scared.

2696
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:01,560
Yeah.

2697
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,580
Wait, they're scared.

2698
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,420
You can push, you can push.

2699
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,620
Last guy, let's get here.

2700
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,220
Last guy's here.

2701
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:05,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2702
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2703
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:07,640
They're leaving.

2704
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,040
They're running.

2705
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:08,400
They're running.

2706
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:08,760
They're scared.

2707
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,320
I'm watching her.

2708
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:09,840
I'm watching her.

2709
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,340
I'm watching her.

2710
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,120
Here, here, here.

2711
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:11,240
Here, here, here.

2712
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,260
Yeah, I'm watching too.

2713
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,360
I'm trying, I'm trying.

2714
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,380
Oh my god, they're running, running.

2715
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:16,740
Just stop.

2716
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,400
Chase, chase him.

2717
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:18,940
Okay, okay.

2718
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:19,660
Oh no.

2719
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,020
Only two?

2720
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,020
Only two?

2721
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,140
No, three, three, three, three, three.

2722
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:22,560
It's three.

2723
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,220
They all...

2724
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:23,460
Three, three.

2725
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,080
Oh, what the fuck?

2726
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:25,800
That's another team.

2727
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,460
Another team, another team.

2728
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:27,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2729
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,400
Okay, we have to go back, go back and loot.

2730
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2731
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,460
We have the full place now to loot.

2732
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,240
Yeah.

2733
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,120
It's fun.

2734
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,340
Why did they leave?

2735
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:35,940
Yeah, dude.

2736
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,060
They're not dead.

2737
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:38,740
Why?

2738
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:39,860
Yeah, that's why.

2739
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:40,920
Yeah.

2740
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:41,340
I see.

2741
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:41,980
It's so stupid.

2742
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,040
Now we have all the loot.

2743
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,500
Why?

2744
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,280
Why they leave?

2745
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,900
They're scared, they're like, oh my god, they're all girls.

2746
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:51,780
I'm so scared.

2747
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,700
Oh my god.

2748
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,240
Oh my god, hoodies.

2749
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,800
Average age on Apex player.

2750
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,020
Oh my god, guys.

2751
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,280
Hoodies.

2752
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,500
What is that?

2753
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:15,540
That's it.

2754
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,260
What is cooties?

2755
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:17,880
Cooties?

2756
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,820
Oh, it's a...

2757
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,520
It's a disease that girls carry.

2758
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,520
And it only infects the boys.

2759
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,060
So when we touch a boy, they die.

2760
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:28,380
So when we touch a boy, they die.

2761
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:32,340
That's cooties.

2762
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,220
It's a real disease.

2763
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,320
Yeah, it's real.

2764
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,160
The doctor says there's no cure for cooties.

2765
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,900
Yeah, it's real.

2766
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:39,900
The doctor says there's no cure for cooties.

2767
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,200
I see, I see.

2768
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,000
There's no cure.

2769
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,800
It's very dangerous.

2770
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,460
Oh, wingman!

2771
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,340
Are you still gonna do it?

2772
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,980
No, no, no.

2773
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:54,020
Oh.

2774
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:56,980
I think we can fight this team.

2775
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:57,580
Alright.

2776
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:58,960
Let me...

2777
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,360
Eh?

2778
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,620
Can you scan?

2779
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,000
Scan, okay.

2780
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,840
Yeah, okay.

2781
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,160
Anyone nearby?

2782
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:05,920
Wait, they're here.

2783
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:06,540
Right here.

2784
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,600
Oh, yeah, I see them.

2785
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:07,920
I see them.

2786
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,240
I see them.

2787
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:08,760
They're really close.

2788
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:09,820
Oh, they're why?

2789
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,220
Okay, okay.

2790
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,000
Only one?

2791
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:12,620
Yeah, there's only one.

2792
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,120
Okay.

2793
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:13,580
You know what?

2794
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,320
I'm gonna... I'm gonna EMP him right now.

2795
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,560
That's so cute!

2796
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,500
White armor!

2797
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,300
White armor!

2798
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:19,880
White armor!

2799
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,420
Nice, nice, nice!

2800
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,540
That's so sad.

2801
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,040
Oh my god, that poor guy.

2802
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,740
He got his streamer mode.

2803
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:29,740
Where's your teammates?

2804
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,640
Oh no, the cooties got him.

2805
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,240
We gave him cooties.

2806
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,140
Oh no!

2807
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,700
Wait, let me check if they're still here.

2808
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:45,160
Yeah, they're still here.

2809
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:45,900
They're still here.

2810
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,080
They still have to be.

2811
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,300
Like, where are they?

2812
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,300
Where did they go?

2813
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,060
They're so scared.

2814
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:53,860
Okay, I...

2815
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:57,540
Maybe you can read the...

2816
01:10:58,620 --> 01:10:59,820
Let me scan.

2817
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah, yeah, people scan.

2818
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,940
We've never done that.

2819
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,680
I will scan the ring.

2820
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,500
I'm gonna grab the bats here.

2821
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,400
I will go scan the ring.

2822
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:10,880
I will go scan the ring.

2823
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:10,940
Alright.

2824
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,640
It's kinda far.

2825
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,020
Maybe they ran away.

2826
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,800
I mean, but Hiro still sees them.

2827
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:20,980
Yeah, it's...

2828
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,880
They're still here.

2829
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,760
Oh wait, they're gone.

2830
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,480
Oh, they're gone?

2831
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,040
Oh, okay.

2832
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,400
Can you scan here?

2833
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,980
Yeah, we might as well scan it just in case.

2834
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,360
Yeah, I don't have too far.

2835
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,640
You know what, I'm gonna be here.

2836
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,720
Yeah, if you're too far, I'll punch you closer.

2837
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,640
Oh god, don't punch me in the lap.

2838
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,020
What do you mean?

2839
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,800
I'm in a really dangerous position right now.

2840
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:46,640
I know.

2841
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:46,780
Okay.

2842
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,960
God, I'm so scared.

2843
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,720
Wait, you're actually punching me?

2844
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,540
What do you mean?

2845
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:54,120
I would never.

2846
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:54,800
Okay, they're here.

2847
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,900
There's one guy over here.

2848
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,620
Do you wanna fight the Saging or Skyhook?

2849
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,860
Okay, maybe there's a teammate.

2850
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,560
Yeah, do you wanna do Skyhook?

2851
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,740
Okay, let's do Skyhook.

2852
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,400
There's only one team here in the solo.

2853
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,980
Let's do Skyhook.

2854
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,140
Where should we go?

2855
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,400
I want to go Skyhook.

2856
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,120
Yeah, let's go Skyhook.

2857
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,060
Wait, do you fight?

2858
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:15,740
What's that?

2859
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,800
There's like bullets there.

2860
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,440
It's a solo and a team there.

2861
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,700
Yeah, and a team.

2862
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,920
We go Skyhook because there's a lot of teams.

2863
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,000
And I think they will have a long fight.

2864
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,240
Yeah, let's go there.

2865
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,140
I'm heading there.

2866
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,040
Okay, I'm just taking a little bit of the days.

2867
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,300
I'm gonna grab some more ammo.

2868
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,820
Alright, I'm heading over.

2869
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:40,540
Don't worry.

2870
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,500
Frontline, Lifeline is here.

2871
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:43,520
Okay.

2872
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:47,280
Do you think they are still fighting or no?

2873
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,580
There was two.

2874
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,340
There was two in the solo.

2875
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,720
There were two and there was one team over there.

2876
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,360
Yeah, yeah.

2877
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,160
I feel like we'll bump into somebody.

2878
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,500
There were like three.

2879
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,760
Yeah.

2880
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,620
We'll figure it out when we get there.

2881
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,320
I can't hear anything.

2882
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,600
I don't hear anything either.

2883
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,040
Wait, wait, wait.

2884
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,480
In front of me.

2885
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,220
Oh shit, that might be them.

2886
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:09,940
Behind them?

2887
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,980
Oh my god, in front of me.

2888
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:11,900
Two, two, two.

2889
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,560
I knocked one.

2890
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:14,240
I knocked one.

2891
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,300
Nice one.

2892
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:18,620
They're low.

2893
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,180
I knocked two.

2894
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:20,980
I'm going to.

2895
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:21,440
I'm going to.

2896
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,800
I don't know where the last guy is.

2897
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,640
Okay, you got this.

2898
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,020
I did my job.

2899
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:30,600
Okay.

2900
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,920
I already did my job, so it's your turn.

2901
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,540
Oh my gosh.

2902
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,320
Why were they in white armor?

2903
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,100
That was so close.

2904
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:40,960
That was so close.

2905
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,880
But they were white armor.

2906
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,640
I didn't hear anything.

2907
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,380
So they're like extra bad.

2908
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,980
Maybe they just revived?

2909
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,100
No, you revive and get your armor.

2910
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,240
That's the thing.

2911
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2912
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,880
You still get your armor.

2913
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,220
Wait, wait, wait.

2914
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:57,920
Not the team.

2915
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,320
Not the team.

2916
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,020
In front of you?

2917
01:13:59,120 --> 01:13:59,220
Oh.

2918
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,880
Oh, okay, there.

2919
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:01,620
Okay.

2920
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,540
I'm pushing.

2921
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,760
Oh my god.

2922
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:08,680
I'm pushing toes.

2923
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,220
Wait, I'm not.

2924
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,340
It's okay.

2925
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,200
I believe you, Dato.

2926
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,360
I'm shooting.

2927
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,120
I'm shooting.

2928
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,260
I can't.

2929
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,140
I don't stop shooting.

2930
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,040
You're shooting.

2931
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:19,500
You're shooting.

2932
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,260
I'm shooting too.

2933
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:20,500
You got it.

2934
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:21,960
There's grenades.

2935
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,200
I got him.

2936
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:23,660
I got one.

2937
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:24,580
Okay, okay, okay.

2938
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,380
I'm batting.

2939
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,320
I'm batting.

2940
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:26,860
Okay, okay.

2941
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,580
Two left.

2942
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:28,980
One left.

2943
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:29,240
One left.

2944
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,500
I can't help.

2945
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,540
She's here.

2946
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,700
You got this, Hiro.

2947
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:33,120
It's your turn.

2948
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:33,880
We got our ones.

2949
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
She's running to you guys.

2950
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:36,780
She has one.

2951
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,220
She's running to us?

2952
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,200
You got this, Hiro.

2953
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:39,620
I'm gonna loot.

2954
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:40,740
No, let Hiro kill her.

2955
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:41,240
Let Hiro.

2956
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:47,560
I just wanted to see Hiro kill them.

2957
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2958
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,820
We just wanna watch you cry.

2959
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,600
We each got our ones.

2960
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,760
Okay.

2961
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:54,680
Nice.

2962
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,140
I like Ditto's comms.

2963
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,180
Never stop shooting.

2964
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,760
No reload.

2965
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,560
Just shoot.

2966
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,100
Okay.

2967
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:06,540
Alright.

2968
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,900
Let's see.

2969
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,480
Oh, nice.

2970
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,220
You didn't give Hiro purple armor.

2971
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,100
That's so fucked.

2972
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,980
Ditto, you're not a team player.

2973
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,940
If I didn't get purple armor, I would've been so fucked.

2974
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,600
I didn't take it.

2975
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,760
You were gonna take it.

2976
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:24,740
That's not true.

2977
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:25,840
No.

2978
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,040
That's true.

2979
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,780
I wasn't giving Hiro the armor.

2980
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,860
That's true.

2981
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,380
You did.

2982
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,480
You did it before.

2983
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,760
No, that's not true.

2984
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,740
I did it to you.

2985
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,200
That's true.

2986
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,100
But I won't do it to Hiro.

2987
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:38,960
No.

2988
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,560
I'm running away.

2989
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,300
It's okay.

2990
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,400
I'm too sad.

2991
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,720
Hiro will understand me.

2992
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,380
Hiro's sad right now.

2993
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,240
What do you mean?

2994
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,320
I'm just gonna be on my drone next time.

2995
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,020
She's not sad.

2996
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,000
She's sad.

2997
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,580
She's not.

2998
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,100
Ditto, why did you hit her?

2999
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:57,260
Ditto, why did you hit her?

3000
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,380
You're in the open.

3001
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,640
You're in the open.

3002
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,460
You're in the open, Hiro.

3003
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,660
Ditto often does this to me.

3004
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,300
Ditto, why would you do that?

3005
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,820
Ditto, why would you do that?

3006
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:13,380
You're so...

3007
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,240
That's so fucked.

3008
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,740
I'm in the grass.

3009
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,680
Oh my god.

3010
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,420
I'm so fucked up, Ditto.

3011
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,220
I'm so...

3012
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,820
Poor Hiro.

3013
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:27,940
She's getting a bleed.

3014
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,280
She can get...

3015
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,420
purple armor herself.

3016
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,700
You know what?

3017
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,060
I'm just gonna stand right here.

3018
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,260
Come here, come here, doggy.

3019
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,120
Why me?

3020
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,400
Captain!

3021
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:41,940
Captain!

3022
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,380
She's dead.

3023
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:43,920
She's dead.

3024
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,260
Why me?

3025
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:47,260
Why?

3026
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,680
We have to come here.

3027
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:51,780
Only one.

3028
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,580
Only one here.

3029
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,920
I'm getting shot at.

3030
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:55,180
No, no, no.

3031
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,680
I'm getting back.

3032
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,000
Okay.

3033
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:00,360
I cracked.

3034
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:00,660
I cracked.

3035
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,100
Ditto, I cracked him.

3036
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,140
Why didn't you go out?

3037
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:04,940
Why didn't you go?

3038
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,580
Wait, wait, wait.

3039
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,540
Behind, behind, behind.

3040
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,480
Wait, she's...

3041
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:12,960
Oh my god.

3042
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,020
Okay, okay.

3043
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,920
What the fuck?

3044
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,600
Please!

3045
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,120
Please, hello.

3046
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,040
Guys, I'm getting...

3047
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,620
I'm getting cyberbullied!

3048
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,760
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

3049
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,820
Okay, I'm okay.

3050
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:30,960
I'm okay.

3051
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,780
I'm okay, guys.

3052
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,940
What the fuck?

3053
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,800
There's a charge rifle over there.

3054
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,840
I don't... Can you finish that?

3055
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,360
No, I can't.

3056
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,780
Okay, I'll finish them.

3057
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,880
I'll sit here and dock you.

3058
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:50,040
Oh my god, this team is so annoying.

3059
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,220
They are, they are.

3060
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,740
There's three squads, though.

3061
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,840
They are very annoying.

3062
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:56,860
Oh my god.

3063
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,800
I'm scared, Hiro.

3064
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3065
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,580

3066
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,120
Where?

3067
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,920
On the ping.

3068
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,540
On the container.

3069
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,220
We should kill this team.

3070
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,160
Which one?

3071
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:10,620
This team?

3072
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,540
Oh, they're pushing, they're pushing.

3073
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:12,780
Crack, crack, crack, crack.

3074
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:14,720
You got it.

3075
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,100
I got him, I got him, I got him.

3076
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,020
Okay, we can fly.

3077
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,080
That guy is really far.

3078
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,060
He's like over there.

3079
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,060
There's another team.

3080
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,540
Can you thirst him?

3081
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,860
Oh, yeah, here, here.

3082
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:26,680
Where is he?

3083
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,040
Where is he?

3084
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,020
Here, on the ping, on the ping.

3085
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,000
I don't see a ping.

3086
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:30,640
Oh, there he is.

3087
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:30,980
Okay.

3088
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,740
Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking.

3089
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,280
Look at crosses.

3090
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,140
I don't see him.

3091
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,060
Where are they?

3092
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:37,480
Where are they?

3093
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,140
I don't know, I'm looting.

3094
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:39,360
I'm looting?

3095
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,180
He's over here.

3096
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:40,940
I'm over here.

3097
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:41,380
I'm over here.

3098
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,960
Alright, alright, I'm coming over here.

3099
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,160
Wait, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me.

3100
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,060
Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.

01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:46,800
On here, on here.

3102
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,400
Behind this box, behind this box.

3103
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:51,280
I cracked him though.

3104
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:54,300
Broke, broke.

3105
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,520
Nice, I'm crossing.

3106
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:56,620
One hit, one hit, did you?

3107
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:58,600
I knocked.

3108
01:18:59,060 --> 01:18:59,920
Not pass finder.

3109
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,100
I knocked him, I knocked him.

3110
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,880
This one is one too.

3111
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,440
This one is one.

3112
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,400
Yeah, but he's like blocking him for me.

3113
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,260
I got him, I got him.

3114
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,920
Nice, pull it, pull it, pull it.

3115
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:09,660
Right here, right here, right here.

3116
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,140
Oh my god.

3117
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:11,800
Okay.

3118
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:13,140
Okay, okay.

3119
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,100
I got the gaps on...

3120
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,760
Oh, I saw purple, purple, purple armor over here.

3121
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,440
Up top.

3122
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,340
Okay, okay, okay.

3123
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,120
Oh my god.

3124
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,040
I need it.

3125
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:24,740
Oh, we go together?

3126
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,560
Okay, okay, okay.

01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,980
Alright, go Ditto, go!

01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,580
You can't die!

3130
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,800
Crack, crack, crack.

3131
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,080
Oh god, I can't see.

3132
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:39,940
I'm having a watch.

3133
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,440
Red armor, red armor.

3134
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,080
Oh god.

3135
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,540
Okay, I need a backup from that.

3136
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:45,580
Okay.

3137
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,280

01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,360
Okay.

3142
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,360
I'm doing something crazy.

3143
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:01,780
Okay.

3144
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,440
Okay, I have only one battle left.

3145
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,260
Where's one hit Ditto?

3146
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:06,940
Okay.

3147
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:09,420
I have two.

3148
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:09,880
Two in cross.

3149
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:11,800
Okay, nice.

3150
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,200

3151
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,160
I got one, I got one, I got one.

3152
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,420
Okay, inside, inside.

3153

Okay.

01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,060
I will go help, I will go help.

3155
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,760
I got one, I got the other.

3156
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,940
Last guy, last guy, last guy.

3157
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,620
Crack them, I cracked them.

3158
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,640
I want your shit.

3159
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:31,580
Give me your shit.

3160
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:32,800
Yay!

3161
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:34,920
Yay!

3162
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,100
Yay!

3163
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,240
Alright, look at us go.

3164
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,620
We're so good now.

3165
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,080
Where's this guy?

3166
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,540
I almost have no more...

3167
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,720
I don't have ammo.

3168
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,540
We're poor now.

3169
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,120
We're so poor.

3170
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,500
Over there, over there, over there.

3171
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,860
They're coming to us.

3172
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,120
I see him, I see him.

3173
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:55,940
Wait, they also have a bow.

3174
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,220
I need his bow.

3175
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,860
Give me your shit.

3176
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,520
Let me go look at them.

3177
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,620
Be careful here.

3178
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:06,740
It's a rampart.

3179
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,300
Let me, let me.

3180
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:08,920
I'm gonna EMP them in a bit.

3181
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,880
My drone is coming back.

3182
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:12,940
Okay.

3183
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,620
I'm getting on the roof.

3184
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,820
Okay, I just got my...

3185
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,280
Oh, I got one hundred with my main.

3186
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:18,940
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3187
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:21,260
Careful.

3188
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,380
Get the rampart away.

3189
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:24,060
I'm doing it now.

3190
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,580
I'm slowly heading over.

3191
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,280
Alright.

3192
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,280
Be careful.

3193
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,340
I got knocked.

3194
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,280
You got knocked?

3195
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,640
Alright, alright.

3196
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:37,960
Back out.

3197
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,920
Can you keep crawling back to me?

3198
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:40,820
Crawl back to us.

3199
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,540
I think I can't.

3200
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,280
Oh no.

3201
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:45,700
Okay, okay.

3202
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,820
You cover, you cover.

3203
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,100
I'm gonna go grab her.

3204
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,040
Yeah, I'm okay.

3205
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,980
I have to, I actually have to bat.

3206
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:52,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3207
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,160
You should.

3208
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,920
Oh, they're getting crossed.

3209
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,000
They're getting across right now.

3210
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:01,040
Oh, they see me heading.

3211
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:01,900
Cover, cover, cover.

3212
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,940
She, she, there's a...

3213
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,160
Maybe you have...

3214
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:06,400
Yeah, yeah.

3215
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:07,700
You have to kill them first.

3216
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,300
I got it.

3217
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:11,080
I got it, I got it.

3218
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,060
Oh, they killed me.

3219
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:14,380
Oh, no.

3220
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:15,760
He got you.

3221
01:22:16,340 --> 01:22:16,980
Wait, wait, wait.

3222
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:17,700
Keep coming back.

3223
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,180
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.

3224
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,100
But I need you to cover though.

3225
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:20,580
Okay, okay, okay.

3226
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,120
You can do it, you can do it.

3227
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,920
Okay, they have... I think this is one...

3228
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,460
It's a solo and then this team.

3229
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,220
Yeah, solo and...

3230
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,180
This is bad.

3231
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:31,200
They're on me, they're on me.

3232
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:31,860
The solo's on me.

3233
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,120
No, this is a...

3234
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:36,000
No, no, no.

3235
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,980
All on me, all on me.

3236
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,020
It's a solo.

3237
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,740
All on me, all on me.

3238
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,680
Pass me that, pass me that.

3239
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,540
One knock, one knock.

3240
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,560
And one, another one with heal.

3241
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,500
I don't know where he is.

3242
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:46,660
He's here.

3243
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:46,860
Okay.

3244
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,700
I got him.

3245
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:49,380
Flash, flash, flash.

3246
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,020
I got him, I got him.

3247
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,120
Nice, nice.

3248
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:52,260
I need to cover.

3249
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:52,960
Oh, shit.

3250
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:53,580
That's a solo.

3251
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:55,980
It's okay, okay, okay.

3252
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:56,920
Okay.

3253
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,000
Okay.

3254
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,080
Wait, they're not solo.

3255
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:03,000
This isn't solo.

3256
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,020
This is not a solo?

3257
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,300
It's not a solo, Doki.

3258
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:08,940
It's not a solo.

3259
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,880
It's a full team just waiting.

3260
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,980
Full team ratting.

3261
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,000
Please die!

3262
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,380
I almost got him too!

3263
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,020
It's a full team ratting!

3264
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,820
It's a full team ratting!

3265
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:23,500
Cowards!

3266
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,380
They had to look for cowards!

3267
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,580
Holy shit!

3268
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,440
Oh my god!

3269
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,440
I can't believe the full team ratting!

3270
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:34,720
Oh my god!

3271
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,480
And they, and they, they lose.

3272
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:38,660
They lose the lifeline.

3273
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,560
They lost!

3274
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,880
I can't kill.

3275
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,360
I can't believe it.

3276
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:47,900
I can't believe it.

3277
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:48,680
Nice.

3278
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,980
I can't believe a full team ratting!

3279
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,220
We were like, mowing down.

3280
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:00,000
We killed everybody in this team ratting.

3281
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:01,840
We were like, mowing down.

3282
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,040
I was like, wait, that's not one person.

3283
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:04,840
I was like, wait, that's not one person.

3284
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,240
Wait, didn't we each quit again?

3285
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,400
I got Daisy.

3286
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:10,900
I got Daisy.

3287
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,680
Oh, yeah, DC, DC, DC.

3288
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,520
Yes, yeah.

3289
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,800
Do you wanna be leader?

3290
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,300
Do you wanna be leader?

3291
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,260
No, no, no.

3292
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,140
I can't join.

3293
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:23,520
Why?

3294
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,100
I can't join anyone.

3295
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,300
I invited it.

3296
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,360
I invited it.

3297
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:33,580
I will play Horizon because Password is too high.

3298
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:34,860
Password is too high.

3299
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,140
It's too hard?

3300
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,300
Yeah.

3301
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:42,260
I got handshot with that bossing.

3302
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,120
Oh no.

3303
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,980
Oh no.

3304
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,060
Yeah, I mean his hitbox is like bigger.

3305
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,700
His hitbox is bigger.

3306
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,940
It's okay, this time.

3307
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,080
This time, you won't die.

3308
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:56,060
I believe.

3309
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,380
Yeah, Hiro, do you believe?

3310
01:24:58,680 --> 01:24:59,660
Do you believe in Ditto?

3311
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,080
I believe.

3312
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,600
Ditto got 1v3 this time.

3313
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:08,960
Yeah, Ditto, you're gonna 1v3.

3314
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:09,700
Why?

3315
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,360
Why you guys want me to 1v2?

3316
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,280
Because you're prent!

3317
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,980
You're so cool.

3318
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,500
You can't do.

3319
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,320
Ditto, I 1v3'd.

3320
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,320
Where was your last game?

3321
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,800
I literally 1v3'd.

3322
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,940
What do you mean?

3323
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,920
You played 2.

3324
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,300
Yeah, and I 1v3'd.

3325
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,700
Where was your 1v3?

3326
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,700
Yeah?

3327
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,480
Yeah?

3328
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:35,620
Ditto?

3329
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,340
What?

3330
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,320
Ditto, where was your 1v3?

3331
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:44,980
I just 1v3'd last game.

3332
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:46,860
Which game?

3333
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:47,720
Last game!

3334
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,320
I literally 1v3'd last game.

3335
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,540
No, you didn't.

3336
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:52,940
You didn't.

3337
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:54,760
What do you mean?

3338
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,200
You killed that lifeline.

3339
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,520
Oh, sorry.

3340
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,420
I didn't.

3341
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,760
Which one?

3342
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:03,540
I killed 3 people in the caustic.

3343
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,800
You killed 2.

3344
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,340
I killed 3.

3345
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,980
I killed 2 and I damaged...

3346
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:10,160
I broke 1 armor.

3347
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,260
Alright, Ditto.

3348
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,700
Your turn to 1v3.

3349
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,260
Did you just hit 1v3?

3350
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,020
I'm not saving your life anymore, Ditto.

3351
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:27,800
No!

3352
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,240
Remember the bridge?

3353
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,040
The bridge!

3354
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,500
I saved your life.

3355
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,860
The bridge.

3356
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,940
No, I did not 1v3.

3357
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,060
What do you mean?

3358
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,260
I killed... I saved your life.

3359
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,800
I killed 2 and I let you knock the 3rd.

3360
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,240
I killed 2 and I let you knock the 3rd.

3361
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,800
Ditto was just here to watch.

3362
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:53,300
Naughty.

3363
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,380
Who's right?

3364
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,560
If I say anything...

3365
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,660
They're gonna turn on me.

3366
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,580
I was scared.

3367
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:05,100
.... Подuesta västeruffy.

3368
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:10,200
dormanок No, you gaslighted me again.

3369
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,920
You lied.

3370
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,760
You're gaslighting me.

3371
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,120
I know what I did.

3372
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,100
I know what I did.

3373
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,620
Last match?

3374
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,080
Yes.

3375
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,100
I did.

3376
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,600
Wait, is somebody there, Doki?

3377
01:27:25,660 --> 01:27:27,560
I did a 1v3.

3378
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:28,060
It's time.

3379
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,400
It's time.

3380
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,180
It's time.

3381
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,800
She's actually there.

3382
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:35,740
Wait, watch this.

3383
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,120
Two together?

3384
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,620
Inside the building?

3385
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,580
Doki can do it.

3386
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:40,780
Not together?

3387
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,260
Oh my

3388
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,840
god.

3389
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,740
Down one?

3390
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:51,780
He's low.

3391
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:53,580
Nice.

3392
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,060
I down one.

3393
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:55,960
I'm here.

3394
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:56,060
I'm here.

3395
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:57,260
Flash.

3396
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:58,180
Flash.

3397
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:58,460
Flash.

3398
01:27:58,460 --> 01:27:58,800
Flash.

3399
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,120
I hit like 80.

3400
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:01,520
Yeah.

3401
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:03,840
Hero 1v3.

3402
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:05,520
Hero 1v3.

3403
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,660
You guys play together.

3404
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:10,820
I will just watch.

3405
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,620
I will just watch you guys watch.

3406
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,280
1v2 people?

3407
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:14,640
Okay.

3408
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:15,660
What do you mean?

3409
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:17,060
Where's your 1v3?

3410
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:18,580
Why?

3411
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,760
Why not?

3412
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,780
Why do I have to play?

3413
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,900
If you guys can 1v2 every team?

3414
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:29,000
Because we gotta show everybody that we can each individually 1v3.

3415
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,520
I can.

3416
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,920
I can 1v3.

3417
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:33,900
Then show me.

3418
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,260
Where's the enemy?

3419
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,040
Where's the enemy?

3420
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:40,600
Next enemy.

3421
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:41,160
Okay.

3422
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,300
You're getting that one.

3423
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,880
I can actually sound here by the way.

3424
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:45,540
Oh yeah.

3425
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,660
Why do we have to 1v2 people?

3426
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:51,560
We have 3 people.

3427
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,540
Why do you have to play solo?

3428
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,780
Because each of us needs to show that we're good at the game.

3429
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:57,120
Okay?

3430
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:03,600
And we wanna prove that people... We're actually fighting really hard right now.

3431
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,040
Yeah.

3432
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,860
And we wanna prove to people that we are a Pred girl squad.

3433
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:10,480
We each have the 1v3 at least once a day.

3434
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,000
Wait.

3435
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:12,780
He's right here.

3436
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,280
He's right here.

3437
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:13,480
He's right here.

3438
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:13,860
Ditto.

3439
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:14,080
Ditto.

3440
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:14,480
It's time.

3441
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,500
Don't help her.

3442
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:15,880
It's time.

3443
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:16,520
Okay.

3444
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:16,900
Okay.

3445
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:17,240
Okay.

3446
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:18,840
I'll scan for you Ditto.

3447
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:19,440
Here we go.

3448
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:19,640
Yeah.

3449
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:19,720
Yeah.

3450
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:19,860
Yeah.

3451
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,700
We scan for you.

3452
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:22,660
Another one?

3453
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:24,060
Yes.

3454
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:24,560
Only one.

3455
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,340
You see it?

3456
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:26,500
Wait.

3457
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:26,740
He's coming.

3458
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:27,740
It's a bottom.

3459
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:28,000
Yeah.

3460
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,200
Yeah.

3461
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:28,320
Yeah.

3462
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:29,300
Look.

3463
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,120
I'm following him.

3464
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:30,560
There he is.

3465
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,160
I'm following him.

3466
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:32,920
No.

3467
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,520
I killed one team.

3468
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,140
You did it Ditto.

3469
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,580
I did it.

3470
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:40,900
I did it.

3471
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,380
I did it.

3472
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:45,400
One only.

3473
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:45,840
One only.

3474
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,840
You keep killing one.

3475
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:48,380
Yes.

3476
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:48,560
Yes.

3477
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:48,840
Here.

3478
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:49,060
Here.

3479
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:49,300
Here.

3480
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,100
There's another butthole here too.

3481
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,100
There's only one guy here.

3482
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:53,820
Go.

3483
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:55,500
Go.

3484
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:55,620
Go.

3485
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:55,900
Go.

3486
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:56,380
Go Ditto.

3487
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:56,580
Go.

3488
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:57,820
No.

3489
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:58,140
No.

3490
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:58,520
Oh wait.

3491
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,020
Another team.

3492
01:29:59,060 --> 01:29:59,360
Not the team.

3493
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,240
I dropped down.

3494
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:00,680
I dropped down.

3495
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,160
I dropped down.

3496
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:02,460
I cracked him.

3497
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:02,960
I cracked him.

3498
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,280
It's the same team.

3499
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:04,980
It's the same team.

3500
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,500
That's his teammate.

3501
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:07,360
Okay.

3502
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:07,680
I'm gonna loot.

3503
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:07,780
No.

3504
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,620
This is a different team.

3505
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:08,980
Yeah.

3506
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:09,680
This is a different team.

3507
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:12,180
It's okay.

3508
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:12,540
Army.

3509
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:12,880
Army.

3510
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,040
Army.

3511
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:14,640
I'm here.

3512
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:15,420
Wait.

3513
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,240
They're here.

3514
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:16,720
Yeah.

3515
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:16,860
They're here.

3516
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:17,200
Almost can.

3517
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:17,980
Almost can.

3518
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,040
Oh my god.

3519
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:19,380
He's cracked.

3520
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:20,320
He's cracked.

3521
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,020
I will kill them.

3522
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:22,800
Ditto you can do it.

3523
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:23,860
Ditto you can do it.

3524
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,340
If you kill two that's a 1v3.

3525
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,020
He's so low that guy.

3526
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,880
He's so low.

3527
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,400
The lifeline.

3528
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:34,260
Oh my god.

3529
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:34,940
He's coming out the car.

3530
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:35,840
There's one guy here.

3531
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,260
I got him low Ditto.

3532
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:38,880
I got him low.

3533
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:40,100
I got him low.

3534
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:40,920
I got the Bloodhound low.

3535
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,140
It's your turn 1v3.

3536
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:42,920
He's so low.

3537
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:43,520
He's so low.

3538
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:43,920
He's so low.

3539
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,640
Now you need two more.

3540
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,240
One more.

3541
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:48,760
One more Ditto.

3542
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,020
One more.

3543
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,760
I broke it.

3544
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,680
I broke it for you Ditto.

3545
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,280
1v3.

3546
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,180
1v3.

3547
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:54,540
Yeah.

3548
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:00,760
We did it.

3549
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:02,040
We did it.

3550
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:02,720
1v3.

3551
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:03,060
Okay.

3552
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:03,700
Okay.

3553
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,680
We did it.

3554
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:06,140
1v3.

3555
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:06,500
Yeah.

3556
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,720
Guys we're good at this game.

3557
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,040
We each can 1v3.

3558
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,060
Each of us can 1v3 guys.

3559
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,180
We're a pro squad.

3560
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:16,980
Oh my god.

3561
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:17,840
Another squad.

3562
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,280
Another squad.

3563
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,720
Here I'll EMP them.

3564
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,560
Go Doki.

3565
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,380
You can do it.

3566
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:24,900
Now we can play as a team.

3567
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,380
Now we can play as a team.

3568
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:26,820
Okay.

3569
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:27,480
As a team.

3570
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:27,720
Okay.

3571
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:32,740
We play as a team and show everyone how we're good as a team.

3572
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,780
Now that we show everyone how we're good individually.

3573
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:38,040
Now we show people how we're good as a team.

3574
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:38,440
Now we show people how we're good as a team.

3575
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:38,440
Okay.

3576
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:38,940

3577
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:39,380

3579
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:39,740

3580
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:39,900
Enemy.

3581
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:41,880
Wait.

3582
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,280
There's another team behind us.

3583
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:44,300
Go.

3584
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:44,760
Go.

3585
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:44,900
Go.

3586
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,160
Yes.

3587
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:46,600
There's one.

3588
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,440
There's an Ashe.

3589
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,280
There's an Ashe back over here.

3590
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:51,660
There's an Ashe back over here.

3591
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:53,020
They did a knife thing.

3592
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:53,880
It's Kondoid.

3593
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,520
It's Kondoid.

3594
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:55,780
He's white armor.

3595
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:56,480
He's white armor.

3596
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:57,560
Yeah.

3597
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:58,140
I broke him.

3598
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:58,600
Don't worry.

3599
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,960
I will follow him.

3600
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:00,460
Yeah.

3601
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,260
We follow him.

3602
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:02,760
Follow him.

3603
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:03,200
Follow him.

3604
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,120
Don't let him run.

3605
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:05,600
You know what?

3606
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,760
I'm gonna jump tower.

3607
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:07,340
Yeah.

3608
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,340
You're so far from us.

3609
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:11,680
He's so low.

3610
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,460
Really low.

3611
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:12,960
He's here.

3612
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,340
He's here.

3613
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:13,720
He's here.

3614
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:14,760
I'm running.

3615
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:15,120
I'm running.

3616
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:15,440
I'm running.

3617
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,000
He's here.

3618
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:16,720
Okay.

3619
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:17,520
Okay.

3620
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:19,960
How low is he?

3621
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:21,560
He's dead.

3622
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:22,040
Wait.

3623
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:22,620
He has a team.

3624
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:23,460
Wait.

3625
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:23,640
Wait.

3626
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,240
I'm gonna finish him.

3627
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:24,980
I'm gonna finish him.

3628
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:25,600
I'm gonna finish him.

3629
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:27,320
Where's your team?

3630
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:27,460
Okay.

3631
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:27,980
Okay.

3632
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:28,120
Okay.

3633
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:29,960
Where's your team?

3634
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,440
Wait.

3635
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:30,920
They're resting.

3636
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,240
They have a team.

3637
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:33,880
Okay.

3638
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:34,660
They're resting.

3639
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:35,180
Okay.

3640
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:35,320
They're resting.

3641
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:35,320
Okay.

3642
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,160
I will go back.

3643
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:36,700
Okay.

3644
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,020
Okay.

3645
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:37,260
Okay.

3646
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:37,760
I'm scared.

3647
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:38,400
Oh.

3648
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,220
What the f***?

3649
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,240
Wait.

3650
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,000
I got snared.

3651
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,200
Yeah.

3652
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,120
They snared you.

3653
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:46,020
Come here.

3654
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:46,240
Come here.

3655
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,020
It's Ashe.

3656
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:47,640
Wait.

3657
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,320
Did he throw that all the way from there?

3658
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:50,600
Is that Ashe?

3659
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:51,260
White armor.

3660
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:51,820
White armor.

3661
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:53,320
Keep up here.

3662
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,080
It's Ashe.

3663
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:55,600
Yeah.

3664
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:58,340
He f***ing snared me all the way back here.

3665
01:32:58,620 --> 01:32:59,100
He's here.

3666
01:32:59,120 --> 01:32:59,500
He's here.

3667
01:32:59,560 --> 01:32:59,920

3672
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:02,180
Here.

3673
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,180
He has to come to me.

3674
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:04,000
Watch this.

3675
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:04,860
Wait.

3676
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,120

3677
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:06,980
Oh.

3678
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:08,460
Wait.

3679
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,340
That's a good ult.

3680
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:09,720
Wait.

3681
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:09,860
Wait.

3682
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:10,940
Another one here.

3683
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:11,740
Another one here.

3684
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:13,220
Another one here.

3685
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,140
Here.

3686
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:14,380

3687
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:14,460
Here.

3688
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,380
Okay.

3689
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:17,980
Oh.

3690
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:18,420
Ashe.

3691
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,200
You made a mistake.

3692
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:19,860
Okay.

3693
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:21,020
I feel his teammate.

3694
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:22,960
I made a mistake.

3695
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:23,840
He's over there.

3696
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,440
I waited too long.

3697
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,680
Where is he?

3698
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,760
He ran.

3699
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,500
He ran this way.

3700
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:33,360
Go kill them.

3701
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,600
I'm running.

3702
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,400
Let me check for you.

3703
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,380
Yeah.

3704
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:37,460
Yeah.

3705
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:37,840
Yeah.

3706
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,840
Where did he go?

3707
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,840
He doesn't have his ult anymore.

3708
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:45,960
He's here.

3709
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:46,340
He's here.

3710
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,360
He's so far.

3711
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:49,960
He's just too far.

3712
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:50,780
No.

3713
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:51,880
I'm gonna chase him.

3714
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,420
You can't run away from me.

3715
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:53,900
Okay.

3716
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,820
I think we can go zone.

3717
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,480
You guys go left side.

3718
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,360
And cut him off.

3719
01:33:59,060 --> 01:33:59,380
Yeah.

3720
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,060
You guys cut him off.

3721
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,600
He has to go here.

3722
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,780
He has to rotate here.

3723
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,300
I think...

3724
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:09,660
I think he's gonna carve his teammate banner again.

3725
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,400
Did they have a crafter for him?

3726
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,160
Oh.

3727
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:13,600
Wait.

3728
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,300

I'll craft it.

3756
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:37,720
I'll craft it.

3757
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:38,740
I'll craft it.

3758
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:39,280
It's okay.

3759
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,500
It's okay.

3765
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:45,280
I fucked up.

3766
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,600
What happened?

3767
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,360
What happened?

3768
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,460
I got hunted.

3769
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,760
I got hunted.

3770
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,060
Wait.

3771
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:54,260
Full squad.

3772
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,000
Full squad.

3773
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:56,380
Yeah.

3774
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,260
That was a full squad.

3775
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:57,460
Here.

3776
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:57,680
Here.

3777
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:57,880
Here.

3778
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,060
Wait.

3779
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:01,660
They're fighting, Dido.

3780
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:02,260
Okay.

3781
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,360
Fighting with me.

3782
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,320
They're fighting with me.

3783
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,480
Fighting with me.

3784
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,520
Maybe we have to go there.

3785
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:12,320
You know what?

3786
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,540
I'll EMP them for you, Dido.

3787
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:14,700
Oh, yeah.

3788
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,440
We can do it.

3789
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:15,860
We can do it.

3790
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,400
Okay.

3791
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:17,020
Are we fighting?

3792
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:17,500
Are we fighting?

3793
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,120
Are you on a fight?

3794
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:18,720
You're on a fight?

3795
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,400
Yeah.

3796
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,040
Alright.

3797
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,440
We're gonna fight in zone then.

3798
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:21,720
Yeah.

3799
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,060
Here.

3800
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:22,340
Here.

3801
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:22,580
Here.

3802
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:24,600
Alright.

3803
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:25,720
I'm heading over.

3804
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,620
I cracked one.

3805
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,900
I don't have an angle.

3806
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:30,620
She's there?

3807
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,240
Yeah.

3808
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:31,720
I see them.

3809
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,060
I see them.

3810
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:32,380
I see them.

3811
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,440
You use your horizon Q.

3812
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,040
I'm gonna...

3813
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:35,860
Nice.

3814
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:38,100
Flash.

3815
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:38,220
Flash.

3816
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:38,660
One's flash.

3817
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:39,060
One's flash.

3818
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,460
Yeah.

3819
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:43,240
There's one's almost low.

3820
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:46,980
I got one.

3821
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:47,280
I got one.

3822
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:48,800
All dead.

3823
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,160
All dead.

3824
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:49,520
All dead.

3825
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:49,920
Nice.

3826
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:49,940
Nice.

3827
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:49,940
Nice.

3828
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:49,940
See?

3829
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,080
We did it as a team.

3830
01:35:52,140 --> 01:35:52,580
Okay.

3831
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,900
We're good as a team and individual.

3832
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:56,520
Guys.

3833
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:56,940
See?

3834
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,060
It's kinda painful.

3835
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:00,840
Oh, shit.

3836
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,040
Wait.

3837
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,000
Wait a minute.

3838
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,140
What they have a...

3839
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,360
Wait a minute.

3840
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:04,760
Wait.

3841
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,460
Do you have a... Do you have a heat shield?

3842
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,020
Yeah.

3843
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:08,500
Yeah.

3844
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,180
I have heat shield.

3845
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:09,600
Yes, I do.

3846
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:10,660
Wait.

3847
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:11,820
Oh my god.

3848
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,660
You both so far from each other.

3849
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:15,400
Oh my god.

3850
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:15,400
You both so far from each other.

3851
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:15,660
Wait.

3852
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:17,140
Wait.

3853
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,440
Oh, wait.

3854
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,080
I'm lagging.

3855
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:21,820
I'm lagging.

3856
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:23,800
Are you lagging?

3857
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:26,840
Are you lagging?

3858
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,220
I'm lagging.

3859
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,580
Oh my god.

3860
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,300
That was lagging.

3861
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,260
Wait.

3862
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:35,980
The zone hurts, guys.

3863
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,120
What is that?

3864
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,200
Guys.

3865
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,760
I'm lagging.

3866
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,720
The zone hurts.

3867
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:43,540
So far, it's not good.

3868
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:45,460
Oh, no.

3869
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,040
Oh, no.

3870
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:48,580
Oh my god.

3871
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,500
The zone hurts.

3872
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,200
The zone really hurts.

3873
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:50,460
Yeah.

3874
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,820
The zone really hurts.

3875
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,160
Wait.

3876
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:52,720
So far.

3877
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,680
We don't have a...

3878
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:54,260
Oh my god.

3879
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,300
We don't have a jump tower.

3880
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,280
I have only one heat shield.

3881
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:03,580
And Doki, she's using heat shield for herself.

3882
01:37:03,820 --> 01:37:03,840
And Doki, she's using heat shield for herself.

3883
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:04,260
I'm dying.

3884
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,340
I only have...

3885
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:05,780
I have one...

3886
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:06,880
Yeah.

3887
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,560
Yeah.

3888
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:07,680
Yeah.

3889
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,000
I have one lip too.

3890
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,020
Oh, no.

3891
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:11,580
I might die.

3892
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,040
I might die before I could head over.

3893
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:13,720
Wait.

3894
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:14,860
Did I... Oh my god.

3895
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:15,740
I don't have heals.

3896
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:16,600
Wait.

3897
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,020
I'm gonna die.

3898
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:19,780
Oh, no.

3899
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,240
Oh my god.

3900
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:21,720
Heal.

3901
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,700
I'm so close.

3902
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:28,100
I'll give you a little bit of heal.

3903
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:28,720
Wait.

3904
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,480
I don't have a heal.

3905
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,200
Okay.

3906
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:30,740
Go.

3907
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:31,900
It's fine.

3908
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:32,800
It's fine.

3909
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:34,440
Heal first.

3910
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:34,800
Heal.

3911
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,800
30 seconds.

3912
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:37,640
I made it.

3913
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:38,060
I made it.

3914
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:38,500
I made it.

3915
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,880
Goodbye, guys.

3916
01:37:40,220 --> 01:37:41,120
You're so dead.

3917
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,100
You're so dead.

3918
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:42,520
I'm dead.

3919
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:44,160
You're so dead.

3920
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,280
Goodbye, everybody.

3921
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:47,160
Are they there?

3922
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,000
Oh, I don't know.

3923
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:49,740
But I'm running.

3924
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:51,240
Okay.

3925
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:53,640
I don't know.

3926
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,680
But I'm running.

3927
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,740
I need it.

3928
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:57,920
Oh my god.

3929
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:58,840
I need it in the zone.

3930
01:37:59,500 --> 01:37:59,920
Guys.

3931
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:00,360
Oh, fuck.

3932
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,500
Oh my gosh.

3933
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:01,960
Yeah.

3934
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:02,460
Yeah.

3935
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,140
The zone's hurt.

3936
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,140
Am I gonna make it?

3937
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,140
Am I gonna make it?

3938
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:06,220
I don't know.

3939
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,580
Oh, okay.

3940
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,060
Heal or not.

3941
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,240
Heal or not.

3942
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:11,980
Wait.

3943
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:13,360
There's a Wraith in front of us.

3944
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:13,500
I'm running.

3945
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:14,920
There's a Wraith.

3946
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:15,320
There's a Wraith.

3947
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:17,000
It's okay.

3948
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:17,380
It's okay.

3949
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:18,560
I'm looking.

3950
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:18,880
I'm looking.

3951
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:20,160
Team here.

3952
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:20,680
Team here.

3953
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:21,320
Okay.

3954
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:21,600
Okay.

3955
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:21,840
Okay.

3956
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,020
I think we go.

3957
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:23,400
We go.

3958
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:24,040
We go left.

3959
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:24,520
Just...

3960
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:24,920
Yeah.

3961
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:25,380
Full left.

3962
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:25,740
Full left.

3963
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,380
I'll go to you.

3964
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,240
Yeah.

3965
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,380
But there's a Wraith right here, though.

3966
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:31,280
Okay.

3967
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,140
We have to go right then.

3968
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:33,920
No.

3969
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:35,180
One team on the right.

3970
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:36,220
We go here.

3971
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:36,660
We go here.

3972
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,360
Okay.

3973
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:38,220
Okay.

3974
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:38,440
Okay.

3975
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,780
We can go from the...

3976
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,180
We can go from the bottom.

3977
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:43,540
Yeah.

3978
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:43,700
Yeah.

3979
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:43,900
Yeah.

3980
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:44,000
Yeah.

3981
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:46,480
They're over here.

3982
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:46,900
They're over here.

3983
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,420
They're over here.

3984
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:47,980
That's okay.

3985
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,120
They don't see us.

3986
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,700
They don't see us, but they saw me.

3987
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,080
They saw me.

3988
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:54,480
It's okay.

3989
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:54,860
It's okay.

3990
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:55,540
Be careful here.

3991
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,820
I have... I have Q.

3992
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,420
I have Q.

3993
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:57,740
I have Q.

3994
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:00,660
Guys.

3995
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:01,940
Guys.

3996
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:02,340
Guys.

3997
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:03,300
Guys.

3998
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:03,660
Guys.

3999
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:04,920
Guys, this is bad.

4000
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,280
This is... Oh.

4001
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,080
Oh, God.

4002
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:07,480
Guys.

4003
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:09,340
Okay.

4004
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,540
They got 2.

4005
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,000
They got 2.

4006
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,240
They got 3B.

4007
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:13,780
They got 3B.

4008
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,460
We are okay, we are okay, we are so healthy.

4009
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,740
We are good, we are good.

4010
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,600
Stay here, stay here, this is safe, this is safe.

4011
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,360
Oh my god.

4012
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,720
It's okay, we are so safe.

4013
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,280
We go down, okay?

4014
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,620
We are okay, we are okay.

4015
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4016
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:31,760
What the fuck, who came here?

4017
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,000
Do you want to go down?

4018
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:38,700
Okay, I want his armor.

4019
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:40,780
We are okay.

4020
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,720
We are okay, we are okay, we are okay.

4021
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,240
I see him coming.

4022
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,500
Where?

4023
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,200
He's more, Kev.

4024
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,240
I'm coming over, I'm coming over, I'm Qing.

4025
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,120
I dropped one.

4026
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:54,280
Wait, I dropped down too.

4027
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:54,780
No!

4028
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,000
Tito!

4029
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:03,170
Kev, he's Kev, he's Kev.

4030
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:05,170
Kev, we can't get up, no, they are rezzing.

4031
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:06,490
He's rezzing, he's rezzing.

4032
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:07,890
Go, go, go.

4033
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:11,150
He rezzed, he rezzed, he rezzed.

4034
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:13,610
In the, in the...

4035
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:14,430
Crack, crack, crack.

4036
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:14,910
You have to hit.

4037
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:16,390
Okay, okay.

4038
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:17,170
He's low, he's low.

4039
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:17,950
He's down?

4040
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:21,290
Zone, zone, zone, we run, we run, we run!

4041
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,150
Zone, zone, zone!

4042
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:24,550
Zone hurts, zone hurts!

4043
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:27,370
Leave him, leave him, leave him, the zone hurts!

4044
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:28,470
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4045
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:30,870
I will cut off my armor.

4046
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:32,850
I need a battery.

4047
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:33,970
The zone hurts!

4048
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:35,990
Okay, okay.

4049
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:38,210
I will get keeping them.

4050
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:39,890
Yeah, we can keep, we can keep.

4051
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,770
Okay, I will get keep later.

4052
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:43,650
Yeah, they have to die.

4053
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:45,290
They are not dead yet.

4054
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:46,910
They have to die, they have to die here.

4055
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:49,950
There's no way.

4056
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:51,570
Wait, they have a...

4057
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:52,550
Wait, they have a...

4058
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:55,890
They are going to die, they are going to die anyway.

4059
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:57,290
Yeah, they are going to die, they are going to die.

4060
01:40:57,290 --> 01:40:58,390
Yeah, they are going to die taking that.

4061
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:01,010
Be careful.

4062
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:01,730
Are they?

4063
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:03,790
Where?

4064
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:04,610
Where are they?

4065
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:06,610
Where did they go?

4066
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:08,970
Wait, there is someone here?

4067
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:09,950
Where did they go?

4068
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:10,510
Wait, he is Kraber?

4069
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:11,730
No?

4070
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:12,890
Are they...

4071
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:13,670
They died?

4072
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:13,990
No?

4073
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:14,530
No!

4074
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:15,010
What?

4075
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:17,010
I didn't... I didn't...

4076
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:19,210
I don't get a kill.

4077
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:20,450
Yeah, I don't get a kill too.

4078
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:21,070
Where did they go?

4079
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:23,190
They lived?

4080
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:24,870
What?

4081
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:27,950
Oh no, they got... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4082
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:28,810
We got to the zone.

4083
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:29,290
Nice, nice.

4084
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:30,090
Wow!

4085
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:31,530
Nice!

4086
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:32,550
Where is Gibby all?

4087
01:41:33,150 --> 01:41:34,010
Kraber, Kraber here!

4088
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,370
There is a Gibby all in front of me.

4089
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:37,110
Be careful, be careful, be careful.

4090
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:39,750
I know, I know, but there is a Gibby all in front of me.

4091
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:41,310
Yeah, but...

4092
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:42,630
They dead, they dead.

4093
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:43,290
They all dead.

4094
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:44,910
No, no, no, no, we didn't get a kill.

4095
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:48,330
I get... I got a kill, I got a kill.

4096
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:48,870
You did, you did.

4097
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:49,530
Oh, what?

4098
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:50,210
I got two kills.

4099
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:51,530
Oh, you got two kills.

4100
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:51,990
What the...

4101
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:53,110
Oh, they come to me!

4102
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:55,090
They come to you?

4103
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:55,510
Okay.

4104
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:58,590
Oh, there was solo.

4105
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:00,150
That was...

4106
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:00,650
There was solo.

4107
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:03,810
Okay, I am here, I am here.

4108
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:04,750
They push us, they push us.

4109
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:05,330
Be careful.

4110
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:07,670
I am going up, I am going up.

4111
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:09,230
No, that's me, that's me.

4112
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:09,970
I was on first floor.

4113
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:12,270
Can you kill for me, Hitoki?

4114
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:13,650
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4115
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:14,770
Thank you.

4116
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:16,930
Now we are on 2v2.

4117
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:18,310
They have Kraber.

4118
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:19,710
Where are they?

4119
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:20,050
Where are they?

4120
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:21,230
I have EMP.

4121
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:22,690
Over here, over here.

4122
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:25,510
Almost dead.

4123
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:27,390
Over here.

4124
01:42:28,170 --> 01:42:28,430
Okay.

4125
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:31,790
There is like a...

4126
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:33,270
There is solo over there too.

4127
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:34,350
Okay.

4128
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:36,250
I want to kill solo.

4129
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:37,310
Oh.

4130
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,730
If we crack, we can push.

4131
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:40,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4132
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,570
Wait, you want our EMP?

4133
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:43,930
Oh, yeah, yeah.

4134
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,150
This guy is solo over there.

4135
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:48,930
Your EMP, I will kill up.

4136
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:50,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4137
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:51,170
We are heading over, we are heading over.

4138
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:51,310
Okay.

4139
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,650
I will kill up, I will kill up.

4140
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:54,470
Yeah, I am right here, I am with you.

4141
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,030
Weeeeee.

4142
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:01,330
He is right below us?

4143
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:03,230
Yeah, on the third floor.

4144
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:04,750
I am not there.

4145
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:07,070
Whoa, that guy is solo.

4146
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:07,850
That guy, right here.

4147
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:08,590
Okay.

4148
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,090
Oh, with me, with me, with me.

4149
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:12,110
I am coming, I am coming, I am coming.

4150
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:13,470
Nice.

4151
01:43:13,470 --> 01:43:14,310
Thirst him, Thirst him, Thirst him.

4152
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:14,670
Okay.

4153
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:16,610
I got the bat, I got the bat, I got the bat.

4154
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:17,210
Thirst him, Thirst him.

4155
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:19,850
Where is his teammate?

4156
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:23,150
Here, here, here.

4157
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:24,650
I am pushing.

4158
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:25,230
Okay, let's go.

4159
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:26,630
On here, on here, on here.

4160
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:29,050
Not.

4161
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,230
Last guy here, last guy.

4162
01:43:32,270 --> 01:43:32,770
That is the creeper guy.

4163
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:34,350
I am pushing.

4164
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:34,690
Okay.

4165
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:35,450
I will punish you.

4166
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,390
Punch him, punch him, punch him.

4167
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:38,750
Punch him, punch him, punch him.

4168
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:39,950
Punch him.

4169
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:41,710
Guys, guys.

4170
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:47,170
Yay!

4171
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:50,310
Look, we won V3 that entire game.

4172
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:52,990
And also, we played as a team.

4173
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:53,510
We punch.

4174
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:54,870
We punch, yeah.

4175
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:02,650
Girlfriends, girlfriends.

4176
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:08,150
We are the cootie squad.

4177
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:09,350
Three kills.

4178
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:12,110
Twenty kills.

4179
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:15,130
We did twenty kills again.

4180
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:15,810
Let's go.

4181
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:17,770
We are the cootie squad.

4182
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:19,370
We touch them and they die.

4183
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:20,990
Oh my god.

4184
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:24,010
Yeah, yeah.

4185
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:25,290
We are the cootie squad.

4186
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:29,170
Cootie squad.

4187
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,010
We have cooties actually.

4188
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,430
Yeah, we have cooties.

4189
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:38,970
You don't want to get touched by us.

4190
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:40,030
We all have cooties.

4191
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:41,230
Yeah, we all have cooties.

4192
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,730
When we shoot a person, they die.

4193
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:45,430
That's why we punch them all together.

4194
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:48,690
We gave him extra cooties.

4195
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:52,990
Because we touched him.

4196
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:54,810
Yeah.

4197
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:57,270
Yeah, punches is like more...

4198
01:44:58,410 --> 01:44:59,150
It's more fun.

4199
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:01,030
You die faster.

4200
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:06,910
God, skin to skin contact.

4201
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:07,350
Is it?

4202
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:11,290
Skin contact.

4203
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,730
Cooties are always fatal, guys.

4204
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:18,890
But we make it faster when we punch you.

4205
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:20,710
When you get punched, it's like...

4206
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,430
It's like you die in one day.

4207
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,370
You die in one hour if you get punched.

4208
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:27,570
We die in one hour?

4209
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:28,850
One hour?

4210
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:29,970
Yeah.

4211
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:31,370
And the punch...

4212
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,810
The punches stack.

4213
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:35,810
So the more punches you get, the faster you die.

4214
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,790
Like...

4215
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:39,790
If you get...

4216
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:43,150
Yeah, if you get punched by all three of us, you die in one second.

4217
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:45,050
Oh, yes.

4218
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:45,430
Yes.

4219
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:46,750
That was...

4220
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:48,430
That was really fast.

4221
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:48,930
Yeah.

4222
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:52,030
It's really fast.

4223
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:56,430
Yeah, it's like poison damage.

4224
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:56,870
It stacks.

4225
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,450
Like, times ten multiplier.

4226
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:59,370
You know?

4227
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:01,930
The multiplier.

4228
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:07,710
Here we go again.

4229
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:08,510
Yeah, yeah.

4230
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:10,390
This was our winning area.

4231
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:11,550
We won over there.

4232
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:13,170
Oh, one team.

4233
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:16,950
The cootie squad is here.

4234
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:18,990
The cootie squad.

4235
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:20,910
Oh, they're with us.

4236
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:22,230
They're with us?

4237
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:23,390
Only two.

4238
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:24,330
Only two.

4239
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:25,610
Where is the third?

4240
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,990
Oh, I hear the Valk.

4241
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:30,210
I'm gonna go kill them.

4242
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4243
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:31,910
I hear them.

4244
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:34,330
They're flying.

4245
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:35,070
They're flying?

4246
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:38,010
Where did they go?

4247
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:40,150
They took the tower.

4248
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,370
They took the Zed.

4249
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:42,710
Oh, yeah.

4250
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:43,910
They're gone.

4251
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:45,810
They went.

4252
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:47,370
They're here.

4253
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:47,630
They're here.

4254
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:50,330
Oh my god.

4255
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:52,250
Okay, you guys got this.

4256
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:53,450
I'm getting the...

4257
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:55,990
I'm getting the crate.

4258
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:57,330
Nice.

4259
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:59,110
Got it.

4260
01:46:59,230 --> 01:47:00,070
Where did they go?

4261
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,930
Here.

4262
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:03,470
Over there, I think.

4263
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:04,310
I'll scan them.

4264
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:09,410
Yeah, they're here.

4265
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:11,190
Okay.

4266
01:47:11,210 --> 01:47:12,250
I'm going to...

4267
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,690
I will go with this car.

4268
01:47:14,030 --> 01:47:14,590
Okay.

4269
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:15,970
I'll scan them for you.

4270
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:18,470
I'm going to grab this longbow.

4271
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:20,550
I will scroll first.

4272
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:21,370
Only one.

4273
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:21,870
Only one.

4274
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:22,290
Here.

4275
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:24,270
I'm heading over.

4276
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,770
I'm heading over.

4277
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:25,690
Where is the Zed teammate?

4278
01:47:28,030 --> 01:47:28,850
Where is the teammate?

4279
01:47:29,410 --> 01:47:29,770
Whoa.

4280
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:30,930
Where is the teammate?

4281
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:32,130
Another building.

4282
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:33,490
Oh, oh.

4283
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:33,990
He's coming.

4284
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:34,230
He's coming.

4285
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:34,650
It's the Loba.

4286
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:35,850
The Loba...

4287
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:37,970
The Loba queued over here.

4288
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:38,710
He's on the roof now.

4289
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:39,830
It's two.

4290
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:40,130
It's two.

4291
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:41,190
It's two.

4292
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:41,390
It's two.

4293
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:41,570
Okay.

4294
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:44,130
I'm going to climb up.

4295
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:45,410
Yeah, yeah.

4296
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:48,210
I'm heading over.

4297
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,730
Oh, it's... Oh, there...

4298
01:47:52,730 --> 01:47:52,970
Oh, my...

4299
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:55,530
Loba is... Loba is dead.

4300
01:47:56,630 --> 01:47:57,510
Wait, lolololo.

4301
01:47:57,690 --> 01:47:58,510
One hit.

4302
01:47:58,610 --> 01:47:58,910
One hit.

4303
01:47:59,090 --> 01:47:59,790
She's resing?

4304
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,710
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

4305
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,570
I fucked up.

4306
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:03,210
I fucked up.

4307
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:04,530
I fucked up.

4308
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:05,750
I fucked up.

4309
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:05,950
I fucked up, guys.

4310
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:06,890
I'm sorry.

4311
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:10,050
Heal, heal, heal.

4312
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,350
Oh, my god.

4313
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:13,490
It's okay.

4314
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:14,990
You guys can 1v3.

4315
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,290
Are you safe?

4316
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:17,930
Are you safe?

4317
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:18,330
Are you safe?

4318
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:18,990
Yeah, I'm safe.

4319
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:19,510
I'm safe.

4320
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:19,990
I'm safe.

4321
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:21,310
You're not safe.

4322
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:22,570
You are not safe.

4323
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:23,650
Just my shield.

4324
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:24,230
Just my shield.

4325
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:27,910
Oh, god.

4326
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:28,310
Behind you.

4327
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:28,730
No!

4328
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:30,430
You are not safe.

4329
01:48:31,010 --> 01:48:31,450
Kill me.

4330
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:32,350
Kill me.

4331
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:33,350
Wait, wait.

4332
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,670
Kill me.

4333
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:34,050
Kill me.

4334
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:34,530
Kill me.

4335
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:35,330
Kill me.

4336
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:35,790
Kill me.

4337
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:35,950
Yeah!

4338
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:36,670
Wait, wait.

4339
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:37,190
Look at this.

4340
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:40,030
No, no, no.

4341
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:40,790
Look at this.

4342
01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:41,170
Look at this.

4343
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:41,710
I'm going to grab you.

4344
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:42,390
I'm going to grab you.

4345
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:47,010
Isn't that too far?

4346
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:47,730
Oh, my god.

4347
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:48,390
Thank you.

4348
01:48:48,730 --> 01:48:49,690
Are you close enough?

4349
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:50,570
No!

4350
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:52,130
Yeah, I'm just waiting for them to know.

4351
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:52,830
It's okay.

4352
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:53,270
It's okay.

4353
01:48:53,270 --> 01:48:53,610
It's okay.

4354
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:54,010
It's okay.

4355
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:55,270
They didn't see.

4356
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,870
They don't see.

4357
01:48:55,930 --> 01:48:56,310
Oh, no.

4358
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:56,810
Now they know.

4359
01:48:56,890 --> 01:48:57,290
Now they know.

4360
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,730
We have to go.

4361
01:48:59,030 --> 01:48:59,530
Go, go, go.

4362
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:00,250
Now, now.

4363
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:01,250
Now, now, now.

4364
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:01,790
Now.

4365
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:02,470
Now, now, now.

4366
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:03,270
It's okay.

4367
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:03,650
Wait, wait.

4368
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:04,450
Don't worry.

4369
01:49:04,530 --> 01:49:04,850
Don't worry.

4370
01:49:04,990 --> 01:49:05,210
It's okay.

4371
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:06,550
Just res me and then we craft it later.

4372
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:07,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4373
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:08,690
I'm looking for it.

4374
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:09,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4375
01:49:11,870 --> 01:49:13,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4376
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:14,710
We craft me craft...

4377
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:16,590
Okay.

4378
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,930
No, I lost my gold gun.

4379
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:20,150
Here?

4380
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,210
Yeah, yeah.

4381
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:22,830
The dome.

4382
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:26,030
Yeah, just res me here and then craft me later.

4383
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:26,990
What happened?

4384
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:28,510
What happened to you?

4385
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:32,790
I climbed the wrong thing and then I slid.

4386
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:33,670
It was like a slide.

4387
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:34,470
Oh, okay.

4388
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:35,290
Okay.

4389
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:38,710
I thought you were with me.

4390
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:41,030
I thought so, too.

4391
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:43,190
I was there, but you know...

4392
01:49:43,190 --> 01:49:44,270
I was like one hit.

4393
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:45,630
I thought so, too.

4394
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:46,190
No!

4395
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:48,270
I lost my gold gun!

4396
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:50,190
I'm so sad!

4397
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:51,390
I'll go rest.

4398
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:54,170
I lost my gold longbow.

4399
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:55,690
It's okay.

4400
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:57,530
It's okay.

4401
01:49:57,630 --> 01:49:59,330
There's no one grab your longbow.

4402
01:49:59,490 --> 01:50:00,370
We can go back.

4403
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:02,710
Why would no one grab it?

4404
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:03,330
It's such a good gun.

4405
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:03,910
Wait, there's someone here.

4406
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,890
Why is no one use longbow?

4407
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:07,370
What do you mean?

4408
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:08,330
It's a good gun.

4409
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:10,410
There's someone here.

4410
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:11,270
I'm gonna EMP them.

4411
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:11,830
Okay.

4412
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:15,030
He's like right here.

4413
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:16,250
Oh, yeah.

4414
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:17,330
There's only one guy.

4415
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:18,970
Oh, but... Oh my god!

4416
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:19,570
What the fuck!

4417
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,070
Okay.

4418
01:50:22,710 --> 01:50:25,050
Maybe we can go lunch side?

4419
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:26,230
Lunch side.

4420
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:28,290
Go back.

4421
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:29,610
Go back?

4422
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,950
Okay.

4423
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:31,330
Go to the waterfall.

4424
01:50:31,690 --> 01:50:32,570
Oh, it's not the waterfall.

4425
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:33,810
What's there?

4426
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:35,450
Geyser?

4427
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:38,010
Geyser.

4428
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:39,550
Okay.

4429
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,350
How about lunch side?

4430
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:42,770
Lunch side.

4431
01:50:42,990 --> 01:50:44,690
Let me check.

4432
01:50:47,650 --> 01:50:49,570
Are they still there?

4433
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:51,730
They're all there.

4434
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:52,590
They're using my longbow.

4435
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:54,730
They don't lie to me.

4436
01:50:56,330 --> 01:50:58,830
They're literally using my longbow.

4437
01:51:01,790 --> 01:51:02,550
They're literally using my longbow.

4438
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:02,830
Yes, they.

4439
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:06,210
They used your longbow.

4440
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:07,450
They're using my longbow.

4441
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:08,350
Liar!

4442
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:10,910
Oh my god.

4443
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:11,510
I can't.

4444
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:13,130
I can't read their minds.

4445
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:14,550
I can't.

4446
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:16,110
Why?

4447
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:17,570
We were the closest crafters.

4448
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:18,830
There's no crafters here.

4449
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:19,190
What?

4450
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:19,870
Yeah.

4451
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:21,190
Wait.

4452
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:24,950
There's someone here.

4453
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:25,650
What the hell?

4454
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:27,410
We run backwards.

4455
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:28,710
They don't see you.

4456
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:29,970
They don't see you.

4457
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:33,650
I think we can...

4458
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:35,990
I think we can...

4459
01:51:35,990 --> 01:51:36,030
Wait.

4460
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:36,850
Wait.

4461
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:40,270
This is a scary game.

4462
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,390
This is a horror game now.

4463
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:44,670
They're right above us.

4464
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:45,050
Oh my god.

4465
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:46,050
You guys.

4466
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:48,530
They scared us.

4467
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:49,150
They scared us.

4468
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:50,310
We have to go up.

4469
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:50,830
We have to go up.

4470
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:51,350
Really?

4471
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:55,830
Pretend you're not there.

4472
01:51:55,970 --> 01:51:56,770
Pretend they only saw me.

4473
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:57,310
They only saw me.

4474
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:57,870
They don't know you're there.

4475
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:58,470
They don't know you're there.

4476
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:59,290
They don't know you're there.

4477
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:03,930
It's okay.

4478
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:06,690
They don't know.

4479
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:07,650
They don't know.

4480
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:08,450
They don't know.

4481
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:13,830
What the fuck is this area?

4482
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:15,470
They don't know but they have a bloodhound.

4483
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:16,110
Yeah.

4484
01:52:17,010 --> 01:52:17,730
It's okay.

4485
01:52:20,670 --> 01:52:22,830
They don't know but they have a bloodhound.

4486
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,530
They're not gonna scan.

4487
01:52:25,730 --> 01:52:27,490
They're not gonna scan your way.

4488
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:28,170
We have to fly.

4489
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:29,930
Maybe we can run.

4490
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,850
Maybe we can run here now.

4491
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:31,490
Can you?

4492
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:31,970
Yeah.

4493
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,530
Run left.

4494
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:33,190
Run left.

4495
01:52:33,650 --> 01:52:33,890
Wait.

4496
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:35,610
They're like right next to me though.

4497
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:36,370
Wait.

4498
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:36,610
They are?

4499
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:38,610
But they're fighting.

4500
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:40,390
Another team.

4501
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:40,970
Another team.

4502
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:41,090
Another team.

4503
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:41,310
Another team.

4504
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,390
Yeah.

4505
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:43,350
Another team.

4506
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,350
Another team.

4507
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,350
Another team.

4508
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,350
Yeah.

4509
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,850
Oh shit.

4510
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:49,110
Just hit the fragment.

4511
01:52:49,410 --> 01:52:51,730
The closest craft.

4512
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:52,410
No harvester.

4513
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:53,990
Just craft this and harvest it.

4514
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:56,910
That's literally the closest craft.

4515
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:57,250
That's literally the closest craft.

4516
01:52:57,730 --> 01:52:58,210
You.

4517
01:52:58,790 --> 01:52:59,270
You.

4518
01:52:59,450 --> 01:52:59,930
Okay.

4519
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:00,370
Jump.

4520
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,970
Jump tower.

4521
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:01,590
Jump tower.

4522
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:02,310
Jump tower.

4523
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:03,050
Yeah.

4524
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:05,710
Oh wait.

4525
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:06,290
Here.

4526
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:06,970
You can do it.

4527
01:53:06,990 --> 01:53:07,710
Be a hero.

4528
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:09,610
You know how I go there?

4529
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:10,930
Yeah.

4530
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:11,190
That's good.

4531
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:11,530
That's good.

4532
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,790
Okay.

4533
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:13,130
Nice.

4534
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:14,490
We just never leave this place.

4535
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:16,090
We're here forever.

4536
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:19,670
Yeah.

4537
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:22,030
And then you craft this and then you quick res us.

4538
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,150
Okay.

4539
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:23,450
Yeah.

4540
01:53:23,570 --> 01:53:23,970
Yeah.

4541
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:25,270
You get to the same area.

4542
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:26,470
You know what?

4543
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,090
I can... I can... Yeah.

4544
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:28,250
Yeah.

4545
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:28,350
Yeah.

4546
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:28,850
Over there.

4547
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:29,070
Over there.

4548
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:30,450
I'm gonna send the truck.

4549
01:53:30,450 --> 01:53:30,750
Okay.

4550
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:32,090
I swear.

4551
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:33,530
Somebody could... Okay.

4552
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:34,650
Bro.

4553
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:36,110
That's so dangerous.

4554
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:38,470
Don't worry about it.

4555
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:42,490
You like suddenly just start like...

4556
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:42,830
Okay.

4557
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:44,250
Zero team.

4558
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:45,150
Zero team.

4559
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:45,650
Zero team.

4560
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:45,850
Zero team.

4561
01:53:45,850 --> 01:53:46,030
Zero team.

4562
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:46,530
That's good.

4563
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,010
That's good.

4564
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:47,830
That's good.

4565
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:48,210
Nice.

4566
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:48,570
Nice.

4567
01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:48,790
Nice.

4568
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:49,210
Hero.

4569
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,110
It's a hero.

4570
01:53:51,970 --> 01:53:52,990
It's so scary.

4571
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:54,390
I saw one team.

4572
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,870
By the way.

4573
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:55,870
Oh no.

4574
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:57,610
Hero.

4575
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:58,350
It's a hero.

4576
01:53:58,350 --> 01:53:59,090
I'm pretty sure it says one.

4577
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,950
It says one.

4578
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:01,250
Okay.

4579
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:02,090
We're back guys.

4580
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:02,750
We're back.

4581
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:04,310
Okay.

4582
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:04,970
Here.

4583
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,370
I took a harvester for you too.

4584
01:54:06,670 --> 01:54:07,410
Oh nice.

4585
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:08,490
Okay.

4586
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:08,750
Okay.

4587
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:09,230
Oh my god.

4588
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:09,890
Oh okay.

4589
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:10,450
I'm back.

4590
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,010
We're back guys.

4591
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:13,130
It's like we never died.

4592
01:54:14,490 --> 01:54:14,930
Yeah.

4593
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:15,370
You know what?

4594
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:15,950
I'm taking a...

4595
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:17,390
I'm taking a respawn beacon with me.

4596
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:17,750
Oh yeah.

4597
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:18,570
That's smart.

4598
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:19,210
That's so...

4599
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:20,950
That's really smart.

4600
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:22,230
We definitely need that.

4601
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:26,310
We're a mess right now.

4602
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:26,970
I'll like sell.

4603
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:29,030
I'll like sell too.

4604
01:54:29,130 --> 01:54:29,710
Oh yeah.

4605
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:30,390
Might as well craft.

4606
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:32,330
Let's see.

4607
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:34,990
I'll do it just to get us a package.

4608
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:35,890
We need a package.

4609
01:54:36,110 --> 01:54:36,750
So bedroom.

4610
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:37,270
Yeah.

4611
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:38,350
We need a package.

4612
01:54:39,070 --> 01:54:39,510
Alright.

4613
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:40,430
Oh wait.

4614
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:41,410
Wait.

4615
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:41,910
Wait.

4616
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,050
Wait.

4617
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:44,090
Oh I hear them.

4618
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:44,450
I hear them.

4619
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:46,570
I'm gonna EMP them.

4620
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:47,230
I'll EMP them.

4621
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:49,010
Oh I hear them.

4622
01:54:49,130 --> 01:54:49,930
I'm gonna...

4623
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:51,270
Oh never mind.

4624
01:54:51,390 --> 01:54:51,690
Never mind.

4625
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,270
I'm gonna help.

4626
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,710
I'm gonna help.

4627
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:53,930
Is that yours?

4628
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:55,130
Oh that's not you.

4629
01:54:55,450 --> 01:54:56,450
That's not you.

4630
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:57,650
Wait.

4631
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:58,330
That's not me.

4632
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:59,270
That's not you.

4633
01:54:59,490 --> 01:55:00,570
They're right here.

4634
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:02,010
I thought that was you.

4635
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:04,330
I didn't shoot him because I was like Hey.

4636
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:05,130
Wait.

4637
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:05,990
Don't worry.

4638
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:07,890
That's not me.

4639
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:09,750
I have my...

4640
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:10,710
Respawn beacon.

4641
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:12,710
Leave Ditto.

4642
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:14,930
And then...

4643
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:18,970
I'm trying to leave.

4644
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:20,010
I'm trying to leave.

4645
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:22,630
I'm really in a bad position right now.

4646
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:24,580
She's having a good position.

4647
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:25,550
She's having a good position.

4648
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:26,910
I thought that was...

4649
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:30,370
The Crypto made me think the enemy Wraith was...

4650
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:32,330
Was you.

4651
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:33,770
For some reason.

4652
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:35,930
Oh my god.

4653
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:37,430
How are you alive?

4654
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:38,350
Okay.

4655
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:38,790
Res me.

4656
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:40,170
I'm scared they scan me there.

4657
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:41,050
Oh no.

4658
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:41,410
It's okay.

4659
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:41,770
It's okay.

4660
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:42,830
They don't know.

4661
01:55:44,810 --> 01:55:45,970
Ditto are you close to Res?

4662
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:47,770
Yeah.

4663
01:55:48,350 --> 01:55:49,230
Ditto you Res me.

4664
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:50,970
Ditto don't...

4665
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,430
Ditto you just say it loud.

4666
01:55:52,510 --> 01:55:53,050
They might see me.

4667
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:54,890
They're on top here.

4668
01:55:55,210 --> 01:55:56,010
It's okay.

4669
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:57,490
They don't hear.

4670
01:55:58,550 --> 01:55:59,150
Really?

4671
01:55:59,370 --> 01:55:59,810
Yeah.

4672
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:00,390
I'm sure.

4673
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:02,590
You still don't.

4674
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:03,690
No.

4675
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:07,070
I don't trust Ditto.

4676
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:08,670
They saw me.

4677
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:09,510
They saw me.

4678
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:11,930
They don't die so...

4679
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:13,250
They don't die so...

4680
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:13,810
Okay.

4681
01:56:14,410 --> 01:56:14,710
You...

4682
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:17,870
They saw you.

4683
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:19,170
No.

4684
01:56:19,310 --> 01:56:20,230
You die first.

4685
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:21,410
Okay.

4686
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:21,850
Okay.

4687
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:31,550
Break.

4688
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:33,750
You can't do that.

4689
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:37,810
Ditto you're alive though.

4690
01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:38,930
You're alive.

4691
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:40,090
Do you have beacon?

4692
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:41,130
Yeah.

4693
01:56:41,230 --> 01:56:41,890
I do.

4694
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:42,930
I do have a beacon.

4695
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:44,650
But there's somebody here.

4696
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:45,370
No.

4697
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:45,490
No.

4698
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:45,630
No.

4699
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:46,530
You like...

4700
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,190
Wait.

4701
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:48,030
There's a Loba Market.

4702
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:49,510
No.

4703
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:49,650
No.

4704
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:49,730
No.

4705
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:50,310
You know what to do?

4706
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:50,610
You...

4707
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,630
I was gonna say you should just get your drone out and rest us back there.

4708
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:54,590
Really?

4709
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:55,390
Yeah.

4710
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:55,630
Yeah.

4711
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:55,750
No.

4712
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:56,130
Do it.

4713
01:56:56,230 --> 01:56:56,650
Do it.

4714
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:59,070
I mean so... Do it.

4715
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:00,830
Wait.

4716
01:57:01,070 --> 01:57:01,670
There's no team.

4717
01:57:01,810 --> 01:57:02,270
There's no team.

4718
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:02,490
Okay.

4719
01:57:02,690 --> 01:57:03,090
Okay.

4720
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:03,650
Nevermind.

4721
01:57:03,670 --> 01:57:04,130
Let's rest us here.

4722
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:04,370
Yeah.

4723
01:57:04,430 --> 01:57:04,630
Yeah.

4724
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:04,750
Yeah.

4725
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:05,530
Let's rest.

4726
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:05,850
Let's rest.

4727
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:06,530
Honestly.

4728
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:12,810
This is why I'm not ideal.

4729
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:14,630
Loba.

4730
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:16,630
Loba.

4731
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,670
Yeah.

4732
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:18,170
We have a Loba.

4733
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:18,450
Yeah.

4734
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:18,810
We have a Loba.

4735
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:19,670
Let's go.

4736
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:20,090
Oh.

4737
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:20,950
That's good.

4738
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:22,470
We're so back.

4739
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:23,790
We're so back guys.

4740
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,590
It's okay.

4741
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:27,290
We're so back.

4742
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:29,150
Guys.

4743
01:57:29,330 --> 01:57:30,130
Everything's fine.

4744
01:57:31,010 --> 01:57:32,190
Everything is fine.

4745
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:33,050
I'm back.

4746
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:33,530
I'm back.

4747
01:57:33,670 --> 01:57:33,890
Yeah.

4748
01:57:33,930 --> 01:57:34,930
I told you guys.

4749
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:35,570
We're so back.

4750
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:35,670
Wait.

4751
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:36,670
There's no solo.

4752
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:37,750
There's a solo near us.

4753
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:38,390
Which one?

4754
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:38,790
Which one?

4755
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:39,390
Here.

4756
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:41,530
Go kill them.

4757
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:42,150
Go kill them.

4758
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:44,950
I thought you guys...

4759
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:47,730
He's here.

4760
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:48,050
He's here.

4761
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:48,410
He's here.

4762
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:48,510
He's here.

4763
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:48,750
Right here.

4764
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:49,030
Right here.

4765
01:57:49,090 --> 01:57:49,470
I'm going.

4766
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:49,710
Right here.

4767
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:50,030
Right here.

4768
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:50,430
Hello.

4769
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:54,170
Okay.

4770
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:54,370
Wait.

4771
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:54,570
Wait.

4772
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:54,830
No.

4773
01:57:55,130 --> 01:57:55,610
He's... Wait.

4774
01:57:55,670 --> 01:57:55,790
The ring.

4775
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:56,750
The ring.

4776
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:57,950
But then we can... There's Loba.

4777
01:57:58,090 --> 01:57:58,450
There's Loba.

4778
01:57:58,530 --> 01:58:00,970
Have him run so we can have his loot when he dies.

4779
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:03,330
He's gonna take the geyser.

4780
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:03,930
No.

4781
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,390
We can't take the loot though.

4782
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:06,990
He went to the door.

4783
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:08,310
Another team here.

4784
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,150
Another team.

4785
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:10,030
They're trying to keep us.

4786
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:10,750
They're keeping us.

4787
01:58:13,130 --> 01:58:13,770
Oh no.

4788
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:16,090
I think we can kill this guy.

4789
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:18,050
Okay.

4790
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:18,490
He's low.

4791
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:19,590
Oh my god.

4792
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:20,390
He's so low.

4793
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:21,090
EMP.

4794
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:21,610
EMP.

4795
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:22,050
Ditto.

4796
01:58:22,230 --> 01:58:22,510
Kill.

4797
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:23,590
Okay.

4798
01:58:23,650 --> 01:58:23,790
Okay.

4799
01:58:23,870 --> 01:58:24,650
You guys do that.

4800
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:26,230
Let's go.

4801
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:26,570
Let's go.

4802
01:58:26,630 --> 01:58:26,990
I'm going up.

4803
01:58:27,490 --> 01:58:27,890
I'm going up.

4804
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:28,550
I have to kill this team.

4805
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:29,070
Where?

4806
01:58:29,290 --> 01:58:29,570
Where?

4807
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:30,130
Over here.

4808
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:30,430
Over here.

4809
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:30,750
Over here.

4810
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,450
In front of me.

4811
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:33,770
In front of me.

4812
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:34,010
Nice.

4813
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:36,270
Behind me.

4814
01:58:36,290 --> 01:58:36,650
Behind me.

4815
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:36,910
Nice.

4816
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:37,370
Nice.

4817
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:37,930
Nice.

4818
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:39,370
On me.

4819
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:39,550
On me.

4820
01:58:39,550 --> 01:58:39,690
On me.

4821
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:40,070
Last guy.

4822
01:58:40,130 --> 01:58:40,410
Last guy.

4823
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:40,790
Okay.

4824
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:40,790
Okay.

4825
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:42,710
Oh.

4826
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:43,630
I can't see.

4827
01:58:43,770 --> 01:58:45,670
I can't see what the f...

4828
01:58:45,670 --> 01:58:46,250
I'm broken.

4829
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:47,310
No.

4830
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:49,410
I'm so bad with flat light iron sight.

4831
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:51,870
Nice.

4832
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:53,470
Nice.

4833
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,490
This is bad.

4834
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:55,870
Okay.

4835
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:57,570
This is very bad for me.

4836
01:58:58,550 --> 01:59:00,390
This is very bad for me.

4837
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:01,250
I'm logging.

4838
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:01,590
I'm logging.

4839
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:01,850
I'm very bad.

4840
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:03,250
I got hit by the...

4841
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:04,270
Oh.

4842
01:59:05,570 --> 01:59:06,670
You had gold.

4843
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:07,730
Yup.

4844
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:09,450
Okay.

4845
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:10,570
That's good.

4846
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:12,430
I recovered.

4847
01:59:12,770 --> 01:59:13,070
I recovered.

4848
01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:14,150
He is here.

4849
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:14,590
He is here.

4850
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:14,810
Okay.

4851
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:14,930
Okay.

4852
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:15,790
I need to get rid of...

4853
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:16,230
I will kill him.

4854
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:16,710
I will kill him.

4855
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:18,010
What are you looking at?

4856
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:19,410
I need loot.

4857
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:20,050
What are you looking at?

4858
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:22,210
What are you looking at?

4859
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:22,410
I don't have health.

4860
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:23,770
What you looking at?

4861
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,070

What are you looking at?

4863
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:26,630
Alright.

4864
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:28,290
I cracked him.

4865
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:28,830
Cracked him.

4866
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:29,910
You have health.

4867
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:31,590
Do you wanna fight?

4868
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:32,370
No.

4869
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:32,670
No.

4870
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:32,870
No.

4871
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:33,050
No.

4872
01:59:33,050 --> 01:59:33,130
No.

4873
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:33,190
No.

4874
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:34,770
There's team to your left looking.

4875
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:36,210
There's team to your left looking at us.

4876
01:59:36,290 --> 01:59:36,730
Thank you.

4877
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:37,010
Thank you.

4878
01:59:37,790 --> 01:59:39,910
I have to find attached man.

4879
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:45,650
We have a good spot.

4880
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:48,110
Team here, team here.

4881
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:48,550
I'm looking.

4882
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:50,310
Oh wait, what the f***?

4883
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:51,850
Two teams fighting now.

4884
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:52,850
I'm just gonna... okay.

4885
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,130
I'll push here.

4886
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:57,210
Yeah, we can go there.

4887
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:01,850
I'm looking.

4888
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:05,030
Can you EMP them?

4889
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:06,750
No, I just EMP.

4890
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:07,650
Yeah, she already used it.

4891
02:00:07,710 --> 02:00:08,410
I will need it.

4892
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:10,270
What the f***?

4893
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:13,830
I knocked one.

4894
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:16,210
On me, on my door.

4895
02:00:16,330 --> 02:00:17,570
I finished them.

4896
02:00:19,230 --> 02:00:20,310
Flash, flash, flash.

4897
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:21,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4898
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:23,350
Okay, we take this building.

4899
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:24,930
This is our building, b***h.

4900
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:25,630
Yeah.

4901
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:30,230
Be careful.

4902
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,230
That's scary.

4903
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:32,330
Whoa.

4904
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:35,190
Wait, what?

4905
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:37,550
Where are they?

4906
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:39,270
Caustic crack here.

4907
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:41,410
Flash?

4908
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:42,730
Not flash, sorry, I lied.

4909
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:45,950
Not flash, not flash.

4910
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,410
What do you flash?

4911
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:47,750
Okay, okay.

4912
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:49,550
Another one inside the building.

4913
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:51,230
Yeah.

4914
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:52,490
Okay.

4915
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:54,130
I'm going up, I'm going up.

4916
02:00:54,730 --> 02:00:55,130
Okay.

4917
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:55,950
I'm batting.

4918
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,410
I'm going to you.

4919
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:00,030
I got them, I got them.

4920
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:00,490
They're over here.

4921
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:02,390
Over here?

4922
02:01:02,510 --> 02:01:03,410
They're getting shot at.

4923
02:01:04,050 --> 02:01:05,650
Okay, another team, be careful.

4924
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:07,450
I cracked them, I cracked them.

4925
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:09,510
Okay.

4926
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:10,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4927
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:10,550
They're cracked.

4928
02:01:10,770 --> 02:01:12,030
We can't fight, we can't fight, we can't fight.

4929
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:13,270
I almost have EMP.

4930
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:14,490
Yeah, yeah, let's wait for EMP.

4931
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:16,490
I have ult, I have ult.

4932
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,430
Okay, where do you want me EMP?

4933
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:19,790
I'm going to loot.

4934
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:21,890
Now I'm just looking guys.

4935
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:24,590
There's a gold res here for you, Hiro.

4936
02:01:24,690 --> 02:01:25,410
Maybe they're laning.

4937
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,430
I'm not sure.

4938
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:28,670
I don't know either.

4939
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,050
Here, here, here.

4940
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:32,470
We gotta get the zone though.

4941
02:01:32,690 --> 02:01:33,330
I would, okay.

4942
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:35,650
Oh yeah, I have to get the zone.

4943
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:36,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah, with the zone.

4944
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:38,510
We might get gate kept here.

4945
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:41,490
Where's the other team?

4946
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:43,350
I don't know, that's the scary part.

4947
02:01:43,650 --> 02:01:44,830
I don't know.

4948
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:46,530
They're there.

4949
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:47,510
Over there.

4950
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,150
So that means we can push up here.

4951
02:01:49,230 --> 02:01:50,830
We are not inside it.

4952
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:53,250
Yeah, we have to figure out how to...

4953
02:01:53,250 --> 02:01:54,090
We have to figure out where to go.

4954
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:55,750
We can take this place.

4955
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:57,530
Yeah, we can just stand here.

4956
02:01:58,950 --> 02:02:00,790
Maybe it's full team lag.

4957
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:02,310
Let me scan them.

4958
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:04,030
Be careful.

4959
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,630
Maybe... I'm not sure.

4960
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:05,910
I'm looking.

4961
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:07,250
Here, here, here.

4962
02:02:07,410 --> 02:02:08,530
Here, here, here.

4963
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:09,330
Oh, okay.

4964
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:12,130
Oh, they're hiding.

4965
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:13,710
Here, there's one here.

4966
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:16,090
There's one here too.

4967
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:17,170
Look.

4968
02:02:18,690 --> 02:02:19,710
I'm batting, I'm batting.

4969
02:02:19,890 --> 02:02:21,290
They have blue armor.

4970
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:22,330
They're not that strong.

4971
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:24,690
This is three people with the tech.

4972
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:25,450
Wait, it's a solo.

4973
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:27,150
No, it's Chi.

4974
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:27,770
Chi.

4975
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,130
I'm doing something stupid.

4976
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:34,070
I got one, I got one.

4977
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:35,730
Okay.

4978
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:36,210
Oh, cracked.

4979
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:37,690
Okay.

4980
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:38,950
Someone stay high ground.

4981
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:41,810
Dead, dead.

4982
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:42,090
Oh, wait.

4983
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:42,790
One more, one more.

4984
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:43,430
I'm throwing the other one.

4985
02:02:44,530 --> 02:02:45,430
Be careful, be careful.

4986
02:02:46,230 --> 02:02:48,530
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

4987
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:49,990
He's here, he's here.

4988
02:02:51,410 --> 02:02:51,850
I'm pushing.

4989
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:53,530
Okay, me too.

4990
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:54,250
I'm pushing too.

4991
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:55,910
You can push, you can push.

4992
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:58,750
Oh, all red, all red.

4993
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:00,510
I'm batting, I'm batting.

4994
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:00,910
I need cover.

4995
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:01,450
You know.

4996
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:03,450
Okay, she's out.

4997
02:03:03,570 --> 02:03:04,990
Don't land on me.

4998
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:06,230
Low, low, low, low, low.

4999
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:07,110
Nice, nice, nice.

5000
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:08,570
Oh, Ditto died.

5001
02:03:10,770 --> 02:03:12,170
Look at that.

5002
02:03:12,230 --> 02:03:12,790
We're so good.

5003
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:13,070
We're so good.

5004
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:16,850
Ditto and I died like six times.

5005
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:17,770
We're so good.

5006
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:19,870
Ditto and I died like six times.

5007
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:23,470
We died a lot.

5008
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:26,590
He was MVP.

5009
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:27,990
He was MVP.

5010
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:33,530
Thanks for the scan.

5011
02:03:33,810 --> 02:03:34,990
This thing res.

5012
02:03:35,310 --> 02:03:36,090
The res.

5013
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:38,590
You tell Ditto it was just resing us.

5014
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,340
Crypto's really fun now though.

5015
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:48,000
You can't run away from cooties.

5016
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:51,800
It's like, you know like those like...

5017
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:53,280
No, it's just like the sanitizers.

5018
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:55,340
It kills 99% of germs.

5019
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,460
And then he has the 1% that lives.

5020
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,040
You might kill...

5021
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:05,960
99% of cooties.

5022
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:09,200
But there's the 1% that will bring us back.

5023
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:10,120
But there's the 1% that will bring us back.

5024
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:15,040
So carrying a respawn becomes so great.

5025
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:15,620
So carrying a respawn becomes so great.

5026
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,620
I can't believe we won that.

5027
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,560
Holy shit.

5028
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:25,980
We should not have won that.

5029
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:31,420
The first part where Doki fell in the lava.

5030
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:31,960
The first part where Doki fell in the lava.

5031
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:32,980
The first part where Doki fell in the lava.

5032
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:39,700
I did not expect that.

5033
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:40,210
I actually think...

5034
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:42,160
That's just like a poor way to do it.

5035
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:42,760
I'm like, come on!

5036
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:48,180
I like - I climb the one area that you can't climb.

5037
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,360
Then I slid down.

5038
02:04:50,620 --> 02:04:53,280
Then I slide down.

5039
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:53,360
Yeah.

5040
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:57,060
And then like, Ditto and I were fighting on top of it and I was like, hmm...

5041
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:58,060
I'll show you, I'll show you.

5042
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:00,000
If you land here, I'll show you where I climbed.

5043
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:00,460
Okay.

5044
02:05:00,920 --> 02:05:01,780
There's like three teams.

5045
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:02,600
Maybe a lot.

5046
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:03,960
Yeah.

5047
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:05,040
No, we can do it.

5048
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:05,660
I think we should go here.

5049
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:06,600
I think we should go here first.

5050
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:07,060
Okay, yeah, yeah, you're right.

5051
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:07,900
Okay, I'm with you.

5052
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:09,300
There's a team of us, there's a team of us.

5053
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:10,280
One team, one team, yeah.

5054
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:12,400
I will grab a gun, I will grab a gun.

5055
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:12,560
I have a gun too.

5056
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:13,160
Can you grab it?

5057
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:14,440
Yeah, I got a gun.

5058
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,220
Me too.

5059
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:15,700
Okay, good.

5060
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,020
I don't have it.

5061
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:17,100
You're going this way?

5062
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:19,080
I'm heading over.

5063
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:22,460
Oh, that's a Mirage.

5064
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:23,460
I'm here, Diddle.

5065
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,860
I don't know where the other...

5066
02:05:27,140 --> 02:05:27,480
Nice.

5067
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:29,200
I'm trying to figure out where the other guy is.

5068
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,820
He's outside here.

5069
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:31,960
Yeah, I hear him.

5070
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:34,160
On my left?

5071
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,360
Oh, they have two...

5072
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,700
Oh, here, here.

5073
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:40,340
What the fuck?

5074
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:40,820
What is he doing?

5075
02:05:41,020 --> 02:05:41,640
What is he doing?

5076
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:42,780
Why did he...

5077
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:44,860
Why did two Black...

5078
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:45,560
What?

5079
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,100
I mean, okay.

5080
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:49,060
I'll take it.

5081
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,560
Oh, he's like, oh my god, he's so cute.

5082
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:52,560
He's like...

5083
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:53,260
He's so cute.

5084
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:55,380
Thank you.

5085
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,560
What's the order?

5086
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,680
Oh my god, that's the Mirage clone.

5087
02:06:00,220 --> 02:06:00,700
Yeah.

5088
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:02,700
Let me check.

5089
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,500
Let me check.

5090
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:04,500
He wanted a hug.

5091
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:05,960
Here, um...

5092
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,860
Wait.

5093
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:09,280
Where's the Mirage?

5094
02:06:09,940 --> 02:06:10,780
Here, here, here.

5095
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:11,300
Here, here, here.

5096
02:06:11,300 --> 02:06:11,460
Here.

5097
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:12,840
Just the Mirage.

5098
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:13,380
He...

5099
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,240
Yeah.

5100
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,500
I think the teammate ran.

5101
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:19,040
Yeah, I think you ran the crab.

5102
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:19,600
Yeah, yeah.

5103
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:20,260
Yeah.

5104
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:21,360
I'm pretty sure.

5105
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,720
Because the Mirage can crab, right?

5106
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:23,420
Yeah, not here.

5107
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5108
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:24,980
I don't think so.

5109
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:25,200
Let me check.

5110
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:25,900
Let me check.

5111
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:26,880
Okay, there's one here.

5112
02:06:27,640 --> 02:06:28,040
Okay.

5113
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:28,820
And there's one here.

5114
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:29,940
Okay.

5115
02:06:30,620 --> 02:06:31,020
Bloodhound.

5116
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:31,620
Alright.

5117
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:34,480
Oh, yeah, with me, with me.

5118
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:35,280
Oh, with you.

5119
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:36,080
They didn't run?

5120
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:36,300
Yeah.

5121
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:36,960
Huh?

5122
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:38,540
It's Bangalore.

5123
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:39,320
Oh.

5124
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:41,180
I think she's running now.

5125
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:41,920
I think she's running.

5126
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:42,120
Yeah.

5127
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,140
Now she's running.

5128
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:45,180
I'm gonna check the other...

5129
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:46,720
Make sure the other team doesn't push us.

5130
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:48,380
On the jump tower?

5131
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:50,200
You guys got it, I believe.

5132
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:53,060
Oh, they're fighting too.

5133
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:53,960
Oh my gosh.

5134
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:55,260
They're so low.

5135
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:58,780
Wait, there's two teams here.

5136
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,160
Let's explore this way.

5137
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:00,840
Oh, wait.

5138
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,700
Wait, I got her.

5139
02:07:01,820 --> 02:07:02,420
Oh, you got her.

5140
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,300
You guys, I see her.

5141
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:04,760
What?

5142
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:07,020
So good.

5143
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:08,660
Oh my god, I really wanna shoot so badly.

5144
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:10,060
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

5145
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:10,900
They're pushing.

5146
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:11,680
I'm gonna watch.

5147
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:11,880
Nice job.

5148
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:12,840
I'm here.

5149
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:13,620
They're right here.

5150
02:07:13,660 --> 02:07:14,040
They're right here.

5151
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:14,540
They're pushing.

5152
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:15,080
I'm here.

5153
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:15,500
I'm here.

5154
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:16,060

5155
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:16,280

5156
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:16,480

Okay, I got the loot a little bit.

02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:20,580
Okay.

They...

5163
02:07:21,940 --> 02:07:22,380
They fused also.

5164
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:22,580
Your team?

5165
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,260
Or are they...

5166
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:23,400

Okay, full fight.

Okay, okay.

02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:36,740
Yeah, he's so low.

5176
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:37,580

Okay.

5181
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:43,800
No, I have to reload.

5182
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,400
Holy shit.

5183
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,260

02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:39,740
I have to reload.

5231
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:40,040
Yes!

5232
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:42,320

Oh my god, that was so scary.

5238
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:48,260
Oh my god.

5239
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:50,000
Doki, can you rez me?

5240
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:51,080
I'm gonna send the lava.

5241
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:51,880
Yeah, yeah.

5242
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:52,680
I'm so low.

5243
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:54,240
Okay.

5244
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,320
I don't have gold rez.

5245
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:56,960
Wait, where's the rez?

5246
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:57,940
Oh, I lied.

5247
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:00,100
Oh, Doki.

5248
02:09:03,380 --> 02:09:04,580
Abe, she's a liar.

5249
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:06,480
No, it's coz she died in the lava.

5250
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:08,460
I didn't realize he died in the lava.

5251
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:09,580
Wait, you don't have gold?

5252
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,580
No, I don't.

5253
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:14,140
I thought she had gold coz, like, I had to destroy her armor.

5254
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,320
You say.

5255
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,200
I died.

5256
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:18,340
You're so funny.

5257
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:18,360
I'm in the water.

5258
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:23,180
I will play L-Star.

5259
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,700
Oh, you're gonna play L-Star?

5260
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:25,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I got two kills with RE-48... 45.

5263
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,020
Oh, you should run it.

5264
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:36,340
Okay.

5265
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,540
Yeah, you should run it.

5266
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:38,320
That means like...

5267
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:38,960
Find me this!

5268
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,080
Find me this!

5269
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:42,080
Okay, I'll find you.

5270
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,860
Don't worry, I believe.

5271
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:45,580
Okay, there's nobody here right away.

5272
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:46,420
Yeah.

5273
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:47,740
We killed everybody.

5274
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:49,260
Okay.

Okay, okay.

5278
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,100
That's it.

5279
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:55,200
Nice.

5280
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,860
Wait, there's rest over here.

5281

02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:02,300
Do you have jump tower?

5287
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:03,760
No, we can use this jump.

5288
02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:04,620
Yeah, I was like...

5289
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:05,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5290
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:05,620
It's so far.

5291
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:06,440
Wait, wait, wait.

5292
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:08,600
Okay, I'll show you guys where I climbed.

02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,060
Okay, so like...

5295
02:10:11,060 --> 02:10:11,080
Wait, where are you?

5296
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:11,500
I'm here.

5297
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,440
Okay, I'm watching.

02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:14,420
Okay, so like...

5299
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:15,700
You know how we were all here?

5300
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:17,020
Right here.

5301
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:17,360
Uh-huh.

5302
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,060
So...

5303
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:19,760
You guys all climbed this, right?

5304
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:21,160
You guys climbed this, right?

5305
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:21,480

5307
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:24,940
Oh, okay.

5308
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,200
Okay.

5309
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,160
That's how I felt.

5310
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:36,940
Dido and I were already running away when you were talking.

5311
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:38,900
Did you see?

5312
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:39,700
Did you see though?

5313
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:40,060

Okay, I'm going over here.

5319
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:45,940

Hey, I knocked one.

02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,340
Okay, I'm pushing out.

Oh, okay.

5362
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:24,320
Go, go, go.

5363
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:25,000
Die to the ring.

5364
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:25,460
Die to the ring.

5365
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:26,680

5369
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:30,200
I'm like full.

5370
02:11:30,820 --> 02:11:32,140
I'm like full right now.

5371
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:32,760
Yeah, yeah.

5372
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,580
I have your drone.

5373
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:36,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5374
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:37,880
We slowly die.

5375
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:38,820
Oh my god.

5376
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:39,500
This is zone one.

5377
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:41,160
Here, here.

5378
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:41,840
Here's some names.

02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:50,440
Oh.

5383
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:53,080
I flew.

5384
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,340
Like a rocket jump.

5385
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:59,240
It would be funny if a team pushes us.

5386
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:01,040
What are you trying to do?

5387
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:02,100
I have gold res.

5388
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:02,820

02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:05,080
Wow.

There you go.

5393
02:12:06,260 --> 02:12:07,140
And then here's the drone.

5394
02:12:07,140 --> 02:12:07,680
Well, thank you.

5395
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:08,560
There you go.

5396
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,560
And I'll feed you some shizzles too.

5397
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:10,760
Wow.

5398
02:12:13,620 --> 02:12:14,100
I'm going to go get some gold res.

5399
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:15,360
There's nobody here, by the way.

5400
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,620
See, I told you I have gold res.

5401

See, look at us.

5406
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:29,300
Girl squad, girl squad.

5407
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,600
I'm leaving.

5408
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,660
You can't leave the girl squad.

5409
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,200
Wait.

5410
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:39,840

02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:41,160

5416
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:45,600

02:12:45,740 --> 02:12:49,160
I have like 250 damage and eight assists.

5418
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:50,380
You have eight?

5419
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,620
Oh my god.

5420
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:54,320
A lot.

5421
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,480

He's so low.

5442
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:17,300
He's by himself.

5443
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:19,060
How is that low?

5444
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:20,080
He's so low.

5445
02:13:20,380 --> 02:13:21,520
I'll scan them again for you.

5446
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,000

Okay, okay, okay.

5454
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:28,680

02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:36,700
I need help.

5465
02:13:36,740 --> 02:13:37,000
Last guy.

5466
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:37,280
Last guy.

5467
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:37,520
Last guy.

5468
02:13:38,380 --> 02:13:38,980
You're right here.

5469
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:40,660
He wants to thirst me.

5470
02:13:40,720 --> 02:13:41,620
He's fucking crazy.

5471
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:41,860
No!

5472
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:42,600
Oh my god.

5473
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:43,280
He actually got it.

5474
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:43,540
It's okay.

5475
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:43,820
It's okay.

5476
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:44,480
Look at this.

5477
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:44,940
Look at this.

5478
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,640
Look at this.

5479
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:46,860
He actually got it.

5480
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:47,240
What?

5481
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:48,820
Oh my god.

5482
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:49,940
My harvester.

5483
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:51,640
He actually...

5484
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,140
He has let him...

5485
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:53,740
Another team.

5486
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:54,180
Another team.

5487
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:54,800
No!

5488
02:13:55,420 --> 02:13:55,560
Really?

5489
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:56,960
My lord.

5490
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,480
You gotta rest me back.

5491
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:00,100
I'm resting you right now.

5492
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:01,440
I'm resting you right here.

5493
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:01,780
Yeah, yeah.

5494
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:08,560
I don't have a magazine.

5495
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:11,100
I got griefed so hard.

5496
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:11,920
Wait, wait, wait.

5497
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:13,500
There's someone laying here.

5498
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,500
Yeah, buddy.

5499
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:15,060
My stuff.

5500
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:15,440
It's me.

5501
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:15,840
Yeah, it's me.

5502
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:16,340
It's me.

5503
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:19,460
I forgot.

5504
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,660
Wait, this one has a gold... gold dock.

5505
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:24,140
Yeah, I have gold.

5506
02:14:24,360 --> 02:14:25,660
I will give you gold here.

5507
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,120
Okay.

5508
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:27,720
I need...

5509
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,220
I need to grab my stuff, guys.

5510
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:30,280
Take me back home.

5511
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:30,380
Oh, yeah.

5512
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,620
You can.

5513
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:31,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5514
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,540
You can guard me.

5515
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:33,280
They're resting over there.

5516
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:34,640
Yeah, they're resting anyway.

5517
02:14:34,700 --> 02:14:35,360
So I need to get my stuff.

5518
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:35,780
There's...

5519
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:36,340
There's another team.

5520
02:14:36,340 --> 02:14:38,840
I'm out here, but it's safe here, I think.

5521
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,220
You can grab your loot.

5522
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:41,360
I need my loot back.

5523
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:41,760
I can't believe it.

5524
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:42,760
Oh, dude, they're fighting here.

5525
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:44,840
That's so fucked up.

5526
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:45,580
I can't believe it.

5527
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:45,840
Wait, what?

5528
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:46,480
I got a magazine.

5529
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:47,240
Did you scan out someone?

5530
02:14:47,620 --> 02:14:48,540
Yeah, you scanned somebody.

5531
02:14:49,220 --> 02:14:50,560
Yeah, I scanned in there.

5532
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:50,980
In there.

5533
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:51,240
Yeah.

5534
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:52,780
I saw that, too.

5535
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:53,440
Yeah, we can...

5536
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,000
We can...

5537
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:55,120
Over there.

5538
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:55,360
Over there.

5539
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:55,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5540
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:56,340
We can...

5541
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:56,920
Oh, they're inframing.

5542
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:57,240
They're inframing.

5543
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,260
In front of me.

5544
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:01,640
They're lying.

5545
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:02,480
They're lying.

5546
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:04,640
Flesh, flesh, flesh.

5547
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:04,940
What the fuck?

5548
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:07,980
You okay?

5549
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:08,960
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

5550
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:09,120
I'm right here.

5551
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:09,480
I knocked one.

5552
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:10,100
I knocked one.

5553
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:10,220
Right here.

5554
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:10,780
Right in front of me.

5555
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:11,200
Right in front of me.

5556
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:12,680
There's another one.

5557
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:13,700
The other one's behind there.

5558
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:15,280
Nice.

5559
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:16,220
Where's the last guy?

5560
02:15:17,480 --> 02:15:17,800
Thirsty?

5561
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:21,500
Yeah, fuck you, lifeline.

5562
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:23,380
There can only be one lifeline in this lobby.

5563
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:24,660
Oh my god.

5564
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,500
You supposed to stop me.

5565
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:28,580
I'm not gonna finish this guy.

5566
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:30,540
I don't care about this guy, but I'm gonna do this.

5567
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:31,760
Oh, wait.

5568
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:32,220
What the fuck?

5569
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:33,300
Me.

5570
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:33,940
Me.

5571
02:15:35,300 --> 02:15:35,620
I'm a fucking loser.

5572
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:36,380
Wait, they're fighting over here.

5573
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:36,940
You wanna join?

5574
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:37,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5575
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,340
I want to join.

5576
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,480
Okay.

5577
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:40,980
Why did you have...

5578
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:41,140
Oh.

5579
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:41,940
She...

5580
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:42,760
Over there.

5581
02:15:42,820 --> 02:15:43,960
That's just health much delivered.

5582
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:45,140
Let me scan it out for you.

5583
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:45,400
Okay.

5584
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:47,120
Here.

5585
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:47,820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5586
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:48,180
I see them.

5587
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:48,740
I'm heading over.

5588
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:48,860
Oh, they're dead.

5589
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:49,940
They finished.

5590
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:50,400
They finished.

5591
02:15:50,540 --> 02:15:50,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5592
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,080
Okay.

5593
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:52,040
They're shooting a drone now.

5594
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:55,880
Wait, I'm gonna wait for Ditto so she can tank the damage from me.

5595
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:56,840
Okay.

5596
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:57,400
Oh, no.

5597
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:58,800
I'm not gonna tank damage from you.

5598
02:15:58,800 --> 02:15:59,120
What do you mean?

5599
02:15:59,120 --> 02:15:59,900
You're the fragger!

5600
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:00,860
You're the entry fragger!

5601
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:01,660
I'm literally support!

5602
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:03,520
Why?

5603
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:06,140
Support can be attacker too!

5604
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,380
You can be an attacker too!

5605
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:09,960
Yeah, but I'm literally support!

5606
02:16:13,120 --> 02:16:14,080
Let's armor!

5607
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:14,520
Let's armor!

5608
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:14,960
Crack!

5609
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:15,280
Crack!

5610
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:15,340
Crack!

5611
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:16,560
Okay, I'm batting, I'm batting.

5612
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:18,500
Full squad there.

5613
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:19,560
I cracked the one.

5614
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:21,380
Maybe we can go here.

5615
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:22,420
Yeah, we were okay.

5616
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:23,620
Yeah.

5617
02:16:23,620 --> 02:16:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5618
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:24,980
Here.

5619
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:26,440
I'm here.

5620
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:28,440
Wait, I cracked like two of them.

5621
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:28,600
Okay.

5622
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:29,200
No, I can't.

5623
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:29,460
I just hit.

5624
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:30,620
I will kill up.

5625
02:16:30,620 --> 02:16:31,100
I will kill up.

5626
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:32,340
Yeah, we're heading over.

5627
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:32,860
We're heading over.

5628
02:16:33,060 --> 02:16:33,580
I'm behind, okay?

5629
02:16:33,740 --> 02:16:34,160
I'm going to...

5630
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:36,040
They're over there.

5631
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:36,760
I see them.

5632
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:36,980
They're fighting.

5633
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,960
I'm here a little bit.

5634
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:39,620
Here, the lifeline.

5635
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:39,960
The lifeline.

5636
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:41,940
We have to kill the lifeline right here in front of me.

5637
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:43,760
Flash, flash, flash, flash!

5638
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:44,320
Oh, lifeline?

5639
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:45,120
Yeah, yeah.

5640
02:16:45,140 --> 02:16:45,760
Right here, right here.

5641
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:46,220
On me too.

5642
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,280
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

5643
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:48,680
There's another team.

5644
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:49,280
There's another team.

5645
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:49,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5646
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:50,140
I'm here.

5647
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:50,440
I'm here.

5648
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:50,880
Three teams.

5649
02:16:51,180 --> 02:16:51,720
They're fighting.

5650
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:52,160
They're fighting.

5651
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,200
This guy is a solo.

5652
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:53,820
He's dead.

5653
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:54,920
In that truck.

5654
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:58,000
There's a solo in that truck.

5655
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:58,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5656
02:16:58,500 --> 02:16:59,580
Kill, kill, kill this one.

5657
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:00,100
Kill this one.

5658
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:01,280
Okay, okay.

5659
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:02,260
Let me go scan them.

5660
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:03,780
Wait, wait.

5661
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:04,440
Wait, wait.

5662
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,520
I want to...

5663
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:06,540
Okay, okay, okay.

5664
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:07,380
Yeah, I'm coming back.

5665
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,100
They're down here.

5666
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:08,640
They're down there.

5667
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:09,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5668
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:09,480
Down there.

5669
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:09,840
Okay, okay, okay.

5670
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:11,200
Here, there's nobody.

5671
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:12,680
I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

5672
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:13,300
Okay, I'm right behind you.

5673
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:14,020
I'm right behind you.

5674
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:15,120
They're down there.

5675
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:15,380
They're there.

5676
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:16,560
Okay.

5677
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:17,400
Oh, there's...

5678
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:18,060
There's someone here.

5679
02:17:18,140 --> 02:17:18,720
They're pretty far.

5680
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:19,760
There's death blocks.

5681
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:20,620
Death blocks here.

5682
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:21,580
Yeah, let's just loot.

5683
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:22,000
Let's just loot.

5684
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:22,480
Reset.

5685
02:17:22,580 --> 02:17:23,160
Okay, okay.

5686
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:24,720
There's like a rat right here.

5687
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:25,640
I saw him.

5688
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:25,820
Okay.

5689
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:29,820
There's a lot of team here.

5690
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,240
There's another...

5691
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:33,520
I think they're gold now.

5692
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:34,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5693
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:35,720
Where are they?

5694
02:17:36,060 --> 02:17:36,780
Where did they go?

5695
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:37,960
Okay.

5696
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,500
I think they went down.

5697
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:42,060
Yeah, I think so too.

5698
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:45,240
Oh, but we're going to get camped on our own.

5699
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:46,500
Wait, wait, wait.

5700
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:47,460
On me, on me, on me, on me.

5701
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,060
On you?

5702
02:17:48,340 --> 02:17:48,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5703
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:50,080
On me, on me, on me, on me.

5704
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:50,600
Oh, but we're going to get camped on our own.

5705
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5706
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:52,060
Right here, right here, right here.

5707
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,240
Under, under, under, under, under.

5708
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:54,760
Come here.

5709
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:56,200
Oh, yeah.

5710
02:17:56,260 --> 02:17:57,040
He's, he's gripping...

5711
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:57,940
Zipping, zipping.

5712
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:58,540
Grapple, grapple.

5713
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:00,480
On you guys.

5714
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:01,540
Okay.

5715
02:18:01,640 --> 02:18:02,380
I'm going to...

5716
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:05,520
I'm going to use my ult inside this.

5717
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:06,000
Okay.

5718
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:06,080
Okay.

5719
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:07,140
Wait, I have EMP.

5720
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:07,680
I have EMP.

5721
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:09,080
Okay, okay.

5722
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:12,120
Oh, this poor fucking team.

5723
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:14,360
Okay.

5724
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:15,380
Nice.

5725
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:15,760
Okay.

5726
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,620
I knocked one.

5727
02:18:16,980 --> 02:18:17,680
Where's his teammates?

5728
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:19,320
I don't know.

5729
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:19,580
Wait.

5730
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:20,460
What?

5731
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:20,580
I don't know.

5732
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:21,260
I think he's high.

5733
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:21,960
Maybe I'm in.

5734
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:22,220
Yeah.

5735
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:23,720
Flash, flash, flash, flash, right here.

5736
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:24,520
Flash.

5737
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:27,880
Oh, my God.

5738
02:18:27,980 --> 02:18:28,320
Pathfinder.

5739
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:30,200
Oh, my God.

5740
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:30,860
He's so low.

5741
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:32,520
Nice.

5742
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:34,120
Oh, no.

5743
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,020
Not nice.

5744
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:35,300
No.

5745
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:39,800
He's literally one.

5746
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:42,720
Here, I'll put a jump tower here.

5747
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:44,780
Not nice.

5748
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:48,920
I got him.

5749
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,240
I got him.

5750
02:18:49,240 --> 02:18:49,500
I got him.

5751
02:18:49,520 --> 02:18:49,760
I got him.

5752
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,260
Nice.

5753
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:50,580
Nice.

5754
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:50,640
Nice.

5755
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:52,220
Wait.

5756
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:52,920
He's here.

5757
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:53,480
He's here.

5758
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:54,760
Okay.

5759
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:54,940
Okay.

5760
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,620
I will go back.

5761
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:56,240
I will go back.

5762
02:18:56,260 --> 02:18:56,780
I will go back.

5763
02:18:56,940 --> 02:18:57,040
I will go.

5764
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:57,440
I'm going there.

5765
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,440
You should come with me.

5766
02:18:59,000 --> 02:18:59,360
Okay.

5767
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:00,920
I'm heading over.

5768
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:02,620
Okay.

5769
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:03,340
Follow me.

5770
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:03,820
Follow me.

5771
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:05,980
I'm coming back now.

5772
02:19:06,140 --> 02:19:06,440
Oh, my God.

5773
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,400
I'm so far.

5774
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:08,100
I'm so far, guys.

5775
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:08,660
I'm so far.

5776
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:09,600
Your support is so far.

5777
02:19:11,460 --> 02:19:13,260
One hundred on my ping.

5778
02:19:14,340 --> 02:19:14,700
Coming.

5779
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:15,920
Oh, wait a minute.

5780
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:17,060
I'm going to take this.

5781
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,140
Guys, I'm looting.

5782
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:19,540
I'm looting.

5783
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:19,600
I'm looting.

5784
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:22,220
They took the high ground.

5785
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:24,320
We can go here.

5786
02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:28,360
I think we can fight them if...

5787
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,780
Wait, there's someone on our right.

5788
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:30,980
They're not here.

5789
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:35,160
Where are they here?

5790
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:37,120
They came here.

5791
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:37,760
On my ping.

5792
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:39,680
Loba is cracked.

5793
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,420
Let me get him for you.

5794
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:46,520
Wait, what the f...

5795
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,300
I hate ping.

5796
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:48,360
I got one.

5797
02:19:49,180 --> 02:19:49,660
Flash.

5798
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:56,800
He's one.

5799
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,280
No, there's a last guy.

5800
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,700
I'm safe.

5801
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:11,020
I need energy armor.

5802
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:11,800
I got him.

5803
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:12,540
Don't worry.

5804
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:13,440
There's energy here.

5805
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,260
Alright.

5806
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:20,120
Where's the...

5807
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:21,740
Where's the last two teams?

5808
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:23,820
There's one over here.

5809
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:25,340
Okay, okay, okay.

5810
02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:26,620
Let me get him for you.

5811
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,500
There's two...

5812
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:29,260
There's two over there.

5813
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:32,880
I'm just gonna...

5814
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:34,420
He's low.

5815
02:20:34,640 --> 02:20:35,200
Over there.

5816
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:37,640
I can't see him.

5817
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:39,940
32 purple.

5818
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:41,260
He's pushing you.

5819
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:45,080
I feel like there's someone near me.

5820
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:46,500
There's someone near me.

5821
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:46,600
Is there?

5822
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:48,300
Like, at the bottom?

5823
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:50,680
Oh, I'm here, Mimir.

5824
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:52,060
Yeah, one team.

5825
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:52,420
One team.

5826
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:52,920
Not solo.

5827
02:20:53,220 --> 02:20:53,680
Not solo?

5828
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:54,120
Okay.

5829
02:20:54,200 --> 02:20:55,360
I can't see this guy.

5830
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:56,700
I'm backing out.

5831
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:57,260
I'm backing out.

5832
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:58,420
I'm backing out to Hiro.

5833
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:01,180
They're there.

5834
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:02,180
Okay.

5835
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:05,340
Yeah, we're getting gatecapped.

5836
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:08,620
Yeah, we have to cut the left.

5837
02:21:08,620 --> 02:21:08,880
I have EMP.

5838
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:09,440
I have EMP.

5839
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:10,780
I'm gonna EMP them.

5840
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:14,020
Whichever team we fight, the other team's gonna third party us.

5841
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:16,260
I think I hear a note here.

5842
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,120
EMP!

5843
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:18,600
EMP!

5844
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:20,260
I got one!

5845
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:20,580
I got one!

5846
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:20,880
I got one!

5847
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:21,500
I'm going!

5848
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:21,920
I'm going!

5849
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,280
I'm going!

5850
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:23,680
One!

5851
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:26,920
One in!

5852
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:29,000
Where is he?

5853
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:30,260
Where is he?

5854
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:31,200
Alright.

5855
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:32,960
Where is the guy?

5856
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:35,100
Wait, they're fighting?

5857
02:21:35,220 --> 02:21:35,560
They're fighting?

5858
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:36,860
Yeah, but they're fighting a rat.

5859
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:39,220
There's only one guy.

5860
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:39,820
Wait, wait, let them fight!

5861
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:40,180
Let them fight!

5862
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:40,340
No!

5863
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:41,320
We should've let them fight!

5864
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:42,360
It would've been funny!

5865
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,820
Yeah, it's a rat versus rat!

5866
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:46,320
Oh!

5867
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:49,200
That's really the last guy.

5868
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:50,660
Last guy.

5869
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:52,020
Rat versus rat.

5870
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,980
They're actually both one hit, I think.

5871
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:57,740
That's a poor rat!

5872
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,500
I think they're about to die.

5873
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:02,780
I think I almost got 4k.

5874
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:04,660
Oh my god.

5875
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:05,780
Another one!

5876
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:06,520
I was just scanning.

5877
02:22:09,220 --> 02:22:11,840
He's like, yeah, Havoc is really good.

5878
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,360
Look, I have AT.

5879
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:14,660
I think all...

5880
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,400
You're an assist!

5881
02:22:18,380 --> 02:22:19,400
You're an assist!

5882
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:21,700
You're an assist!

5883
02:22:21,820 --> 02:22:23,220
You're the assist queen.

5884
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:25,240
Oh my god.

5885
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:27,400
Crypto is strong.

5886
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:30,760
I think Crypto is strong in a team fight.

5887
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:31,800
I think Crypto is strong in a team fight.

5888
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,600
Because then you EMP and then like...

5889
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:37,460
Yeah, because they're trying to gate keep us.

5890
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:37,720
Yeah.

5891
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:40,840
And then they EMP and they can't do anything.

5892
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:44,560
Oh my god.

5893
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:45,940
We're so good, guys.

5894
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:47,900
Girl squad, girl squad.

5895
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:54,780
This is it.

5896
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,200
How many wins did we get?

5897
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:58,420
We got so many wins.

5898
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:01,720
Yeah, I feel like we won like almost every time.

5899
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,280
Yeah, I mean...

5900
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,520
Oh, why don't we win?

5901
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:06,900
I'm silver.

5902
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:09,920
Yeah, we all got you from rookie to...

5903
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:12,160
We almost got you the gold.

5904
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:15,540
I think we can actually...

5905
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:17,400
I can actually go gold.

5906
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:18,500
Yeah, I think so too.

5907
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:20,020
I think Ditto can get to plat.

5908
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:21,360
And then like...

5909
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,680
Yeah, we can get to gold.

5910
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,140
Oh my god.

5911
02:23:27,140 --> 02:23:28,000
Plat is crazy.

5912
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:29,000
Yeah.

5913
02:23:29,060 --> 02:23:30,800
How is your rank now?

5914
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:31,760
I'm gold 3.

5915
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:34,300
I'm plat.

5916
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:35,440
I'm plat 4.

5917
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:36,440
I think you're plat 4.

5918
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:37,880
I'm almost plat 3, I think.

5919
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:39,900
No, aren't you plat 3, I think?

5920
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:41,460
I am.

5921
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:42,760
I mean silver 3.

5922
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,680
My account is only gold 1.

5923
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:47,800
Wait, really?

5924
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:51,500
Yes, I don't play rank.

5925
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,160
But you're about to get...

5926
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:53,780
plat now.

5927
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:55,940
Alright.

5928
02:23:58,780 --> 02:23:59,400
Do we have anybody?

5929
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,200
We have a squad here.

5930
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:04,000
Not with us though.

5931
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:05,500
Yay!

5932
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,000
It's like, hey, we can kill them.

5933
02:24:08,060 --> 02:24:09,960
If we die, we have heal.

5934
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:12,900
If we die, we have hero.

5935
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:15,940
I'll immediately res you right on them.

5936
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:16,620
Yeah.

5937
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:20,160
We land on their heads and punch them.

5938
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:22,480
We don't need guns.

5939
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:23,720
Oh my god.

5940
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:25,460
Cooties, right?

5941
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:26,540
Oh my god.

5942
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:29,820
Give them extra cooties.

5943
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:33,460
Alright, let's see.

5944
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:35,420
Ugh, I bet they're not gonna die.

5945
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:35,900
I don't like guns though.

5946
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:39,020
Where were they?

5947
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:39,760
The ship?

5948
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:41,700
No, they're at the big mod.

5949
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:43,140
Big mod, okay.

5950
02:24:44,860 --> 02:24:45,860
So we're fine.

5951
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:47,980
Because they have to get big mod stuff.

5952
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,180
Finally, finally, finally.

5953
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:52,660
I can remember how to play Apex.

5954
02:24:56,300 --> 02:24:59,340
When she learned how to run, she learned how to play.

5955
02:25:01,220 --> 02:25:01,740
True.

5956
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:04,220
Why is Pathfinder so heavy?

5957
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:05,880
Yeah.

5958
02:25:06,820 --> 02:25:08,340
Guys, am I running?

5959
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:09,080
Am I running?

5960
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:15,040
Why does Apex feel different?

5961
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:16,680
I'm so slow.

5962
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:22,000
I need energy ammo.

5963
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:24,020
I feel like...

5964
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:24,580
um...

5965
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:28,760
Horizon is faster than Pathfinder when...

5966
02:25:28,760 --> 02:25:30,380
when running.

5967
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:30,840
Really?

5968
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:31,720
I thought so.

5969
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:32,500
I think it's just the animation.

5970
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:34,980
They purposely like make the animation...

5971
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:37,840
Like, because like Gibby feels slow, but he's the same speed.

5972
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:38,380
Yeah.

5973
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:42,240
It's just they made his animation so slow.

5974
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:43,320
That it looks slow.

5975
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:44,120
I see.

5976
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:44,760
Oh wait, they're here.

5977
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:45,280
They're right here.

5978
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:46,100
Oh my god.

5979
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:50,500
Where are they?

5980
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:51,420
Here.

5981
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:52,880
Behind the rock.

5982
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:56,680
Flash, flash, flash.

5983
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:57,500
I'm pushing.

5984
02:25:57,640 --> 02:25:58,100
I'm getting one for you.

5985
02:25:58,100 --> 02:25:58,620
He's so low.

5986
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,160
He's so low.

5987
02:25:59,260 --> 02:25:59,860
He's so low.

5988
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:05,480
Oh my god.

5989
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:06,200
He was so low.

5990
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:06,520
Oh my god.

5991
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,100
He's so low.

5992
02:26:07,240 --> 02:26:07,840
I'm gonna push.

5993
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:09,980
His teammates are this side.

5994
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:10,600
His teammates are here.

5995
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:11,820
Okay, I'm getting this.

5996
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:13,160
Oh nice.

5997
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:16,300
Where did I get shot by?

5998
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:17,540
Oh, you see his...

5999
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,060
Their teammates are coming.

6000
02:26:20,660 --> 02:26:22,080
Okay, I'm going with Diddle.

6001
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:23,400
I cracked one of them.

6002
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:26,060
I'm shield selling.

6003
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:26,540
I'm shield selling.

6004
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:27,400
I'm not with you, Diddle.

6005
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:29,880
Okay, I'm coming, Diddle.

6006
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:32,020
I knocked one.

6007
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:32,820
I knocked one.

6008
02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:33,880
Okay, I'm coming.

6009
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:35,700
I'm trying to see where they are.

6010
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:36,820
Over here.

6011
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:39,080
I'm still not so low.

6012
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:41,260
I knocked two.

6013
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:43,260
I almost knocked him.

6014
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,160
1v3, Diddle.

6015
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:44,660
1v3.

6016
02:26:47,740 --> 02:26:48,460
Okay, okay.

6017
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:49,060
Okay, okay.

6018
02:26:50,660 --> 02:26:51,240
On me?

6019
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:55,080
They're late.

6020
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:55,480
They're late.

6021
02:26:55,700 --> 02:26:56,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6022
02:26:56,060 --> 02:26:56,420
Flash.

6023
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,260
On me.

6024
02:26:58,360 --> 02:26:59,340
Oh, here, here, here.

6025
02:26:59,460 --> 02:26:59,660
Nice.

6026
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:00,320
Nice.

6027
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:01,980
Oh they have lifeline.

6028
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:04,300
Yeah, they have lifeline.

6029
02:27:04,300 --> 02:27:04,760
Yeah, they have lifeline.

6030
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:07,400
Oh, they have purple.

6031
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:08,800
Purple Spitfire.

6032
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:10,400
Nice.

6033
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:11,560
Spitfire.

6034
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:12,200
Here.

6035
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:15,420
Yeah!

6036
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:17,340
That's right.

6037
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:19,400
They tried to push us, but they died.

6038
02:27:21,060 --> 02:27:21,940
How dare they.

6039
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:23,420
They shouldn't have shot at us.

6040
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:25,620
We would have left them alone if they didn't shoot us.

6041
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:27,660
Good.

6042
02:27:29,060 --> 02:27:29,540
Oh.

6043
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:29,980
Oh.

6044
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:33,200
Wait, the cure package is right next to us.

6045
02:27:33,340 --> 02:27:33,600
Yeah.

6046
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:34,660
That's so good.

6047
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:35,540
What's that?

6048
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:37,340
It's a powder.

6049
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:39,080
Does anyone want it?

6050
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,220
You want it?

6051
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,020
No, I already got two.

6052
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:44,140
Last game I got two red guns.

6053
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:45,120
So I'm willing to...

6054
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:46,540
Okay, okay, I will use this.

6055
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:49,180
Alright.

6056
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:50,660
Nice.

6057
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:53,100
Oh, I have my own package too.

6058
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:55,060
Is there scope?

6059
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:56,360
Scope?

6060
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:56,820
No.

6061
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:57,960
I want a bag.

6062
02:27:58,480 --> 02:27:59,400
I don't have...

6063
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:00,780
Maybe there's a bag in my package.

6064
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:01,920
I have two scope.

6065
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:05,140
I'll find one.

6066
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:06,580
There's three bats here.

6067
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:07,360
Does anyone want them?

6068
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:09,800
Yes.

6069
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:10,460
I got it.

6070
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:12,260
Yeah, I have four bats here.

6071
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:13,800
I will get one.

6072
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:15,800
Alright, let's go.

6073
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:17,800
How many do you have here?

6074
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:19,060
Yeah, I have four bats.

6075
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:19,400
Battery?

6076
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:20,160
Yeah, how many bats?

6077
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:20,840
Two.

6078
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:22,560
We grab one for her.

6079
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:23,740
I'll grab it for her.

6080
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:24,120
Okay.

6081
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:25,240
I have an extra slot.

6082
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:26,440
Wow.

6083
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,340
I will get one for myself.

6084
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:29,100
Okay.

6085
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:29,360
Wow.

6086
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:31,740
Wow, Ditto.

6087
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:36,120
Ditto, you're really greedy.

6088
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:39,380
I have four.

6089
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:40,980
Yeah, but you could have...

6090
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:41,320
I have four now.

6091
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:42,500
Yeah, I have four too.

6092
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,980
I grabbed it for you.

6093
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:44,940
Thank you.

6094
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,920
See, this is what separates me from Ditto.

6095
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:49,240
I'm actually a good person.

6096
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:50,720
Yeah, I bought this for you.

6097
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:52,780
No.

6098
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:54,260
Lily.

6099
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:55,620
Lily?

6100
02:28:57,220 --> 02:28:57,700
No.

6101
02:28:57,860 --> 02:28:58,500
It's okay.

6102
02:28:59,100 --> 02:28:59,360
Don't worry.

6103
02:29:00,480 --> 02:29:01,400
If you want.

6104
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:02,600
If you want.

6105
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:02,980
She does.

6106
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:03,800
She deserves it.

6107
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:04,120
No.

6108
02:29:04,840 --> 02:29:05,360
No.

6109
02:29:05,420 --> 02:29:05,940
No.

6110
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:07,400
There's another bat.

6111
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:08,520
Wait, there was another bat here.

6112
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:11,180
I'm full now.

6113
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:12,300
Alright.

6114
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:13,360
Where do we go?

6115
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:15,000
Well, thank Doki Bird.

6116
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:16,280
Um, good game, captain.

6117
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:18,440
It was a hard race, sir.

6118
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:19,000
Alright.

6119
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:19,360
Okay.

6120
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:20,080
Okay, Akiyo.

6121
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:20,800
Okay.

6122
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:23,500
Where should we go?

6123
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:25,340
Okay, here.

6124
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:26,380
Um...

6125
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:28,200
There's no...

6126
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:28,920
Wait.

6127
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,080
Wait.

6128
02:29:29,080 --> 02:29:29,200
Wait.

6129
02:29:29,380 --> 02:29:29,520
What?

6130
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:30,980
What?

6131
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:31,320
What?

6132
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:32,560
What happened?

6133
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:33,220
Did you punch me?

6134
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:33,660
No.

6135
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:34,480
What happened?

6136
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:36,620
What happened?

6137
02:29:37,300 --> 02:29:39,460
I thought there was an enemy.

6138
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:40,120
Oh.

6139
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:41,240
Wait, why?

6140
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:42,380
Why did you think it was an enemy?

6141
02:29:42,380 --> 02:29:42,640
You punched me.

6142
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:43,460
You punched me.

6143
02:29:43,480 --> 02:29:43,900
No, I didn't.

6144
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:44,920
I didn't punch you.

6145
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:47,200
I thought I got shot.

6146
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:47,820
Nobody.

6147
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:50,060
Wait, there's somebody all the way there.

6148
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:50,380
You got shot?

6149
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,060
I thought you...

6150
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:54,960
Yeah.

6151
02:29:55,660 --> 02:29:56,100
Yeah.

6152
02:29:56,900 --> 02:29:58,840
Ditto immediately turned around.

6153
02:29:58,920 --> 02:29:59,060
I thought you got shot.

6154
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:00,400
I didn't know he was there.

6155
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:00,620
It's like...

6156
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:03,080
Yes?

6157
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:03,160
Everything in my house is...

6158
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:05,880
She freaked out.

6159
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:06,360
She was like Wait.

6160
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:06,900
Wait.

6161
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:10,480
I heard a, like a...

6162
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:13,180
I heard the sound like a gun sound.

6163
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:13,660
Yeah.

6164
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:16,000
It's my left line air loom.

6165
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:17,520
It's the air loom.

6166
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:17,740
Icy.

6167
02:30:19,580 --> 02:30:20,860
It's so noisy.

6168
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:22,680
Your air loom is so noisy.

6169
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:23,820
Yeah.

6170
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:28,420
Wait, there's no here!

6171
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:32,160
No lie, no lie, no lie!

6172
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,200
I like how...

6173
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:40,560
I like how Ditto was like, really?

6174
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:43,140
Over here.

6175
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,320
Oh my god, he's so low.

6176
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:50,500
Wait, what?

6177
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,540
One guy with me!

6178
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:52,280
How?

6179
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:54,260
How can he get inside?

6180
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:56,660
Can you get in?

6181
02:30:59,740 --> 02:31:01,020
Holy shit!

6182
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:02,720
In one hit!

6183
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:04,400
We're all so low!

6184
02:31:05,560 --> 02:31:07,020
Oh my god!

6185
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:10,540
Oh, I'm gonna grab that terrible trophy.

6186
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:11,840
How can he get inside?

6187
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:14,000
That was so scary.

6188
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:17,000
That was so scary, that's why I'm here.

6189
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:20,120
We could've all died from the nade right there.

6190
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:22,960
I will kill them, I will kill them.

6191
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:23,940
Right here, right here.

6192
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:24,420
Okay, go!

6193
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:25,740
Go, go, go!

6194
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:26,280
Go kill them!

6195
02:31:26,640 --> 02:31:27,500
Go, kill them!

6196
02:31:27,580 --> 02:31:28,140
Go, go, go!

6197
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:29,940
Why are you shooting me?

6198
02:31:29,960 --> 02:31:31,040
I thought you were gonna kill him!

6199
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:34,220
I killed one.

6200
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:36,240
I'm mad, I'm madding.

6201
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:38,660
Last one, last one.

6202
02:31:38,860 --> 02:31:40,000
Lifeland ran, he ran, he ran.

6203
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:40,720
You guys got it.

6204
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:42,180
We can get him.

6205
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,240
I don't think so, he's so far.

6206
02:31:45,140 --> 02:31:45,500
Everyone!

6207
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:47,280
Oh shit!

6208
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:49,360
We can go chase them.

6209
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:49,840
Okay.

6210
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:50,400
Okay.

6211
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:51,660
That poor guy.

6212
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:53,180
Okay, I saw it, I saw it.

6213
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:54,580
I see him, I see him.

6214
02:31:54,580 --> 02:31:56,560
I saw it, I see him, I see him.

6215
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:58,160
Here I go, I saw it.

6216
02:31:58,600 --> 02:31:59,200
He's going right.

6217
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:02,040
He's right here.

6218
02:32:04,300 --> 02:32:05,040
Here, here, here.

6219
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:06,260
Hey.

6220
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:07,760
Hey.

6221
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:13,540
You almost died.

6222
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,120
You almost died.

6223
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:16,200
It was worth it.

6224
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:18,620
I got the shock stick melee.

6225
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:21,400
That poor guy.

6226
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:24,640
He's running from the cooties.

6227
02:32:25,620 --> 02:32:26,920
I'm walking down.

6228
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:29,220
Got the cooties.

6229
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:32,680
Wait, I want more energy armor.

6230
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:36,000
I have to go back.

6231
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:36,640
Okay.

6232
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:38,360
I got gold res now.

6233
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:39,960
Oh nice.

6234
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:40,340
Yeah.

6235
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:44,600
Oh, was there two teams?

6236
02:32:44,780 --> 02:32:45,560
You always get gold every time.

6237
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:46,700
Yeah, that's right.

6238
02:32:46,900 --> 02:32:47,580
I'm gaming.

6239
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:49,340
Wasn't there like two teams?

6240
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:50,960
I thought it was two teams.

6241
02:32:50,980 --> 02:32:51,400
No, there's one.

6242
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:51,900
Yeah, yeah.

6243
02:32:52,360 --> 02:32:53,260
Oh, there's one.

6244
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:53,820
There's nobody.

6245
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:54,680
Oh, okay.

6246
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:56,560
They were just super split up then.

6247
02:32:56,680 --> 02:32:56,860
Yeah, where's Pathfinder?

6248
02:32:57,720 --> 02:32:58,960
Yeah, where is his body?

6249
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:02,060
Where's Pathfinder?

6250
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,000
This box.

6251
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:03,580
Oh, here, here.

6252
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:05,340
Oh my god, he crawled so far.

6253
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:07,300
How did he get here?

6254
02:33:09,380 --> 02:33:09,820
Oh my god.

6255
02:33:09,820 --> 02:33:10,340
Oh my god.

6256
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,020
He crawled so far, little guy.

6257
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:14,000
Yeah, he was trying to survive.

6258
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:14,740
Yeah.

6259
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:16,080
He was trying to survive.

6260
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:18,140
He has a respawn beacon too.

6261
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:19,140
Oh my god.

6262
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:19,320
Oh my god.

6263
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:20,540
Yeah, we need that.

6264
02:33:20,580 --> 02:33:22,820
I think there's a squad there.

6265
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:24,820
Okay, let me go check.

6266
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:25,420
You know what?

6267
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:25,660
I'll go.

6268
02:33:25,660 --> 02:33:27,800
Yeah, I'll escort in the fragment.

6269
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:29,380
Nobody here.

6270
02:33:30,020 --> 02:33:30,780
Let me check.

6271
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:32,640
I'm going.

6272
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:35,080
Yeah, I can hear them fighting.

6273
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:38,740
There's somebody rezzing.

6274
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:39,880
Okay.

6275
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:41,000
And they're fighting here.

6276
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:42,560
Okay, okay, we can go there.

6277
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:43,860
What the...

6278
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:45,200
Oh, they fight.

6279
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:48,480
They fight.

6280
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:48,720
Oh, they fight.

6281
02:33:48,940 --> 02:33:49,220
They fight.

6282
02:33:49,220 --> 02:33:49,300
Okay, okay, okay.

6283
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:51,940
Donkey is really scary!

6284
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:53,880
Oh my god!

6285
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:54,460
Right?

6286
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:54,700
Right?

6287
02:33:55,080 --> 02:33:55,600
Stop!

6288
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:56,760
Scary!

6289
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,580
Have lifeline!

6290
02:33:58,720 --> 02:33:59,300
Have lifeline!

6291
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:00,640
It's gonna be so bad!

6292
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,400
I think they already said it.

6293
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:04,000
I'll use...

6294
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,300
We're heading over.

6295
02:34:06,260 --> 02:34:07,040
Follow me!

6296
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:07,460
Follow me!

6297
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:08,860
Yeah, we're coming.

6298
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:09,300
We're almost there.

6299
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:12,340
Okay, all cracked!

6300
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:12,720
Alright.

6301
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:13,460
Go, Ditto!

6302
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:13,760
Go!

6303
02:34:14,020 --> 02:34:14,880
Kill all of them!

6304
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:15,820
1v3!

6305
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:16,240
1v3!

6306
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:18,460
I'm getting across!

6307
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:19,020
I'm getting across!

6308
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:21,980
I'm on a cross!

6309
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:26,520
Almost cracked Pathfinder!

6310
02:34:27,440 --> 02:34:28,100
I got one!

6311
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:29,340
Last guy!

6312
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:29,760
The other guy!

6313
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:30,340
I got him!

6314
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:30,440
I got him!

6315
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:31,240
Oh my god!

6316
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,260
Oh, thank god!

6317
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:32,820
Thank god!

6318
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:34,100
On me!

6319
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:34,380
On me!

6320
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:34,760
Last guy!

6321
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:35,520
Okay!

6322
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:36,180
I got the bat!

6323
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:36,600
I got the bat!

6324
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:36,820
Right here!

6325
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,140
Right here!

6326
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:39,200
He's not low, but he's by himself.

6327
02:34:39,220 --> 02:34:39,580
Oh, nice!

6328
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:40,960
Nice!

6329
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:41,240
Nice!

6330
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:41,960
See?

6331
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:42,820
So easy!

6332
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,520
I'm gonna grab the car, but...

6333
02:34:44,520 --> 02:34:44,680
Wait!

6334
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:45,900
The other squad...

6335
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:46,220
Like...

6336
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:48,220
There's another one just res nearby.

6337
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:49,880
They all res here.

6338
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:51,800
They all wanna die.

6339
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,560
Okay, I have to lose some stuff.

6340
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:54,640
Yeah, me too.

6341
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:58,380
Alright, let's see...

6342
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:00,340
Is there any extra light?

6343
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:00,900
Oh, there is.

6344
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:03,760
Let me check.

6345
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:06,380
Where's the last body?

6346
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:06,960
Oh, there it is.

6347
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:10,840
No!

6348
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:12,320
Nobody has...

6349
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:14,520
Nobody has Barrel Stabilizer.

6350
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:15,920
What do you want?

6351
02:35:16,120 --> 02:35:16,780
I see them.

6352
02:35:16,820 --> 02:35:17,640
They're all the way over there.

6353
02:35:17,740 --> 02:35:18,520
I made the...

6354
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:18,900
Okay, okay.

6355
02:35:20,060 --> 02:35:20,500
Let's go.

6356
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:21,480
Okay.

6357
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:23,780
They're all the way over there.

6358
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:25,040
Okay, we jump there?

6359
02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:25,680
Yeah, yeah.

6360
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:27,280
We just head over there.

6361
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:27,840
Yay!

6362
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:29,400
Oh, be careful!

6363
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:30,280
They have Devotion!

6364
02:35:30,820 --> 02:35:31,280
Oh, yeah.

6365
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:31,580
They do.

6366
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:31,900
They do.

6367
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:33,700
Careful.

6368
02:35:33,980 --> 02:35:35,420
They're like all the way over there.

6369
02:35:35,480 --> 02:35:35,500
I think they're there.

6370
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:36,080
Really?

6371
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:38,500
No, I see them now.

6372
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:39,000
No one there.

6373
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:39,740
They're there.

6374
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:40,220
They're up the hill.

6375
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:40,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6376
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:40,960
Over there.

6377
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:41,240
Over there.

6378
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:41,400
Yeah.

6379
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:43,060
Pretty far.

6380
02:35:44,140 --> 02:35:44,500
I think they're there.

6381
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,140
Yeah, I'm heading closer.

6382
02:35:46,300 --> 02:35:46,800
Yeah, they're far.

6383
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:47,420
Blue armor!

6384
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:47,960
Blue armor!

6385
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:48,340
Blue armor!

6386
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:49,180
Oh, they're baby.

6387
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:49,560
They're baby.

6388
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:50,820
They have blue armor.

6389
02:35:51,980 --> 02:35:52,600
Yeah, they're running.

6390
02:35:52,680 --> 02:35:53,040
They're running.

6391
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:53,220
They're running.

6392
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:53,400
They're all...

6393
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:53,600
Okay.

6394
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:53,660
Oh, wait.

6395
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:54,400
They have purple armor.

6396
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:55,580
He has purple armor.

6397
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:57,880
Yeah, one of them is blue armor.

6398
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:00,720
The purple armor is almost K.

6399
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:01,960
Okay.

6400
02:36:02,580 --> 02:36:02,940
Okay.

6401
02:36:03,160 --> 02:36:03,740
Doggy, be careful.

6402
02:36:06,320 --> 02:36:07,040
I'm behind you.

6403
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:07,300
Oh!

6404
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:07,860
Okay.

6405
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:08,500
They...

6406
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:09,360
They missed their ult.

6407
02:36:09,380 --> 02:36:09,920
They missed their ult.

6408
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:11,900
Wait, the next team over there.

6409
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:13,120
Okay, be careful.

6410
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:13,460
Be careful.

6411
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:14,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6412
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:14,480
We might have to go.

6413
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:14,920
We might as well wait.

6414
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,080
They're getting shot.

6415
02:36:16,340 --> 02:36:18,140
Yeah, they're getting shot by that team.

6416
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:20,400
Oh, if...

6417
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:22,280
Oh, that team's gonna get me, babe.

6418
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:23,340
I want that spot.

6419
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:25,380
That team's gonna get it.

6420
02:36:27,220 --> 02:36:29,420
Wait, I almost have EMP, Ditto.

6421
02:36:29,540 --> 02:36:29,800
Oh, nice.

6422
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:30,560
I almost have it.

6423
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:32,060
Just give me a second.

6424
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:34,160
Okay, I can EMP them.

6425
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:35,640
Wait, what?

6426
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:35,940
Oh, my god.

6427
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:37,960
It's pretty hard to push from here.

6428
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:39,660
Yeah, because there's a team to our left right here.

6429
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:40,240
Okay.

6430
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:41,300
That one's looking at us.

6431
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:42,280
It's okay.

6432
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:44,480
Maybe we have to...

6433
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:44,980
We have to wait.

6434
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:46,060
Yeah.

6435
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:49,360
No, I want to see how I can stick them.

6436
02:36:49,500 --> 02:36:50,240
Oh, my god.

6437
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:51,040
Okay, I know.

6438
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:52,660
I know how to fight.

6439
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:53,340
How?

6440
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:53,960
Kill that team first.

6441
02:36:54,260 --> 02:36:56,140
The left team or left team?

6442
02:36:56,400 --> 02:36:57,080
Left team.

6443
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:57,440
Okay.

6444
02:36:57,520 --> 02:36:58,440
Kill that left team first.

6445
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:00,100
Yeah, you pissed us off.

6446
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:02,140
Yeah, go, Dad.

6447
02:37:02,220 --> 02:37:02,600
You made us angry.

6448
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:05,840
Yeah, that's right.

6449
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:07,780
I think the above squad is kind of...

6450
02:37:07,780 --> 02:37:08,980
Yeah, we can pull left.

6451
02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:09,580
Yeah.

6452
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:09,660
Let me...

6453
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:10,860
There's still one team that's missing.

6454
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:14,040
Where did that last team go?

6455
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:14,460
I think that's the last one.

6456
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:15,480
They keep hitting us.

6457
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:15,740
Oh, here, here.

6458
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:16,220
Another team.

6459
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:16,560
Here, here.

6460
02:37:16,620 --> 02:37:17,100
I saw them.

6461
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:17,840
Okay.

6462
02:37:18,820 --> 02:37:19,140
130.

6463
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:22,000
I don't know who it was, but...

6464
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:22,320
Oh, my god.

6465
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:22,680
Two.

6466
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:23,080
Two.

6467
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:23,720
Bangalore.

6468
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:24,640
Bangalore passed by them.

6469
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:25,600
Loba.

6470
02:37:25,660 --> 02:37:26,140
I broke Loba.

6471
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:30,420
Oh, they're over here.

6472
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:32,480
One is up here.

6473
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:33,000
One is up here.

6474
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:34,620
Okay, I'll go with Ditto.

6475
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:35,980
One is up here, by the way.

6476
02:37:38,100 --> 02:37:38,980
Bangalore is low, too.

6477
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:40,860
Yeah, I'm pushing up.

6478
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:42,260
He's in here somewhere.

6479
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:43,920
I think he ran, ran.

6480
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:45,280
I think he ran, ran.

6481
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:45,720
I think he ran, ran.

6482
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:46,500
Yeah, he ran.

6483
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6484
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:47,600
Wait, yeah.

6485
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:49,640
I'm pushing.

6486
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:51,460
Okay.

6487
02:37:52,320 --> 02:37:53,120
He got it.

6488
02:37:53,240 --> 02:37:54,080
I'm thirsting.

6489
02:37:54,080 --> 02:37:54,620
I'm thirsting.

6490
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:56,820
All right.

6491
02:37:57,380 --> 02:37:58,160
Pushing up.

6492
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:00,720
This team...

6493
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:02,140
This team is so annoying.

6494
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:02,440
You know what?

6495
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:04,040
I'm gonna EMP them right now.

6496
02:38:05,140 --> 02:38:05,960
Yeah, fuck this team.

6497
02:38:05,960 --> 02:38:06,920
Wait, they ran.

6498
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,620
I'm gonna EMP them anyway.

6499
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:09,080
Okay.

6500
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:11,200
Nice.

6501
02:38:11,220 --> 02:38:11,880
Nice EMP.

6502
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:12,520
Nice.

6503
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:13,580
It's a full team.

6504
02:38:13,780 --> 02:38:14,300
Yeah, they're red.

6505
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:14,880
Red armor.

6506
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:15,560
That other team is red.

6507
02:38:15,560 --> 02:38:15,700
Yeah, they're red.

6508
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:18,320
I'm gonna heal my...

6509
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:21,040
Can you give me some doors?

6510
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:22,340
Yeah, I can.

6511
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:23,940
I'll come back to you.

6512
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:24,500
Oh, they have a...

6513
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:26,440
They have a Crypto, too.

6514
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:27,800
They're cheating.

6515
02:38:27,860 --> 02:38:28,220
Okay, fine.

6516
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:28,920
Fine.

6517
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:29,520
Fine.

6518
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:30,400
Fine.

6519
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:32,040
Oh, my God.

6520
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:35,040
They also have a Crypto.

6521
02:38:35,140 --> 02:38:35,240
We have beta Crypto.

6522
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:36,800
We have beta Crypto.

6523
02:38:36,860 --> 02:38:37,300
Wait, wait, wait.

6524
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:38,020
Did you see that?

6525
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:38,580
To our left.

6526
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:39,020
Yeah.

6527
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:40,140
Yeah.

6528
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:40,980
Doki, you got it.

6529
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:42,120
Wait, where?

6530
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:44,040
On me.

6531
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:44,280
On me.

6532
02:38:44,340 --> 02:38:44,520
On me.

6533
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:46,380
They're pushing.

6534
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:47,120
They're pushing us.

6535
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:49,000
I got him.

6536
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:49,260
I got him.

6537
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:49,580
I got him.

6538
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:50,000
No, it's okay.

6539
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:52,000
Yeah, that lifeline.

6540
02:38:52,060 --> 02:38:52,500
I was like, what?

6541
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:53,700
When you did the scan.

6542
02:38:53,700 --> 02:38:54,700
Yeah, you did the scan.

6543
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:56,240
I was like, I need to scan that.

6544
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,560
What was he doing there?

6545
02:38:59,040 --> 02:38:59,740
Come on, let's try.

6546
02:39:00,100 --> 02:39:01,160
Oh, I don't have shield cells.

6547
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:02,200
I'm gonna grab some shield.

6548
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:02,920
I got shield cells now.

6549
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:03,980
Okay.

6550
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:04,540
Can you help out?

6551
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:06,720
I have 75.

6552
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:07,700
No, 10%.

6553
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:08,600
Oh, lifeline.

6554
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:09,020
Lifeline.

6555
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:09,300
Okay.

6556
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:10,340
I have 10%.

6557
02:39:11,060 --> 02:39:11,500
Oh, wait.

6558
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:12,720
What?

6559
02:39:12,740 --> 02:39:12,920
What?

6560
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:13,280
What?

6561
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:13,540
What?

6562
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:14,820
I'm gonna try to get him.

6563
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:15,020
Don't worry.

6564
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:15,380
I'm clad.

6565
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:15,680
Oh my god.

6566
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:16,660
Wait, what the fuck?

6567
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:16,900
Oh.

6568
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:18,640
No shooting.

6569
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:18,900
We're shooting you?

6570
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:19,680
Over here.

6571
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:21,340
I cracked him.

6572
02:39:21,900 --> 02:39:23,180
Be careful left side.

6573
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:24,720
There's one guy.

6574
02:39:25,580 --> 02:39:26,600
This is two teams.

6575
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:28,040
This is two and then this is three.

6576
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:29,120
Okay.

6577
02:39:30,180 --> 02:39:30,580
Yeah.

6578
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:31,720
I'm packaged now.

6579
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:33,780
I can get cover for us.

6580
02:39:34,500 --> 02:39:36,300
We need a push up for this.

6581
02:39:37,660 --> 02:39:38,360
Oh, wait, wait.

6582
02:39:38,380 --> 02:39:38,720
Drop, drop.

6583
02:39:41,020 --> 02:39:42,260
God, the other team is...

6584
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:43,840
Okay, I have EMP.

6585
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,300
I crypto dropped.

6586
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:44,500
I got EMP.

6587
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:47,680
I'm batting.

6588
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:47,980
I'm batting.

6589
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:48,380
I'm batting.

6590
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:50,360
I'm batting.

6591
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:50,380
I'm EMP.

6592
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:51,140
I'm gonna EMP now.

6593
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:51,580
I'm sailing.

6594
02:39:51,740 --> 02:39:52,080
I'm sailing.

6595
02:39:52,180 --> 02:39:52,460
I'm sailing.

6596
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:52,960
Okay.

6597
02:39:53,860 --> 02:39:55,260
I have a bass here.

6598
02:39:55,320 --> 02:39:56,000
We need some.

6599
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:57,520
Oh my god.

6600
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:58,200
I need that barrel staple.

6601
02:39:58,260 --> 02:39:58,460
I'm...

6602
02:39:59,260 --> 02:39:59,580
Okay.

6603
02:39:59,960 --> 02:40:00,880
Oh, is that yours?

6604
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:01,400
EMP it again?

6605
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:02,000
Mine.

6606
02:40:06,080 --> 02:40:06,440
I'm going.

6607
02:40:06,540 --> 02:40:07,180
I'm going to Doki.

6608
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,000
Yeah.

6609
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:08,700
I don't know where they are.

6610
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:10,120
I'm going inside.

6611
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:11,000
You know what?

6612
02:40:11,620 --> 02:40:12,200
I'm inside.

6613
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:13,580
One here.

6614
02:40:13,660 --> 02:40:14,000
One here.

6615
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:14,280
One here.

6616
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:17,520
I think I'm...

6617
02:40:18,220 --> 02:40:18,700
I can't.

6618
02:40:18,760 --> 02:40:19,100
I can't.

6619
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:19,160
I got him.

6620
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:19,460
I got him.

6621
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:19,680
I got him.

6622
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:20,040
Nice one.

6623
02:40:20,140 --> 02:40:20,460
Nice one.

6624
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,140
We got...

6625
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:23,100
I'm thirsting.

6626
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:23,520
I'm thirsting this.

6627
02:40:28,330 --> 02:40:28,990
Wait, they're on top?

6628
02:40:31,310 --> 02:40:31,790
I thirsted.

6629
02:40:32,350 --> 02:40:32,870
I met this.

6630
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:33,110
I'm sorry.

6631
02:40:33,150 --> 02:40:33,590
I got the lifeline.

6632
02:40:33,830 --> 02:40:34,190
I got one.

6633
02:40:34,330 --> 02:40:34,570
I got one.

6634
02:40:34,630 --> 02:40:34,810
There.

6635
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:35,190
There.

6636
02:40:35,430 --> 02:40:35,670
There.

6637
02:40:35,670 --> 02:40:35,870
There.

6638
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:36,050
There.

6639
02:40:36,050 --> 02:40:36,130
There.

6640
02:40:36,130 --> 02:40:36,250
There.

6641
02:40:36,250 --> 02:40:36,350
There.

6642
02:40:36,350 --> 02:40:36,490
Full dead.

6643
02:40:36,510 --> 02:40:36,750
Full dead.

6644
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:37,310
Full dead.

6645
02:40:48,030 --> 02:40:48,330
Okay.

6646
02:40:48,370 --> 02:40:51,730
It should be two because we killed the lifeline member from that team.

6647
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:52,530
Wait, I don't...

6648
02:40:52,530 --> 02:40:53,310
Okay, nice.

6649
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:54,030
Yeah, we...

6650
02:40:54,030 --> 02:40:54,990
Let me go scan them.

6651
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:55,890
Really?

6652
02:40:56,030 --> 02:40:56,490
Yeah, we have...

6653
02:40:56,490 --> 02:40:57,530
We have crypto.

6654
02:40:57,670 --> 02:40:57,950
Let's just wait.

6655
02:40:57,950 --> 02:40:58,090
Oh, yeah.

6656
02:40:58,090 --> 02:40:58,770
We have crypto.

6657
02:41:01,590 --> 02:41:02,150
Yeah, two.

6658
02:41:02,270 --> 02:41:02,570
Two.

6659
02:41:03,210 --> 02:41:03,630
Two.

6660
02:41:03,630 --> 02:41:03,990
Three.

6661
02:41:04,210 --> 02:41:04,550
Three.

6662
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:04,870
Wait.

6663
02:41:04,870 --> 02:41:06,130
Who the fuck is that lifeline?

6664
02:41:06,550 --> 02:41:09,670
The lifeline was the team we killed earlier.

6665
02:41:10,350 --> 02:41:11,270
We just wait.

6666
02:41:11,370 --> 02:41:13,070
Wait for them to push us.

6667
02:41:13,310 --> 02:41:13,630
Yeah.

6668
02:41:13,770 --> 02:41:13,830
Sure.

6669
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:15,730
Oh my god.

6670
02:41:15,910 --> 02:41:16,050
I...

6671
02:41:16,050 --> 02:41:17,850
I don't have a lot.

6672
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:19,190
They may have Ashe.

6673
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:19,530
They may have Ashe.

6674
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:19,930
Wait a minute.

6675
02:41:22,070 --> 02:41:22,470
Okay.

6676
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:24,050
I will try to push them.

6677
02:41:24,050 --> 02:41:24,110
I cracked them.

6678
02:41:24,250 --> 02:41:24,690
I cracked two.

6679
02:41:24,910 --> 02:41:25,310
Okay.

6680
02:41:25,370 --> 02:41:26,170
I'm pushing.

6681
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:26,630
I'm pushing.

6682
02:41:26,730 --> 02:41:27,290
I'm pushing.

6683
02:41:27,430 --> 02:41:28,210
I'll just make...

6684
02:41:28,210 --> 02:41:30,170
I'm gonna queue up and troll my lane.

6685
02:41:30,270 --> 02:41:30,770
First for...

6686
02:41:30,770 --> 02:41:31,690
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

6687
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:32,530
He's here.

6688
02:41:34,030 --> 02:41:34,870
Cracked, the flash...

6689
02:41:34,870 --> 02:41:35,890
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

6690
02:41:38,990 --> 02:41:39,390
Um...

6691
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:41,310
Crack, crack, crack.

6692
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:42,570
Horizon.

6693
02:41:43,210 --> 02:41:44,270
Horizon 1, Horizon 1.

6694
02:41:44,410 --> 02:41:44,750
Last one.

6695
02:41:44,830 --> 02:41:45,150
Last one.

6696
02:41:45,210 --> 02:41:45,250
Horizon.

6697
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:45,890
Okay.

6698
02:41:46,330 --> 02:41:46,730
Yeah.

6699
02:41:46,850 --> 02:41:47,710
You won again.

6700
02:41:47,710 --> 02:41:47,830
Yeah.

6701
02:41:47,850 --> 02:41:48,350
Wow!

6702
02:41:48,350 --> 02:41:49,210
Another win!

6703
02:41:49,730 --> 02:41:50,670
Girl squad!

6704
02:41:50,850 --> 02:41:51,670
Cootie squad!

6705
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:52,250
Cootie squad!

6706
02:41:55,550 --> 02:41:56,590
Cooties are too strong.

6707
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:02,130
Nice one!

6708
02:42:02,510 --> 02:42:03,190
Nice!

6709
02:42:03,190 --> 02:42:04,010
Another win!

6710
02:42:04,330 --> 02:42:05,030
Oh my god!

6711
02:42:05,130 --> 02:42:06,370
Who can stop us?

6712
02:42:10,110 --> 02:42:12,970
Neat hand sanitizer.

6713
02:42:12,970 --> 02:42:14,010
Oh my god!

6714
02:42:14,090 --> 02:42:14,670
Me?

6715
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:19,490
Another girl squad can only stop us.

6716
02:42:24,670 --> 02:42:26,030
Another girl squad.

6717
02:42:26,030 --> 02:42:27,170
Four in a row.

6718
02:42:27,470 --> 02:42:28,170
Holy shit.

6719
02:42:29,790 --> 02:42:31,830
Four wins in a row.

6720
02:42:31,910 --> 02:42:33,030
We are so good.

6721
02:42:33,330 --> 02:42:33,930
Wait,

6722
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:39,130
Ditto, are you almost flat?

6723
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:40,930
Wait, what rank are you?

6724
02:42:40,930 --> 02:42:44,570
I think... I'm still gold too.

6725
02:42:45,370 --> 02:42:47,390
We'll see here what our rank is.

6726
02:42:47,650 --> 02:42:48,650
Because we got four games.

6727
02:42:48,650 --> 02:42:49,290
Aren't you gold three?

6728
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:50,090
Yeah.

6729
02:42:50,270 --> 02:42:51,910
Because we got four games in a row.

6730
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:53,370
We won four times in a row.

6731
02:42:54,570 --> 02:42:58,170
So like, we must be close to plat for Ditto now.

6732
02:42:58,250 --> 02:42:58,610
Yeah.

6733
02:42:58,970 --> 02:42:59,450
Yes.

6734
02:43:01,110 --> 02:43:02,990
Yeah, those silvers never stood the chance.

6735
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:03,330
Yeah.

6736
02:43:05,670 --> 02:43:07,670
It's also... it's gold now, guys.

6737
02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:10,910
It's not just... it's also gold now.

6738
02:43:17,930 --> 02:43:18,490
It's gold now.

6739
02:43:18,650 --> 02:43:19,950
Oh my god, gold one.

6740
02:43:20,690 --> 02:43:21,530
Gold one.

6741
02:43:21,570 --> 02:43:22,450
Yeah, it's really gold one.

6742
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:25,190
Like, plat is already like master players and...

6743
02:43:25,190 --> 02:43:25,710
Yeah.

6744
02:43:26,130 --> 02:43:27,590
And there's master right now.

6745
02:43:28,630 --> 02:43:31,170
We literally got... we're getting it in like...

6746
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:32,910
Yeah, there's masters right now.

6747
02:43:33,150 --> 02:43:34,530
It's not like master?

6748
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:39,170
No, plat is masters right now because it just... the rank just started.

6749
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:40,190
Yeah.

6750
02:43:40,310 --> 02:43:40,990
Oh, I see.

6751
02:43:41,070 --> 02:43:41,390
I see.

6752
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:42,150
Mm-hmm.

6753
02:43:42,770 --> 02:43:43,930
Oh yeah, plat...

6754
02:43:43,930 --> 02:43:45,590
We're now fighting masters too.

6755
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:46,270
Yeah, yeah.

6756
02:43:46,610 --> 02:43:47,950
We're fighting masters now.

6757
02:43:48,510 --> 02:43:49,930
We were fighting masters.

6758
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:51,750
We've always been fighting masters, guys.

6759
02:43:52,210 --> 02:43:52,850
Oh, really?

6760
02:43:53,050 --> 02:43:53,490
Yeah.

6761
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:55,970
Actually, actually might have been, by the way.

6762
02:43:56,010 --> 02:43:56,930
Yeah, I think so.

6763
02:43:57,090 --> 02:43:57,730
I think they sure.

6764
02:43:58,330 --> 02:44:02,310
Some of them had... we had like a team with a decent aim at one point.

6765
02:44:02,450 --> 02:44:03,110
Oh, yeah.

6766
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:03,670
Yeah.

6767
02:44:04,050 --> 02:44:06,710
Like the Bangalore that sneaked up on Ditto as well.

6768
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:07,850
That one was like...

6769
02:44:07,850 --> 02:44:08,790
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6770
02:44:08,790 --> 02:44:09,110
Master?

6771
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:09,130
Master?

6772
02:44:09,130 --> 02:44:09,150
Yeah.

6773
02:44:09,150 --> 02:44:10,310
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6774
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:11,630
Yeah.

6775
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:12,030
All right.

6776
02:44:12,230 --> 02:44:13,650
Don't scare the grenades.

6777
02:44:14,950 --> 02:44:15,630
Let's go.

6778
02:44:16,310 --> 02:44:17,630
I'm gonna loot the back houses.

6779
02:44:18,210 --> 02:44:18,730
Okay.

6780
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:20,250
No team.

6781
02:44:20,630 --> 02:44:21,790
No team this time.

6782
02:44:22,070 --> 02:44:22,770
No team.

6783
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:25,570
Yeah, there's no one wanna contest us.

6784
02:44:26,310 --> 02:44:26,830
Yay.

6785
02:44:27,090 --> 02:44:27,870
They're scared.

6786
02:44:28,010 --> 02:44:28,910
They know we're here now.

6787
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:30,190
Yeah.

6788
02:44:30,490 --> 02:44:31,890
They know our names.

6789
02:44:33,090 --> 02:44:33,830
Let's see.

6790
02:44:35,210 --> 02:44:37,590
I'm gonna go grab...

6791
02:44:38,130 --> 02:44:38,890
Oh, yeah.

6792
02:44:38,890 --> 02:44:39,130
Oh, yeah.

6793
02:44:39,130 --> 02:44:40,390
Oh, my God.

6794
02:44:40,530 --> 02:44:42,410
I did a lot of damage.

6795
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:43,530
Yeah, you did.

6796
02:44:46,050 --> 02:44:48,210
You wanna try and get 20 kills, Ditto?

6797
02:44:48,990 --> 02:44:49,470
Yeah.

6798
02:44:49,730 --> 02:44:50,970
Ditto, you were so close.

6799
02:44:50,970 --> 02:44:51,250
Oh, yeah.

6800
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:52,130
You got 16.

6801
02:44:52,210 --> 02:44:53,370
Yeah, I got 16.

6802
02:44:53,410 --> 02:44:54,750
You could've got a 20 bomb.

6803
02:44:56,550 --> 02:44:58,330
We were so close to a 20 bomb.

6804
02:44:58,350 --> 02:44:58,770
Oh, my God.

6805
02:44:59,710 --> 02:45:00,650
It's almost there.

6806
02:45:00,750 --> 02:45:01,530
It was so fun.

6807
02:45:03,670 --> 02:45:04,390
Oh, my God.

6808
02:45:04,390 --> 02:45:05,750
Killing people is really fun.

6809
02:45:06,170 --> 02:45:07,290
In game, right?

6810
02:45:07,330 --> 02:45:07,970
In game?

6811
02:45:07,990 --> 02:45:08,590
Yeah, in game.

6812
02:45:08,690 --> 02:45:09,110
I'm so happy.

6813
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,630
In game.

6814
02:45:09,850 --> 02:45:10,950
In game.

6815
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:12,110
What are you talking?

6816
02:45:12,690 --> 02:45:13,270
Whoa, Ditto.

6817
02:45:14,250 --> 02:45:14,850
Whoa.

6818
02:45:15,870 --> 02:45:16,470
Apex.

6819
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:17,270
In Apex.

6820
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:18,790
In Apex.

6821
02:45:19,490 --> 02:45:20,550
Yeah, sure.

6822
02:45:20,650 --> 02:45:21,550
In Apex.

6823
02:45:21,570 --> 02:45:21,990
Yeah.

6824
02:45:22,730 --> 02:45:26,550
Yeah, because... except Apex, I can kill anyone.

6825
02:45:27,010 --> 02:45:28,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6826
02:45:28,970 --> 02:45:31,850
You can kill anyone and, like, you won't get in trouble.

6827
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:36,290
All right.

6828
02:45:36,310 --> 02:45:36,610
Ooh.

6829
02:45:37,850 --> 02:45:38,450
Nemesis.

6830
02:45:38,530 --> 02:45:39,090
Oh, yeah.

6831
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:40,590
I'm going to prowler.

6832
02:45:40,890 --> 02:45:42,250
I'm going to prowler.

6833
02:45:43,330 --> 02:45:45,970
Is car... is car good?

6834
02:45:46,250 --> 02:45:46,630
Car?

6835
02:45:46,750 --> 02:45:47,650
Car's always been good.

6836
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:47,750
Yeah.

6837
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:48,470
It's really good.

6838
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:49,330
Okay, okay.

6839
02:45:49,330 --> 02:45:50,170
It's the better R9.

6840
02:45:51,650 --> 02:45:53,690
R9 is really bad right now.

6841
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:54,690
Yeah, R9... yeah.

6842
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:56,530
Oh, yeah.

6843
02:45:56,690 --> 02:46:02,730
I need to... I need to remove my pred... my pred keychain on the R9.

6844
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:03,270
Why?

6845
02:46:03,270 --> 02:46:04,270
Because I can't see it.

6846
02:46:04,270 --> 02:46:06,710
Because I'm not... nobody's using it.

6847
02:46:06,710 --> 02:46:07,910
So, there's no point.

6848
02:46:08,230 --> 02:46:08,790
Okay.

6849
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:09,090
I'm going to prowler.

6850
02:46:09,090 --> 02:46:10,490
I need to remove it.

6851
02:46:10,570 --> 02:46:12,910
I'm using... I'm using R9 this time.

6852
02:46:13,030 --> 02:46:14,790
I need to put, like, another gun.

6853
02:46:15,410 --> 02:46:15,930
Oh, what?

6854
02:46:17,610 --> 02:46:18,230
Which gun?

6855
02:46:18,550 --> 02:46:19,270
I don't know.

6856
02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:20,030
Maybe Nemesis.

6857
02:46:20,450 --> 02:46:21,750
Because I use the Nemesis a lot.

6858
02:46:21,750 --> 02:46:22,570
I think Nemesis is so nice.

6859
02:46:22,650 --> 02:46:22,850
Yeah.

6860
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:24,230
Nemesis has always been really nice.

6861
02:46:24,270 --> 02:46:25,150
But Havoc is better.

6862
02:46:25,150 --> 02:46:25,490
Oh, yeah.

6863
02:46:25,610 --> 02:46:26,450
Nemesis is, like, good.

6864
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:27,330
I'm going to grab the Havoc, actually.

6865
02:46:27,690 --> 02:46:28,870
More on Havoc, Nemesis.

6866
02:46:30,210 --> 02:46:31,010
Havoc, Nemesis.

6867
02:46:31,190 --> 02:46:32,310
Yeah, that's a lot of energy.

6868
02:46:34,270 --> 02:46:35,650
R9 is, like, good, too.

6869
02:46:37,330 --> 02:46:38,390
Oh, thank you.

6870
02:46:38,430 --> 02:46:38,810
R9 is good.

6871
02:46:38,930 --> 02:46:39,070
R9 is good.

6872
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:41,470
L-Star is alright for me.

6873
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:44,510
I prefer Havoc if I see Havoc instead.

6874
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:45,950
L-Star is nice.

6875
02:46:46,390 --> 02:46:50,610
L-Star is... but, I don't know, like, far, L-Star is a bit shaky.

6876
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:52,630
Yeah, that's true.

6877
02:46:52,890 --> 02:46:53,430
That's true.

6878
02:46:53,670 --> 02:46:54,130
Oh, yeah.

6879
02:46:54,550 --> 02:46:55,770
It's a pretty hard team.

6880
02:46:56,650 --> 02:47:01,390
I feel like they, like, removed the spawn rate for R9, too, because it's dog shit now.

6881
02:47:02,530 --> 02:47:03,230
So, wait.

6882
02:47:03,330 --> 02:47:04,590
I haven't found a...

6883
02:47:04,590 --> 02:47:07,850
I only found one R9 the entire time we were playing.

6884
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:08,830
Oh, yeah.

6885
02:47:10,690 --> 02:47:11,050
Oh, yeah.

6886
02:47:11,050 --> 02:47:12,050
There's no one used there.

6887
02:47:13,690 --> 02:47:14,650
Wait, there's actually...

6888
02:47:14,650 --> 02:47:16,650
There might be somebody there, by the way.

6889
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:17,270
Oh, yeah.

6890
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:18,750
There's, like, a disruptor here, too, by the way.

6891
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:19,230
Yeah.

6892
02:47:19,470 --> 02:47:20,470
Yeah, I think.

6893
02:47:20,950 --> 02:47:21,830
I'm gonna go look.

6894
02:47:21,870 --> 02:47:22,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6895
02:47:22,710 --> 02:47:23,070
Wait.

6896
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:23,170
Wait.

6897
02:47:23,170 --> 02:47:24,370
I have to go home and wait here.

6898
02:47:24,910 --> 02:47:25,270
Wait.

6899
02:47:25,410 --> 02:47:26,650
I'm gonna EMP them.

6900
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:27,170
Are they close?

6901
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:28,110
Yeah, pretty close.

6902
02:47:28,190 --> 02:47:28,710
On my ping.

6903
02:47:28,870 --> 02:47:29,390
It's coming.

6904
02:47:29,650 --> 02:47:30,010
Here.

6905
02:47:30,250 --> 02:47:31,750
One guy on...

6906
02:47:33,250 --> 02:47:33,970
Maybe they're...

6907
02:47:33,970 --> 02:47:34,870
Coming to you.

6908
02:47:35,570 --> 02:47:35,930
Okay.

6909
02:47:36,370 --> 02:47:37,050
I'm heading over.

6910
02:47:37,170 --> 02:47:37,510
I'm heading over.

6911
02:47:38,570 --> 02:47:40,190
Can you get this guy?

6912
02:47:40,930 --> 02:47:41,810
He's fresh.

6913
02:47:43,790 --> 02:47:44,710
I'm pushing.

6914
02:47:45,930 --> 02:47:48,210
He's too far for me.

6915
02:47:48,750 --> 02:47:50,530
No, he was too far.

6916
02:47:53,570 --> 02:47:54,990
She's running so far.

6917
02:47:55,810 --> 02:47:56,510
He's scared.

6918
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:58,130
Oh my god.

6919
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:00,190
They used the knife.

6920
02:48:00,810 --> 02:48:01,830
Where are they?

6921
02:48:02,790 --> 02:48:03,770
On top.

6922
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:04,990
I see them.

6923
02:48:05,050 --> 02:48:07,310
Oh my god, they're already there?

6924
02:48:08,890 --> 02:48:09,950
They're so far.

6925
02:48:10,550 --> 02:48:12,730
I'm gonna bring a package here.

6926
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:15,050
I'm gonna loot.

6927
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:17,530
Now they know we're here.

6928
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:18,750
They don't know you're here.

6929
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:21,030
Because I'm looting here.

6930
02:48:22,630 --> 02:48:23,710
One is running.

6931
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:25,470
Where's the other team?

6932
02:48:26,250 --> 02:48:27,630
I'll get this guy for you.

6933
02:48:28,450 --> 02:48:29,530
I'll get this guy for you.

6934
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:30,630
He's right here.

6935
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:33,410
I'm running.

6936
02:48:34,730 --> 02:48:36,190
I'm running so fast.

6937
02:48:37,290 --> 02:48:38,690
Dido, you keep running too.

6938
02:48:39,950 --> 02:48:40,650
Oh my god.

6939
02:48:40,710 --> 02:48:41,190
Dido.

6940
02:48:41,790 --> 02:48:42,930
He's okay, I'm good.

6941
02:48:43,690 --> 02:48:44,970
Doki, careful, there's three.

6942
02:48:45,250 --> 02:48:46,630
I'm here.

6943
02:48:47,650 --> 02:48:49,270
I got shot by the longbow.

6944
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:50,050
I'm waiting.

6945
02:48:51,070 --> 02:48:52,350
Should I go up now?

6946
02:48:53,010 --> 02:48:55,390
I think they're running.

6947
02:48:55,710 --> 02:48:56,250
I think they ran.

6948
02:48:56,450 --> 02:48:57,030
No, they're gone.

6949
02:48:58,050 --> 02:48:58,990
They're all gone.

6950
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:02,970
I have an evac tower.

6951
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:03,630
Okay.

6952
02:49:04,310 --> 02:49:05,350
I'll be here.

6953
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:06,590
While you guys jump.

6954
02:49:06,730 --> 02:49:09,370
I don't know where they're going.

6955
02:49:09,470 --> 02:49:10,390
I don't know where they went either.

6956
02:49:10,990 --> 02:49:11,950
They're here.

6957
02:49:12,250 --> 02:49:14,330
They snipe you there.

6958
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:16,870
I don't know, I got sniped.

6959
02:49:16,930 --> 02:49:17,410
Right here.

6960
02:49:19,690 --> 02:49:21,150
All the way over there.

6961
02:49:21,490 --> 02:49:22,390
Are they rotating?

6962
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:23,590
Why?

6963
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:28,130
Over there.

6964
02:49:28,930 --> 02:49:29,610
Right in front of me.

6965
02:49:29,610 --> 02:49:30,070
Right in front of me.

6966
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:35,600
Be careful.

6967
02:49:35,800 --> 02:49:36,900
Wait, this isn't our team.

6968
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:37,900
They take the zip line.

6969
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:39,200
What?

6970
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:42,640
How do you have purple armor?

6971
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:43,420
What the fuck?

6972
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:46,840
Maybe they take only...

6973
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:49,800
Oh, that guy is really...

6974
02:49:49,800 --> 02:49:51,200
Do you want to jump on him?

6975
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,160
Fuck you.

6976
02:49:53,320 --> 02:49:55,240
Dido is rushing in.

6977
02:49:55,860 --> 02:49:57,660
That's a Rampart team!

6978
02:49:58,140 --> 02:49:58,540
Careful!

6979
02:49:58,540 --> 02:49:59,740
Careful, Dido!

6980
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:00,800
I'll be here.

6981
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:03,520
I can't look yet.

6982
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:04,780
I'm gonna shot a button.

6983
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:05,600
Oh my god!

6984
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:09,140
I couldn't hear.

6985
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:10,180
Lampart is low.

6986
02:50:11,440 --> 02:50:13,720
Wait, there's like three people on my face.

6987
02:50:13,780 --> 02:50:15,340
That's why I was like, that's a Rampart team!

6988
02:50:16,220 --> 02:50:17,020
That's another team.

6989
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:20,440
This guy is dog shit.

6990
02:50:21,380 --> 02:50:22,280
What the fuck?

6991
02:50:22,340 --> 02:50:22,940
Who threw that?

6992
02:50:23,240 --> 02:50:23,900
Wait, he's low?

6993
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:24,300
Doki?

6994
02:50:24,500 --> 02:50:25,100
No, I can't.

6995
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:26,920
I'm getting long mode.

6996
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:29,840
Wait, can you pick her up?

6997
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:30,400
I can rez her.

6998
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:30,700
Oh!

6999
02:50:33,020 --> 02:50:33,940
Nice one!

7000
02:50:34,860 --> 02:50:35,540
Oh my god!

7001
02:50:35,620 --> 02:50:37,240
I couldn't hear the Rampart.

7002
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:40,140
Guys, I can't do anything about it.

7003
02:50:40,160 --> 02:50:40,360
I'm sorry.

7004
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:41,560
You can go.

7005
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:44,660
I'm gonna craft you.

7006
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:47,280
Oh my god!

7007
02:50:47,660 --> 02:50:48,440
You're rezzing.

7008
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:49,800
No!

7009
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:52,280
It's okay.

7010
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:53,220
We're gonna craft.

7011
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:56,540
I told you that Rampart team!

7012
02:50:56,560 --> 02:50:57,280
They caught me!

7013
02:50:58,540 --> 02:50:59,980
I can hear the Rampart team!

7014
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:01,680
I felt it!

7015
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:06,020
That long mode guy was so bad though.

7016
02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:07,680
He missed like 100 shots on me.

7017
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,520
And then he hit me the moment you need me to peek.

7018
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:13,500
Okay.

7019
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:14,400
Oh my god.

7020
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:16,160
The only crafter is like all the way back here.

7021
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:17,760
Wait, there's a Loba.

7022
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:19,100
Wait.

7023
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:21,760
Who's Loba ult is that?

7024
02:51:22,800 --> 02:51:23,760
Wait, wait!

7025
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:30,660
I want to know if Plat player can team up with a Silver player.

7026
02:51:30,980 --> 02:51:31,320
No.

7027
02:51:32,180 --> 02:51:33,280
Only gold?

7028
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:34,900
I don't remember.

7029
02:51:35,060 --> 02:51:36,040
Maybe Diamond you can.

7030
02:51:36,480 --> 02:51:37,260
We'll see.

7031
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:38,620
When you get Plat we'll see.

7032
02:51:39,380 --> 02:51:39,980
Okay.

7033
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:41,820
I'm almost gold too anyway.

7034
02:51:42,100 --> 02:51:43,860
Anyone knows?

7035
02:51:43,860 --> 02:51:44,700
You can!

7036
02:51:45,240 --> 02:51:45,540
Okay.

7037
02:51:49,300 --> 02:51:50,600
It's three rank difference.

7038
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:51,560
So you can.

7039
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:52,860
Okay.

7040
02:51:52,860 --> 02:51:53,160
Okay.

7041
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:55,120
Then totally fine.

7042
02:51:57,460 --> 02:52:00,160
I just want to know where the fuck that Loba ult came from.

7043
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:00,520
Like who?

7044
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:03,800
Where did that team go?

7045
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:07,100
Oh my god.

7046
02:52:07,160 --> 02:52:08,320
Where did that team come from?

7047
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:09,820
Alright.

7048
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:10,780
It's my turn.

7049
02:52:11,100 --> 02:52:12,200
To be a hero.

7050
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:12,940
Yay!

7051
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:15,060
It would be funny if I crafted the wrong thing.

7052
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:17,580
Shield battery.

7053
02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:20,380
I was like looking at it.

7054
02:52:20,420 --> 02:52:21,640
It's like reflex, you know?

7055
02:52:22,860 --> 02:52:23,080
Yeah.

7056
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:25,660
Thank you, Doki.

7057
02:52:26,140 --> 02:52:26,660
Yay!

7058
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:28,400
We're all alive.

7059
02:52:28,480 --> 02:52:29,000
Thank you.

7060
02:52:29,160 --> 02:52:30,580
This is your first...

7061
02:52:30,580 --> 02:52:33,260
Your first...

7062
02:52:33,260 --> 02:52:34,140
Wait, Doki!

7063
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:34,900
There's a team!

7064
02:52:35,220 --> 02:52:35,860
Wait, wait, wait.

7065
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:37,660
Which one?

7066
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:38,880
Right here!

7067
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:41,620
I'm jumping right now.

7068
02:52:41,660 --> 02:52:42,100
That's me.

7069
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:43,540
Oh my god.

7070
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:44,580
Wait, what?

7071
02:52:44,680 --> 02:52:46,800
There's somebody behind us!

7072
02:52:48,520 --> 02:52:49,420
I'm backing up.

7073
02:52:50,500 --> 02:52:51,700
I'm gonna be there.

7074
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:54,400
I didn't lie.

7075
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:55,700
We should go back to...

7076
02:52:56,480 --> 02:52:56,920
Outlook?

7077
02:52:57,080 --> 02:52:57,220
No?

7078
02:52:57,580 --> 02:52:58,160
It's really far.

7079
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:00,960
This is the closest risk.

7080
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:02,020
Wait, they're pushing!

7081
02:53:03,900 --> 02:53:04,480
Are they?

7082
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:06,380
I saw them run off.

7083
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:07,700
I don't know where they're pushing though.

7084
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:08,000
I think he ran.

7085
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:09,580
I think he ran.

7086
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:13,660
They didn't really push.

7087
02:53:13,780 --> 02:53:14,900
What the fuck are they doing?

7088
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:17,180
They're a bit scared.

7089
02:53:17,400 --> 02:53:18,040
I'm not sure why.

7090
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:20,200
Wait, another team is fighting.

7091
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:21,480
Oh, wait.

7092
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:23,260
What?

7093
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:25,520
Maybe here.

7094
02:53:26,860 --> 02:53:28,580
Okay, I need a little bit of ammo.

7095
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:29,620
What the fuck?

7096
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:33,000
They're throwing everything at me.

7097
02:53:33,200 --> 02:53:33,940
What happened?

7098
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,680
What are they doing?

7099
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:37,120
Another team here.

7100
02:53:38,060 --> 02:53:41,200
I'm going to you guys now.

7101
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:42,420
I'm like, where are they?

7102
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,800
We have to go inside the ring.

7103
02:53:47,500 --> 02:53:48,600
We can go in the car.

7104
02:53:48,940 --> 02:53:50,540
My chat is like the 1%.

7105
02:53:52,500 --> 02:53:55,560
You only killed 99% of the bacteria.

7106
02:54:00,860 --> 02:54:01,980
I'm going to go up here.

7107
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:04,360
Wait, they're fighting.

7108
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:06,520
They don't know.

7109
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:08,500
You flank them.

7110
02:54:08,540 --> 02:54:10,160
Hiro and I are going to show up here.

7111
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:10,760
Here.

7112
02:54:13,660 --> 02:54:14,500
What are they doing?

7113
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:15,700
I don't know.

7114
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:17,540
I got hit though.

7115
02:54:18,060 --> 02:54:19,060
They hit you?

7116
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:22,900
I'm trying to get them back.

7117
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:23,320
Go, Ditto.

7118
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:25,280
Where are they?

7119
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:26,180
Oh my god.

7120
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:26,740
He's low.

7121
02:54:26,980 --> 02:54:27,780
One guy low.

7122
02:54:28,220 --> 02:54:28,860
We're looking.

7123
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,420
I hit the purple armor too.

7124
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:33,420
Oh my god.

7125
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:34,340
I got armstacked.

7126
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:35,160
I got armstacked.

7127
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:37,060
Oh my god.

7128
02:54:37,080 --> 02:54:37,960
I got stuck.

7129
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:39,620
I broke one, Doki.

7130
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:40,740
I can't see.

7131
02:54:40,920 --> 02:54:41,540
It's so hard to see.

7132
02:54:41,540 --> 02:54:42,120
Bangalore is low.

7133
02:54:44,600 --> 02:54:46,260
My nade is hitting.

7134
02:54:46,540 --> 02:54:46,900
Flash.

7135
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:49,680
They're in my thermite.

7136
02:54:50,640 --> 02:54:51,680
Oh, he killed me.

7137
02:54:53,360 --> 02:54:53,840
I'm in.

7138
02:54:53,940 --> 02:54:54,160
I'm hitting.

7139
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:55,100
Nice.

7140
02:54:55,460 --> 02:54:56,080
I'm pushing up.

7141
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:57,080
Nice.

7142
02:54:57,080 --> 02:54:57,320
Nice.

7143
02:54:58,720 --> 02:54:59,420
Nice one.

7144
02:55:00,020 --> 02:55:00,840
He's so low.

7145
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:01,320
Bangalore.

7146
02:55:03,100 --> 02:55:04,200
Doki, you can't do it.

7147
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:05,340
I'm pushing.

7148
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:08,300
Oh my god.

7149
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:08,880
He's so low.

7150
02:55:09,740 --> 02:55:10,360
I'm down.

7151
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:11,940
Yeah, he might come to you.

7152
02:55:11,980 --> 02:55:13,120
Just try and heal.

7153
02:55:13,980 --> 02:55:14,800
I don't know where.

7154
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:17,400
Where did he go?

7155
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:18,160
Nice one.

7156
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:19,000
Down.

7157
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:21,580
Oh, he's over there.

7158
02:55:21,780 --> 02:55:22,460
Yeah, that's fine.

7159
02:55:22,500 --> 02:55:22,740
That's fine.

7160
02:55:22,740 --> 02:55:23,440
His team is far.

7161
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:25,300
Refresh your armor.

7162
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:27,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7163
02:55:27,140 --> 02:55:27,820
I'll cover you.

7164
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:30,300
I think that Bangalore is on the way.

7165
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,500
No, he was outside.

7166
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:34,560
He was outside the door.

7167
02:55:35,080 --> 02:55:36,440
I don't have ammo.

7168
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:38,120
Is there any energy?

7169
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:39,220
Yeah, there's energy in here.

7170
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:42,580
There's a turbo charger in here.

7171
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:43,180
Oh, I need that.

7172
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:43,800
I'm gonna close this door.

7173
02:55:43,800 --> 02:55:44,460
Oh, we gotta leave.

7174
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:45,440
Yeah, we gotta leave.

7175
02:55:45,960 --> 02:55:46,680
Holy shit.

7176
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:47,480
Yeah.

7177
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:50,720
Maybe you can... you can...

7178
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:51,260
You can... you can...

7179
02:55:51,260 --> 02:55:52,060
You can... you can...

7180
02:55:52,060 --> 02:55:52,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7181
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:56,140
Oh, yeah.

7182
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:56,580
We're in free...

7183
02:55:56,580 --> 02:55:58,900
Yeah, but... yeah.

7184
02:55:58,920 --> 02:55:59,400
We have to run.

7185
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:00,180
It's okay.

7186
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:02,140
Wait!

7187
02:56:02,140 --> 02:56:02,580
Wait!

7188
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:04,100
Are they racing?

7189
02:56:04,460 --> 02:56:06,100
Are they racing behind you?

7190
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:06,720
Yeah.

7191
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:08,040
No, no.

7192
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:08,520
That's another team.

7193
02:56:08,580 --> 02:56:09,000
That's another team.

7194
02:56:09,660 --> 02:56:10,540
Blue armor.

7195
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:11,060
Blue armor.

7196
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:11,620
Right here.

7197
02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:12,280
Just one person.

7198
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:13,140
Flash, flash, flash.

7199
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:13,720
Flash, flash, flash.

7200
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:14,860
I don't have ammo.

7201
02:56:15,060 --> 02:56:16,120
I don't have ammo.

7202
02:56:16,380 --> 02:56:16,860
Just run.

7203
02:56:17,020 --> 02:56:17,300
Run.

7204
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:18,380
Do you need energy?

7205
02:56:20,060 --> 02:56:21,440
What are you doing?

7206
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:21,980
What are you doing?

7207
02:56:22,900 --> 02:56:23,340
Here.

7208
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:25,120
I need any energy.

7209
02:56:26,300 --> 02:56:26,740
Here.

7210
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:29,260
Okay.

7211
02:56:29,260 --> 02:56:29,920
Nice, guys.

7212
02:56:30,240 --> 02:56:31,120
Wait, do you have a Q?

7213
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:32,440
I do.

7214
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:33,120
I do here.

7215
02:56:33,620 --> 02:56:35,060
I didn't know you had no meds.

7216
02:56:35,100 --> 02:56:36,240
I didn't know you were that poor.

7217
02:56:40,260 --> 02:56:41,220
I'll EMP them.

7218
02:56:43,140 --> 02:56:43,420
I don't have ammo.

7219
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:43,680
I don't have any.

7220
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:44,600
Just craft ammo.

7221
02:56:44,780 --> 02:56:45,500
I'm crafting ammo, too.

7222
02:56:45,980 --> 02:56:47,520
I'm grabbing ammo, as well.

7223
02:56:47,800 --> 02:56:48,500
Blow us?

7224
02:56:51,160 --> 02:56:52,020
They're below here.

7225
02:56:52,220 --> 02:56:52,660
I'm pretty sure.

7226
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:55,260
Okay, we gotta pray that this gives us...

7227
02:56:55,800 --> 02:56:57,640
Oh, we gotta go from below.

7228
02:56:57,640 --> 02:56:57,940
Yeah, yeah.

7229
02:56:57,940 --> 02:57:00,080
We gotta pray that this gives us mobile res beacon.

7230
02:57:00,380 --> 02:57:01,160
Oh, wait, wait.

7231
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:01,720
I'm leaving.

7232
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:02,140
I'm leaving.

7233
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:02,800
Wait, you're leaving?

7234
02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:05,560
I'm doing it for you.

7235
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:06,400
Remember what I did.

7236
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:07,000
Nothing.

7237
02:57:07,860 --> 02:57:08,980
No mobile res beacon.

7238
02:57:08,980 --> 02:57:10,840
I'm gonna go to the beacon.

7239
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:12,340
I'm gonna res her at the beacon.

7240
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:13,740
Oh, there's a beacon?

7241
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:14,520
Oh, there's here.

7242
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:15,740
Yeah, there's beacon.

7243
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:17,440
I'm gonna do it now.

7244
02:57:17,580 --> 02:57:18,060
I'm gonna do it now.

7245
02:57:18,260 --> 02:57:19,080
Oh my god.

7246
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:23,300
Oh no.

7247
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:23,620
Oh crap.

7248
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:25,080
It's okay.

7249
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:25,980
It's okay.

7250
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:26,860
Don't worry.

7251
02:57:27,400 --> 02:57:28,140
No problem.

7252
02:57:28,320 --> 02:57:28,680
No problem.

7253
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:29,460
I'm worrying.

7254
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:30,060
I'm worrying.

7255
02:57:30,220 --> 02:57:30,720
Oh, I'm worrying.

7256
02:57:36,900 --> 02:57:37,420
It's okay.

7257
02:57:37,540 --> 02:57:37,960
It's okay.

7258
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:38,480
It's okay.

7259
02:57:38,480 --> 02:57:41,460
I think they're gonna push to you guys.

7260
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:42,220
No, they are.

7261
02:57:42,340 --> 02:57:42,600
They are.

7262
02:57:43,240 --> 02:57:44,780
Oh, they push here.

7263
02:57:46,460 --> 02:57:46,900
Loba.

7264
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:47,760
Loba's almost here.

7265
02:57:52,350 --> 02:57:52,790
Loba's almost here.

7266
02:57:52,870 --> 02:57:54,830
Oh, I'm trying my best to help.

7267
02:57:57,990 --> 02:57:59,930
Oh my god.

7268
02:58:00,730 --> 02:58:02,510
I was running all around.

7269
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:05,030
Wait, you can res me, I think.

7270
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:06,050
No, no, no.

7271
02:58:06,090 --> 02:58:06,410
I cannot.

7272
02:58:06,730 --> 02:58:07,170
No.

7273
02:58:07,350 --> 02:58:08,070
No, they're gone.

7274
02:58:08,210 --> 02:58:08,690
They're gone?

7275
02:58:10,070 --> 02:58:11,150
They're actually gone?

7276
02:58:11,550 --> 02:58:12,830
They weren't here.

7277
02:58:13,030 --> 02:58:13,370
They weren't here.

7278
02:58:14,850 --> 02:58:15,890
There's another team.

7279
02:58:16,550 --> 02:58:17,290
Oh, nice.

7280
02:58:18,330 --> 02:58:19,670
Wait, let me get behind that.

7281
02:58:19,790 --> 02:58:21,190
Oh my god.

7282
02:58:21,270 --> 02:58:22,250
Oh my god.

7283
02:58:24,910 --> 02:58:25,390
Wait.

7284
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:26,790
See you, cute.

7285
02:58:27,310 --> 02:58:27,790
Nice.

7286
02:58:31,190 --> 02:58:31,670
Nice.

7287
02:58:31,970 --> 02:58:33,210
Maybe you can get his tie.

7288
02:58:34,450 --> 02:58:35,330
I'm trying.

7289
02:58:35,390 --> 02:58:38,010
I'm trying so hard to live.

7290
02:58:38,690 --> 02:58:39,430
Oh, Hiro.

7291
02:58:39,550 --> 02:58:40,430
Goodbye, Hiro.

7292
02:58:40,730 --> 02:58:42,010
On top, on top, on top.

7293
02:58:42,210 --> 02:58:43,410
Be careful on top.

7294
02:58:45,010 --> 02:58:45,890
Holy shit.

7295
02:58:45,890 --> 02:58:46,410
Wait, what?

7296
02:58:46,850 --> 02:58:48,750
Wait, what did you just say?

7297
02:58:48,790 --> 02:58:50,370
Wait, I EMP'd all of them.

7298
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:52,270
Oh, Hiro, there is no...

7299
02:58:52,270 --> 02:58:53,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7300
02:58:54,270 --> 02:58:55,830
You're getting literally crass.

7301
02:58:57,310 --> 02:58:58,530
What do you mean?

7302
02:58:59,010 --> 02:59:00,450
I'm not getting there.

7303
02:59:00,690 --> 02:59:02,350
I am not getting there.

7304
02:59:04,330 --> 02:59:05,310
You got this.

7305
02:59:07,810 --> 02:59:08,810
Holy shit.

7306
02:59:08,930 --> 02:59:11,250
The moment they walk up this, I'm dead.

7307
02:59:12,710 --> 02:59:13,550
It's the cape.

7308
02:59:14,610 --> 02:59:15,390
It's the cape.

7309
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:17,710
I hear the fucking rampart.

7310
02:59:17,710 --> 02:59:18,330
They ain't done.

7311
02:59:18,550 --> 02:59:19,090
They ain't done.

7312
02:59:19,650 --> 02:59:20,530
They don't know?

7313
02:59:20,650 --> 02:59:21,210
They don't know?

7314
02:59:21,290 --> 02:59:21,730
Is that it?

7315
02:59:21,830 --> 02:59:22,090
Yeah.

7316
02:59:22,810 --> 02:59:23,910
Yeah, they don't.

7317
02:59:26,450 --> 02:59:27,290
They're lazy.

7318
02:59:27,790 --> 02:59:29,310
Kira, Kira, Kira.

7319
02:59:29,930 --> 02:59:31,810
If I shoot, I die.

7320
02:59:33,010 --> 02:59:34,330
Oh my god.

7321
02:59:34,450 --> 02:59:34,590
Oh my god.

7322
02:59:35,310 --> 02:59:36,030
They shoot?

7323
02:59:39,130 --> 02:59:40,110
Oh my god.

7324
02:59:40,150 --> 02:59:42,430
Holy shit.

7325
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:44,310
Holy shit.

7326
02:59:44,590 --> 02:59:46,030
Wait, maybe you should leave.

7327
02:59:46,690 --> 02:59:47,610
No, I can't.

7328
02:59:47,630 --> 02:59:48,570
There's people to my left.

7329
02:59:49,910 --> 02:59:51,370
There's a rampart right here.

7330
02:59:52,510 --> 02:59:53,430
Oh my god.

7331
02:59:53,510 --> 02:59:53,670
Please.

7332
02:59:55,570 --> 02:59:56,410
Oh my god.

7333
02:59:58,130 --> 02:59:58,990
It's so hard.

7334
02:59:59,270 --> 03:00:00,210
Oh wait, they're re-deploying.

7335
03:00:00,670 --> 03:00:02,790
Yeah, they have to fly.

7336
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:03,870
They have to, they're scared.

7337
03:00:05,310 --> 03:00:05,750
Leave you alone.

7338
03:00:06,170 --> 03:00:06,950
Leave me alone.

7339
03:00:07,730 --> 03:00:08,730
Only one?

7340
03:00:10,150 --> 03:00:10,870
Two.

7341
03:00:11,070 --> 03:00:11,870
They're slow.

7342
03:00:12,570 --> 03:00:18,310
You can go third them later, I think.

7343
03:00:19,010 --> 03:00:20,430
You can go third them later, I think.

7344
03:00:20,430 --> 03:00:22,350
The last one is...

7345
03:00:22,350 --> 03:00:24,910
The last one, I...

7346
03:00:24,910 --> 03:00:27,410
I think there's no cover.

7347
03:00:27,610 --> 03:00:28,010
What the fuck.

7348
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:29,250
What the fuck.

7349
03:00:31,110 --> 03:00:31,830
What?

7350
03:00:36,060 --> 03:00:37,360
Two minutes left.

7351
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,140
Anyone inside?

7352
03:00:41,380 --> 03:00:42,900
Is there anyone inside?

7353
03:00:43,160 --> 03:00:43,380
No?

7354
03:00:43,700 --> 03:00:45,580
Can you go inside?

7355
03:00:46,220 --> 03:00:48,960
This is so...

7356
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:50,000
This is so...

7357
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,500
Oh my god.

7358
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:54,680
Bro, stop!

7359
03:00:57,230 --> 03:00:57,510
No!

7360
03:00:58,610 --> 03:00:59,850
You're crazy!

7361
03:01:00,430 --> 03:01:01,810
You're really insane!

7362
03:01:01,810 --> 03:01:03,230
They're gonna lose.

7363
03:01:03,690 --> 03:01:05,710
They die?

7364
03:01:05,930 --> 03:01:06,950
They die?

7365
03:01:07,170 --> 03:01:07,390
No?

7366
03:01:08,150 --> 03:01:08,990
They're gone.

7367
03:01:09,110 --> 03:01:09,570
They're gone.

7368
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:10,490
What?

7369
03:01:12,650 --> 03:01:13,210
How?

7370
03:01:13,570 --> 03:01:15,450
How did they let them do that?

7371
03:01:16,630 --> 03:01:18,010
I don't know.

7372
03:01:18,710 --> 03:01:20,150
It's so fucked up.

7373
03:01:20,350 --> 03:01:22,370
It's cause they're all the way up there.

7374
03:01:22,490 --> 03:01:22,950
What the fuck?

7375
03:01:23,290 --> 03:01:24,730
They're crazy.

7376
03:01:27,990 --> 03:01:29,710
They didn't shoot each other.

7377
03:01:29,990 --> 03:01:30,490
Why?

7378
03:01:30,490 --> 03:01:32,090
Was it a bloodhound?

7379
03:01:32,690 --> 03:01:35,310
That was the worst thing for us.

7380
03:01:35,310 --> 03:01:37,090
Wait, this team is like dead though.

7381
03:01:38,630 --> 03:01:39,270
No!

7382
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:40,910
I streamed.

7383
03:01:40,910 --> 03:01:43,310
They eliminated us.

7384
03:01:44,930 --> 03:01:46,930
I can't believe it.

7385
03:01:48,270 --> 03:01:48,890
I can't believe it.

7386
03:01:48,890 --> 03:01:49,630
It's cause Ditto died.

7387
03:01:49,850 --> 03:01:50,510
We didn't have Ditto.

7388
03:01:51,230 --> 03:01:52,590
Ditto died too early.

7389
03:01:53,470 --> 03:01:54,570
Oh my god.

7390
03:01:55,090 --> 03:01:56,370
Ditto, you were super...

7391
03:01:56,370 --> 03:01:57,450
IGL died.

7392
03:01:57,610 --> 03:01:58,350
What do we do?

7393
03:01:58,810 --> 03:02:02,270
What do we do when our IGL dies?

7394
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:06,170
Yeah, we just can't do anything without Ditto.

7395
03:02:08,630 --> 03:02:09,590
I'm back.

7396
03:02:09,790 --> 03:02:10,250
I'm back.

7397
03:02:12,050 --> 03:02:17,630
Yeah, I can't believe it.

7398
03:02:18,010 --> 03:02:20,930
They killed our strongest cootie.

7399
03:02:23,290 --> 03:02:24,930
You're almost plat though.

7400
03:02:25,830 --> 03:02:26,810
Oh really?

7401
03:02:27,130 --> 03:02:27,550
Yeah.

7402
03:02:28,250 --> 03:02:29,410
How do you know?

7403
03:02:32,270 --> 03:02:34,810
I just got to go one.

7404
03:02:35,010 --> 03:02:36,190
Maybe two champs.

7405
03:02:36,210 --> 03:02:37,810
Yeah, two wins ago.

7406
03:02:37,850 --> 03:02:38,950
So she should be close now.

7407
03:02:39,250 --> 03:02:40,530
We got top three.

7408
03:02:42,570 --> 03:02:45,970
Aren't you like just a few points away or something?

7409
03:02:46,150 --> 03:02:46,890
Yeah, you should be.

7410
03:02:47,750 --> 03:02:48,190
Okay.

7411
03:02:48,610 --> 03:02:49,930
We stop when...

7412
03:02:49,930 --> 03:02:51,410
We stop when...

7413
03:02:52,010 --> 03:02:55,010
Hero gets gold and Ditto gets plat.

7414
03:02:56,050 --> 03:02:56,490
Yeah.

7415
03:02:56,650 --> 03:02:58,030
Yeah, that's what we call it.

7416
03:03:01,320 --> 03:03:02,160
Oh my gosh.

7417
03:03:02,340 --> 03:03:03,940
Guys, how many wins have we got so far?

7418
03:03:04,020 --> 03:03:05,760
I feel like we won like every...

7419
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:06,860
almost every game.

7420
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:08,900
Like 80 games.

7421
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:11,000
Why there's a lot of teams here?

7422
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:13,320
Why?

7423
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:14,840
Oh, there's a lot of people.

7424
03:03:14,940 --> 03:03:16,740
Yeah, why they win that?

7425
03:03:16,940 --> 03:03:18,380
Wait, they're all going there.

7426
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:20,760
Holy shit.

7427
03:03:21,300 --> 03:03:23,080
That's not even where the good loot is.

7428
03:03:23,180 --> 03:03:23,740
That's the thing.

7429
03:03:24,600 --> 03:03:26,500
Wait, there's someone... one right here.

7430
03:03:26,860 --> 03:03:28,740
Okay, kill them first.

7431
03:03:29,660 --> 03:03:31,840
Oh, apparently we had like five wins.

7432
03:03:33,400 --> 03:03:34,000
Oh, really?

7433
03:03:34,160 --> 03:03:35,080
Yeah, that's pretty good.

7434
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:37,560
Oh, a lot.

7435
03:03:38,380 --> 03:03:39,360
Oh my gosh.

7436
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:40,340
Wait, where's the team?

7437
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:41,460
You said there's a team here?

7438
03:03:41,720 --> 03:03:42,340
Yeah, yeah.

7439
03:03:42,580 --> 03:03:43,200
Where is it?

7440
03:03:43,400 --> 03:03:45,140
They're in the middle of the area.

7441
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:45,940
Oh, the house?

7442
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:46,480
Yeah.

7443
03:03:50,060 --> 03:03:51,340
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

7444
03:03:52,060 --> 03:03:52,720
Let's kill them.

7445
03:03:53,540 --> 03:03:56,520
Last time I played with Appiah, it's so hard to get champion.

7446
03:03:56,520 --> 03:03:57,060
I know, right?

7447
03:03:57,540 --> 03:03:59,180
Yeah, you need all girl squad.

7448
03:03:59,180 --> 03:04:00,200
Wait, what?

7449
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:01,700
Where did they go?

7450
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:04,020
Where did they go?

7451
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:04,620
They're here?

7452
03:04:05,020 --> 03:04:06,640
They killed somebody.

7453
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:07,780
They killed...

7454
03:04:07,780 --> 03:04:09,220
Over here.

7455
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,840
I'm going to bottom.

7456
03:04:12,220 --> 03:04:13,000
Careful, careful.

7457
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:16,900
I got one.

7458
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:18,120
Tommy?

7459
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,000
Flash, flash, flash, you got him.

7460
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:23,220
Nice.

7461
03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:25,260
Oh my god, he has a PK!

7462
03:04:25,640 --> 03:04:28,340
He has a massive, massive, massive, massive PK.

7463
03:04:28,600 --> 03:04:28,920
I don't know.

7464
03:04:30,740 --> 03:04:32,000
Massive, massive, massive, massive.

7465
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:33,560
Right here, on the stairs, on the stairs, on the stairs.

7466
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:35,020
They're not resing, he's not resing yet.

7467
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:36,660
Second floor?

7468
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:39,120
Okay.

7469
03:04:39,400 --> 03:04:40,860
I can go, I can go.

7470
03:04:40,940 --> 03:04:41,900
He's resing, resing now, resing now.

7471
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:43,380
Oh, they're resing, they're resing.

7472
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:44,920
Oh, we're resing too.

7473
03:04:46,860 --> 03:04:49,340
I will go try to cross the door here.

7474
03:04:50,780 --> 03:04:52,380
We thirsted one though, we thirsted one.

7475
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:53,540
Maybe you can't touch me?

7476
03:04:55,280 --> 03:04:56,180
Be careful, be careful.

7477
03:04:56,460 --> 03:04:57,000
Flash, got him!

7478
03:04:57,280 --> 03:04:58,060
Nice, nice.

7479
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:02,120
Yeah, nice.

7480
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:02,880
Nice!

7481
03:05:03,100 --> 03:05:05,060
Yeah, girl squad, girl squad!

7482
03:05:05,060 --> 03:05:07,620
Yeah, we're resing, we're resing, we're resing.

7483
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:12,340
Okay, I need a heal and...

7484
03:05:12,340 --> 03:05:13,880
Oh no, my drone!

7485
03:05:15,860 --> 03:05:16,780
My drone!

7486
03:05:17,340 --> 03:05:17,640
Okay.

7487
03:05:18,880 --> 03:05:19,340
Alright.

7488
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:22,260
I'm healing myself, I don't have drone right now.

7489
03:05:22,460 --> 03:05:22,640
I have as.

7490
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:24,700
Okay.

7491
03:05:25,480 --> 03:05:26,600
Alright, let's see.

7492
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:31,320
I got two shots, I got two shots from Mastiff and I'm dead.

7493
03:05:31,320 --> 03:05:33,000
Yeah, that Mastiff fucked us up.

7494
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:34,000
That was scary.

7495
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,900
Yeah, I saw that, I was like, oh god, you guys both went down immediately.

7496
03:05:37,220 --> 03:05:39,940
Yeah, I like looked at him and I instantly died.

7497
03:05:40,100 --> 03:05:40,920
And I was like, okay.

7498
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:44,520
I'm just like, yeah, that sounds right.

7499
03:05:45,460 --> 03:05:46,320
Okay, I'm healing you.

7500
03:05:46,460 --> 03:05:47,360
I got Mastiff.

7501
03:05:47,720 --> 03:05:48,560
I'm ready too.

7502
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:49,460
Now it's your turn.

7503
03:05:52,220 --> 03:05:52,580
Alright.

7504
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:53,000
Let's go.

7505
03:05:54,520 --> 03:05:57,180
There should be a lot of teams in front of us here.

7506
03:05:57,260 --> 03:05:58,580
Yeah, I'm gonna scan them right now.

7507
03:05:58,580 --> 03:05:59,920
They're racing, they're racing, they're racing.

7508
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:00,320
Oh, okay.

7509
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:01,760
You should come here.

7510
03:06:01,940 --> 03:06:03,660
I have EMP.

7511
03:06:04,060 --> 03:06:04,460
Nice.

7512
03:06:05,080 --> 03:06:05,480
Wait,

7513
03:06:08,540 --> 03:06:09,540
that's a golden longbow!

7514
03:06:10,380 --> 03:06:11,100
Where is that?

7515
03:06:11,520 --> 03:06:12,140
Where is that?

7516
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:13,220
I need it.

7517
03:06:13,380 --> 03:06:14,920
I wanna run golden longbow.

7518
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:19,240
Oh, they destroyed it before you could do it.

7519
03:06:19,420 --> 03:06:19,880
Too bad.

7520
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:20,920
There's just one guy.

7521
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:22,220
Yeah, there's just one guy.

7522
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:23,480
I'm gonna cross for you.

7523
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:25,460
I'm almost there.

7524
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:27,200
I'm here.

7525
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:28,160
Where are they?

7526
03:06:30,360 --> 03:06:31,740
Why is armor in blue?

7527
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:34,820
Oh my god, I got killed.

7528
03:06:34,940 --> 03:06:35,700
You got crossed.

7529
03:06:35,900 --> 03:06:37,140
I see.

7530
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:40,240
I got so fast.

7531
03:06:40,750 --> 03:06:41,360
Okay, wait.

7532
03:06:41,920 --> 03:06:43,600
Where is Patiam?

7533
03:06:44,300 --> 03:06:45,740
I'm gonna get him.

7534
03:06:46,820 --> 03:06:48,400
They're chasing you.

7535
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:49,540
Wait, they're chasing me?

7536
03:06:50,500 --> 03:06:51,280
No, they know.

7537
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:53,600
They know I'm a lifeline.

7538
03:06:54,680 --> 03:06:56,000
They know I'm a lifeline.

7539
03:06:56,060 --> 03:06:58,420
They know I'm a lifeline.

7540
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:00,080
Grab her!

7541
03:07:00,400 --> 03:07:02,360
I'm gonna send them on a wild goose chase.

7542
03:07:05,360 --> 03:07:06,180
Did you get it?

7543
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:07,400
No!

7544
03:07:07,740 --> 03:07:09,360
I just crafted.

7545
03:07:10,280 --> 03:07:13,180
Okay, they're chasing me.

7546
03:07:13,940 --> 03:07:15,100
I just wanted to longbow.

7547
03:07:15,100 --> 03:07:18,280
There's two people on the death box.

7548
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:20,840
Okay, so the bloodhound is just chasing me.

7549
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:22,680
There's only one?

7550
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:25,000
You want to be one bloodhound?

7551
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:26,060
Wait, wait.

7552
03:07:26,420 --> 03:07:27,940
You can last me here.

7553
03:07:28,120 --> 03:07:29,480
There's a person that acclimatized.

7554
03:07:29,540 --> 03:07:30,200
You want me to rest you here?

7555
03:07:30,800 --> 03:07:31,560
No, wait.

7556
03:07:34,400 --> 03:07:35,100
Don't craft it!

7557
03:07:36,280 --> 03:07:37,440
No, you already crafted!

7558
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:39,660
I crafted it earlier.

7559
03:07:42,280 --> 03:07:42,840
It's okay.

7560
03:07:43,020 --> 03:07:43,140
It's okay.

7561
03:07:44,380 --> 03:07:45,640
You already crafted.

7562
03:07:47,360 --> 03:07:47,860
Don't worry.

7563
03:07:47,980 --> 03:07:49,040
I'll get your banner.

7564
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:49,620
I'll get it.

7565
03:07:50,040 --> 03:07:51,400
You get my banner.

7566
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:53,320
Oh my god.

7567
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:57,780
I saw the scab.

7568
03:07:57,800 --> 03:07:59,680
I didn't know they would get to me so fast.

7569
03:08:00,540 --> 03:08:02,800
They got to me so fast.

7570
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:03,540
Oh my god.

7571
03:08:04,100 --> 03:08:07,900
I really feel so sorry for you.

7572
03:08:08,120 --> 03:08:09,160
You think I can get it?

7573
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:10,140
I don't know.

7574
03:08:10,140 --> 03:08:11,520
I believe I can.

7575
03:08:12,380 --> 03:08:13,900
You think this is enough?

7576
03:08:14,060 --> 03:08:14,640
The distance?

7577
03:08:15,080 --> 03:08:18,540
If you couldn't, you can just carve at the camp.

7578
03:08:18,540 --> 03:08:18,680
Oh, you can.

7579
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:19,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7580
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:20,140
Let's see.

7581
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:21,320
Yeah.

7582
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:22,980
Let me try.

7583
03:08:23,300 --> 03:08:25,740
It's too far.

7584
03:08:26,300 --> 03:08:27,000
Can you?

7585
03:08:27,180 --> 03:08:28,240
It's a far distance.

7586
03:08:28,920 --> 03:08:29,960
Oh, 30.

7587
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:31,280
Is it?

7588
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:34,020
Oh, oh, oh!

7589
03:08:34,740 --> 03:08:35,420
Yeah!

7590
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:37,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7591
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:39,040
Yeah!

7592
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:42,160
Yeah, I can grab my loot.

7593
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:44,040
Nice.

7594
03:08:44,660 --> 03:08:48,680
Where are they?

7595
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:49,960
I have no idea.

7596
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:51,160
I'm a animal.

7597
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:52,280
I didn't know either.

7598
03:08:52,700 --> 03:08:53,920
I got fucked up.

7599
03:08:54,400 --> 03:08:55,680
Where did I die?

7600
03:08:56,660 --> 03:08:57,220
What?

7601
03:09:02,080 --> 03:09:03,200
They stayed?

7602
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:05,840
They actually...

7603
03:09:05,840 --> 03:09:07,380
They can't get another point from me.

7604
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:08,440
You can't respawn me.

7605
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:12,200
They stayed?

7606
03:09:13,580 --> 03:09:15,580
They actually stayed.

7607
03:09:16,360 --> 03:09:17,180
Oh my god.

7608
03:09:18,600 --> 03:09:19,680
They got me.

7609
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:20,700
They're gone.

7610
03:09:20,800 --> 03:09:21,000
They're gone.

7611
03:09:21,240 --> 03:09:21,920
Trust, trust.

7612
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:22,420
They're gone.

7613
03:09:23,140 --> 03:09:25,260
That's so fucked up.

7614
03:09:26,840 --> 03:09:28,560
That's so fucked up.

7615
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:30,660
Oh my god, Hiro.

7616
03:09:30,720 --> 03:09:31,720
They're gonna come for you.

7617
03:09:31,800 --> 03:09:31,820
Oh my god.

7618
03:09:32,780 --> 03:09:33,520
I'm running!

7619
03:09:34,760 --> 03:09:36,640
Maybe you can raise us.

7620
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:37,780
Right here?

7621
03:09:38,720 --> 03:09:39,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7622
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:44,820
You're gonna get shot off the zip.

7623
03:09:44,860 --> 03:09:46,120
You're gonna get shot off the zip.

7624
03:09:46,520 --> 03:09:47,420
Trust me.

7625
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:49,440
You're gonna get shot off.

7626
03:09:49,780 --> 03:09:51,580
There's two squads here.

7627
03:09:52,040 --> 03:09:52,600
Okay.

7628
03:09:52,740 --> 03:09:53,220
It's okay.

7629
03:09:53,800 --> 03:09:54,480
It's okay.

7630
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:55,640
You just gotta run to us.

7631
03:09:55,680 --> 03:09:56,600
Because we...

7632
03:09:59,940 --> 03:10:01,220
Let me see.

7633
03:10:01,460 --> 03:10:01,760
Let me see.

7634
03:10:01,840 --> 03:10:02,200
Oh my god.

7635
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:02,880
Hiro!

7636
03:10:06,020 --> 03:10:07,740
They're right behind you.

7637
03:10:07,900 --> 03:10:09,560
Hiro, they're right behind you.

7638
03:10:09,560 --> 03:10:09,560
No.

7639
03:10:09,560 --> 03:10:10,020
We fight.

7640
03:10:10,340 --> 03:10:10,920
We fight.

7641
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:12,020
I need to fight him.

7642
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:14,300
We don't have anything.

7643
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:16,660
What do you mean we fight?

7644
03:10:17,420 --> 03:10:18,680
I EMP'd him.

7645
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:19,160
It's okay.

7646
03:10:19,700 --> 03:10:21,060
There's another team here.

7647
03:10:21,060 --> 03:10:22,080
There's a team right here.

7648
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:24,720
There's a team right here.

7649
03:10:24,760 --> 03:10:25,820
Okay, go ahead.

7650
03:10:25,860 --> 03:10:26,380
Guys.

7651
03:10:27,960 --> 03:10:28,640
It's okay.

7652
03:10:28,740 --> 03:10:28,980
It's okay.

7653
03:10:29,160 --> 03:10:30,360
There's a team right...

7654
03:10:30,360 --> 03:10:32,480
Guys, there's a team right in front of me.

7655
03:10:32,620 --> 03:10:33,140
Why?

7656
03:10:34,500 --> 03:10:35,780
How can I survive?

7657
03:10:36,320 --> 03:10:36,840
Guys.

7658
03:10:37,960 --> 03:10:40,000
I think I'm gonna die to the zone.

7659
03:10:40,320 --> 03:10:41,840
I'm gonna risk this.

7660
03:10:42,740 --> 03:10:43,260
Syringe!

7661
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:44,220
Oh no.

7662
03:10:44,440 --> 03:10:45,060
Oh no.

7663
03:10:47,480 --> 03:10:48,220
Hiro, live.

7664
03:10:48,340 --> 03:10:49,100
Hiro, just live.

7665
03:10:51,380 --> 03:10:52,180
Hiro, no!

7666
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:53,700
Hiro, no!

7667
03:10:53,840 --> 03:10:54,440
I can't live.

7668
03:10:54,460 --> 03:10:54,980
I can't live.

7669
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:55,780
You guys gotta live.

7670
03:10:57,180 --> 03:10:58,880
There's another team here.

7671
03:10:59,040 --> 03:10:59,420
Oh my god.

7672
03:10:59,540 --> 03:11:00,540
They're in front of me.

7673
03:11:01,700 --> 03:11:02,780
They're in front of me, too.

7674
03:11:03,360 --> 03:11:04,080
Oh my god.

7675
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:05,800
No!

7676
03:11:06,880 --> 03:11:08,040
Ditto, you gotta live.

7677
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:09,240
You gotta live, Ditto.

7678
03:11:09,360 --> 03:11:11,340
I don't help.

7679
03:11:12,520 --> 03:11:15,960
You can come to my spot, Ditto.

7680
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:17,220
I have heal.

7681
03:11:19,080 --> 03:11:21,320
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying!

7682
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:25,000
Just follow me!

7683
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:28,700
Just follow me!

7684
03:11:28,860 --> 03:11:29,320
It's okay.

7685
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:30,480
It's okay.

7686
03:11:30,660 --> 03:11:33,300
Wait, I don't think Ditto can even res you.

7687
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:34,600
She's so low.

7688
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:36,760
Oh no, it's them again!

7689
03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:37,260
It's them!

7690
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:39,200
Oh my god!

7691
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:41,080
They have Pathfinder!

7692
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:42,900
Pathfinder and Revenant!

7693
03:11:43,140 --> 03:11:44,440
They chased us!

7694
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:47,000
Oh my god, it's them again!

7695
03:11:48,260 --> 03:11:49,300
Holy shit!

7696
03:11:52,160 --> 03:11:54,140
Okay, we're just trolling, you know?

7697
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:54,920
Yeah, yeah guys.

7698
03:11:55,060 --> 03:11:57,220
We're not playing our best right now.

7699
03:11:57,280 --> 03:11:58,820
We were like...

7700
03:11:58,820 --> 03:12:00,500
No, just res here, res here.

7701
03:12:01,660 --> 03:12:03,040
You know, we...

7702
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:05,800
We actually played smart.

7703
03:12:05,900 --> 03:12:07,920
We would not have resed there.

7704
03:12:12,940 --> 03:12:14,400
We were just...

7705
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:15,660
Just trolling, guys.

7706
03:12:17,220 --> 03:12:17,700
Okay.

7707
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:21,120
Okay.

7708
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:23,020
Guys, if we wanted to try...

7709
03:12:23,020 --> 03:12:23,820
We won't troll.

7710
03:12:23,820 --> 03:12:24,120
We won't troll.

7711
03:12:24,120 --> 03:12:25,800
Yeah, we won't troll this time.

7712
03:12:25,820 --> 03:12:27,140
We won't troll this time.

7713
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:30,500
If we don't troll, we're gonna keep winning again.

7714
03:12:30,700 --> 03:12:32,180
Yeah, yeah guys.

7715
03:12:37,320 --> 03:12:37,880
See you.

7716
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:39,420
Winning all the time is like boring, right?

7717
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:41,300
Yeah, winning all the time is so boring.

7718
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:43,580
We gotta make it more challenging, you know?

7719
03:12:43,580 --> 03:12:44,600
We gotta make it harder.

7720
03:12:44,960 --> 03:12:45,060
We gotta make it harder.

7721
03:12:45,060 --> 03:12:45,540
You know?

7722
03:12:48,080 --> 03:12:48,680
Alright.

7723
03:12:54,560 --> 03:12:55,840
Where do we go?

7724
03:12:58,260 --> 03:12:59,160
I don't know.

7725
03:12:59,360 --> 03:12:59,940
You...

7726
03:12:59,940 --> 03:13:00,920
You jump.

7727
03:13:01,080 --> 03:13:01,540
Where do we go?

7728
03:13:02,180 --> 03:13:02,780
Ditto.

7729
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:03,560
Um...

7730
03:13:03,560 --> 03:13:04,300
You...

7731
03:13:04,300 --> 03:13:05,100
You decide.

7732
03:13:05,560 --> 03:13:06,160
No.

7733
03:13:09,300 --> 03:13:09,900
No.

7734
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:12,140
I will never decide.

7735
03:13:12,140 --> 03:13:13,100
I will never decide.

7736
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:22,160
Ditto.

7737
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:23,460
Yeah, but...

7738
03:13:23,460 --> 03:13:24,980
You loose.

7739
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:26,200
You are going to just go back tomorrow.

7740
03:13:26,920 --> 03:13:27,140
You are going to...

7741
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:31,480
I'm..

7742
03:13:31,480 --> 03:13:31,860
Sorry Hammu.

7743
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:33,860
I'm so sorry, no other game.

7744
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:34,320
Okay that's enough.

7745
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:34,680
Alright, that's enough?

7746
03:13:34,820 --> 03:13:35,560
That's enough?

7747
03:13:35,660 --> 03:13:35,680
I agree.

7748
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:36,040
Okay.

7749
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:37,920
Yo, that's enough.

7750
03:13:38,660 --> 03:13:39,960
Get the...

7751
03:13:40,740 --> 03:13:42,220
Leave it right now.

7752
03:13:42,220 --> 03:13:42,400
I saw them.

7753
03:13:42,460 --> 03:13:43,100
Landing on us.

7754
03:13:43,640 --> 03:13:44,680
Okay, okay.

7755
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:46,320
Yeah, see, I saw them landing on us.

7756
03:13:46,580 --> 03:13:48,140
Wait, they're actually on us, yeah.

7757
03:13:48,400 --> 03:13:48,740
Yeah, yeah.

7758
03:13:48,940 --> 03:13:49,340
On me.

7759
03:13:53,580 --> 03:13:54,500
One here, one here.

7760
03:13:54,640 --> 03:13:55,000
Oh no.

7761
03:13:56,860 --> 03:13:57,660
I got one.

7762
03:13:58,140 --> 03:13:58,660
I got one.

7763
03:13:59,280 --> 03:13:59,860
Oh my god!

7764
03:14:00,040 --> 03:14:00,760
I have...

7765
03:14:00,760 --> 03:14:02,040
Wait, we have two squads on us.

7766
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:02,280
Oh my god!

7767
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:03,640
I have... I have one thing!

7768
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:04,320
I have one thing!

7769
03:14:04,580 --> 03:14:05,080
Oh no!

7770
03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:07,260
I just knocked one here.

7771
03:14:07,440 --> 03:14:07,920
Okay, okay, okay.

7772
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:08,820
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

7773
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:11,140
Okay, one guy here, one guy here.

7774
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:12,000
Okay, okay, I'm heading over.

7775
03:14:12,080 --> 03:14:12,320
I'm heading over.

7776
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:14,060
Oh shit, he... he killed.

7777
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:15,560
He put a... he put a...

7778
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:16,500
Wait, he's finishing!

7779
03:14:16,740 --> 03:14:17,060
Finish, finish!

7780
03:14:17,400 --> 03:14:18,080
Oh my god.

7781
03:14:21,380 --> 03:14:21,820
Okay.

7782
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:22,300
Here, here, here.

7783
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:23,540
Maybe you can tab us?

7784
03:14:23,840 --> 03:14:24,280
Yeah.

7785
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:26,640
Oh, they're still here, they're still here, they're still here.

7786
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:27,440
Okay.

7787
03:14:27,540 --> 03:14:28,500
Oh god.

7788
03:14:28,660 --> 03:14:29,200
Another squad.

7789
03:14:29,500 --> 03:14:30,620
Wait, there's another team.

7790
03:14:30,820 --> 03:14:30,880
We got another squad!

7791
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:32,080
It's an enemy!

7792
03:14:32,340 --> 03:14:33,460
Oh god.

7793
03:14:33,860 --> 03:14:34,720
Yeah, it's good, it's good.

7794
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:35,420
Oh god.

7795
03:14:35,460 --> 03:14:36,360
Ditto, ditto, ditto!

7796
03:14:37,320 --> 03:14:37,760
Wait!

7797
03:14:37,960 --> 03:14:38,580
I'm alive!

7798
03:14:39,240 --> 03:14:40,180
We're two here!

7799
03:14:40,600 --> 03:14:41,940
Run, run, run, run!

7800
03:14:42,320 --> 03:14:43,000
Just run, just run.

7801
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:46,140
There's so many people.

7802
03:14:46,280 --> 03:14:46,860
There's two people here.

7803
03:14:47,400 --> 03:14:48,260
There's just too many.

7804
03:14:48,560 --> 03:14:50,020
There's too many, there's too many people.

7805
03:14:50,020 --> 03:14:50,920
I have no ammo, I have no more ammo.

7806
03:14:50,920 --> 03:14:51,900
Why did they land on us?

7807
03:14:51,980 --> 03:14:53,760
I have no ammo, I have more ammo.

7808
03:14:53,940 --> 03:14:55,280
I couldn't even get a platter.

7809
03:14:56,260 --> 03:14:56,980
Holy sh...

7810
03:14:56,980 --> 03:14:58,420
Oh my god, they landed here too!

7811
03:14:59,780 --> 03:15:00,220
Oh no!

7812
03:15:00,220 --> 03:15:01,780
Wait, go, um, the tree?

7813
03:15:01,960 --> 03:15:02,500
How about the tree?

7814
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:03,720
You can, you can jump tower.

7815
03:15:04,020 --> 03:15:05,360
Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

7816
03:15:05,360 --> 03:15:06,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7817
03:15:06,800 --> 03:15:07,600
Oh my god!

7818
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:08,380
What the fuck?

7819
03:15:09,240 --> 03:15:11,060
Do you have any light to jump tower?

7820
03:15:11,180 --> 03:15:11,940
Oh my god!

7821
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:12,300
Oh my god!

7822
03:15:12,300 --> 03:15:13,220
Oh my god!

7823
03:15:13,220 --> 03:15:14,460
I don't have ammo!

7824
03:15:15,820 --> 03:15:16,620
What the...

7825
03:15:16,620 --> 03:15:17,600
It's okay, no, no, no.

7826
03:15:17,720 --> 03:15:18,940
We're still trolling, don't worry.

7827
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:20,260
Yeah, we're still trolling, guys.

7828
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:21,380
We're still...

7829
03:15:22,300 --> 03:15:24,640
Oh, I made two teams fight each other!

7830
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:26,980
Oh, wait, wait, A1!

7831
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:28,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I started in a fight.

7832
03:15:28,900 --> 03:15:29,580
Wait, look.

7833
03:15:29,780 --> 03:15:31,060
We are in the plat lobby.

7834
03:15:31,380 --> 03:15:32,820
Yeah, we're in the plat lobby, guys.

7835
03:15:32,860 --> 03:15:33,080
Look.

7836
03:15:33,240 --> 03:15:33,500
Okay, okay.

7837
03:15:33,700 --> 03:15:34,500
Look, look, look.

7838
03:15:34,500 --> 03:15:35,340
We have to get it.

7839
03:15:36,900 --> 03:15:38,580
Guys, we should try it now, guys.

7840
03:15:38,640 --> 03:15:39,420
We're in the plat lobby.

7841
03:15:40,200 --> 03:15:40,600
Okay.

7842
03:15:41,880 --> 03:15:42,280
We're in the plat lobby, guys.

7843
03:15:42,300 --> 03:15:44,120
Wait, is it a plat already?

7844
03:15:44,340 --> 03:15:44,840
No, right?

7845
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:45,680
No, no, no.

7846
03:15:45,780 --> 03:15:46,660
No, we're just in the...

7847
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:46,880
Yeah.

7848
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:49,300
She just gold one, so we get moved to plat.

7849
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:51,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going to move to plat lobby.

7850
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:55,880
Okay, now we know that the players are a lot better now.

7851
03:15:59,400 --> 03:16:02,160
We can't randomly play around anymore.

7852
03:16:03,060 --> 03:16:05,360
We have to play position, positioning.

7853
03:16:06,120 --> 03:16:06,880
Oh my god.

7854
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:09,440
Oh, I guess I'll play positioning.

7855
03:16:10,680 --> 03:16:11,160
Yeah.

7856
03:16:11,800 --> 03:16:12,280
I'm gonna play positioning.

7857
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:16,420
Wait, I thought you said pathfinder is bad.

7858
03:16:16,740 --> 03:16:17,740
Why are you playing pathfinder?

7859
03:16:17,740 --> 03:16:18,680
Pathfinder is slow.

7860
03:16:18,960 --> 03:16:19,440
Yeah.

7861
03:16:20,200 --> 03:16:21,240
Pathfinder is good.

7862
03:16:22,340 --> 03:16:23,360
Why is he good?

7863
03:16:28,140 --> 03:16:28,780
All right.

7864
03:16:29,500 --> 03:16:30,400
See, look.

7865
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:31,020
They're masters.

7866
03:16:33,840 --> 03:16:35,920
Wait, they have a bronze on their team, too.

7867
03:16:37,900 --> 03:16:40,260
And two default skins.

7868
03:16:40,760 --> 03:16:41,240
Okay.

7869
03:16:42,220 --> 03:16:42,880
Here we go.

7870
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:43,720
Oh, we're landing soon.

7871
03:16:43,720 --> 03:16:44,680
I'm running safe now too.

7872
03:16:44,820 --> 03:16:48,260
Hey, how come now Pathfinder is good after you say Pathfinder is garbage?

7873
03:16:49,780 --> 03:16:51,340
I didn't say that.

7874
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:53,140
I just said that he was low.

7875
03:16:53,680 --> 03:16:55,660
No, you said he was big hitbox.

7876
03:16:56,860 --> 03:16:57,900
Didn't you say that?

7877
03:16:58,720 --> 03:16:59,180
It's okay.

7878
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:01,280
I can play Pathfinder.

7879
03:17:03,160 --> 03:17:04,700
Now it's okay.

7880
03:17:05,460 --> 03:17:07,760
Now I know how to move.

7881
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:08,920
I know, yeah.

7882
03:17:10,340 --> 03:17:11,860
My memory is back.

7883
03:17:11,860 --> 03:17:15,060
Okay, now you remember how to play FPS games.

7884
03:17:15,500 --> 03:17:16,020
Yeah.

7885
03:17:18,380 --> 03:17:19,540
Sudden memory loss.

7886
03:17:19,800 --> 03:17:20,040
Yeah.

7887
03:17:20,900 --> 03:17:22,140
Yes, yes, yes.

7888
03:17:22,980 --> 03:17:24,160
Okay, now I know.

7889
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:25,240
It's okay.

7890
03:17:25,320 --> 03:17:28,840
After playing Horizon, she learned how to play Pathfinder.

7891
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:29,500
Pathfinder, yeah.

7892
03:17:29,500 --> 03:17:30,260
That's how it works.

7893
03:17:31,540 --> 03:17:32,060
Yeah.

7894
03:17:32,620 --> 03:17:33,980
Here you go, little.

7895
03:17:37,960 --> 03:17:40,300
Wingman on Pathfinder is kind of scary.

7896
03:17:40,660 --> 03:17:41,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7897
03:17:41,420 --> 03:17:42,440
I mean, we saw her.

7898
03:17:42,500 --> 03:17:44,260
You scared everybody away.

7899
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:47,340
Yeah, we saw you on the Wingman as Pathfinder.

7900
03:17:47,360 --> 03:17:48,120
It was really scary.

7901
03:17:48,560 --> 03:17:49,580
I say, I say.

7902
03:17:50,740 --> 03:17:53,340
But I'm not gonna use Wingman in this lobby.

7903
03:17:53,900 --> 03:17:54,920
You're not going to?

7904
03:17:55,080 --> 03:17:55,380
Okay.

7905
03:17:55,940 --> 03:17:56,940
Oh, I have it.

7906
03:17:58,160 --> 03:18:01,040
Like, everyone has a good aim.

7907
03:18:01,240 --> 03:18:02,200
Yeah, that's true.

7908
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:02,700
Oh, no!

7909
03:18:03,700 --> 03:18:04,660
You got blue!

7910
03:18:05,380 --> 03:18:06,360
What happened?

7911
03:18:06,760 --> 03:18:07,180
No!

7912
03:18:07,180 --> 03:18:07,960
I got purple!

7913
03:18:08,560 --> 03:18:09,800
Ditto, I saw blue!

7914
03:18:10,180 --> 03:18:11,260
Why did you say oh no?

7915
03:18:11,900 --> 03:18:12,300
Why?

7916
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:14,000
Why did you say oh no?

7917
03:18:14,600 --> 03:18:15,240
Then why...

7918
03:18:15,240 --> 03:18:15,800
Why you said blue?

7919
03:18:16,140 --> 03:18:17,060
Then why did you say...

7920
03:18:17,060 --> 03:18:17,640
I got purple here.

7921
03:18:18,140 --> 03:18:19,400
Then why did you say...

7922
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:20,960
Then why did you say oh no?

7923
03:18:21,880 --> 03:18:23,000
Because I got purple.

7924
03:18:23,860 --> 03:18:25,140
But why were you...

7925
03:18:25,140 --> 03:18:25,540
Did you say...

7926
03:18:25,540 --> 03:18:26,740
Why were you sad about it?

7927
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:29,020
She wants gold?

7928
03:18:29,300 --> 03:18:29,880
No, no.

7929
03:18:29,920 --> 03:18:30,640
Yeah, I want gold.

7930
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:32,200
I want gold.

7931
03:18:32,200 --> 03:18:32,380
I want gold.

7932
03:18:32,880 --> 03:18:32,980
I want gold.

7933
03:18:33,420 --> 03:18:34,440
I was like, wait.

7934
03:18:34,580 --> 03:18:35,260
Ditto's chat.

7935
03:18:35,360 --> 03:18:35,860
Ditto's chat.

7936
03:18:35,980 --> 03:18:37,020
Can you clip that gold?

7937
03:18:37,180 --> 03:18:39,300
You can clip that purple that she got?

7938
03:18:39,340 --> 03:18:39,380
No, here.

7939
03:18:39,620 --> 03:18:40,000
Here.

7940
03:18:40,380 --> 03:18:40,980
Ditto, can you...

7941
03:18:40,980 --> 03:18:41,240
Here.

7942
03:18:41,260 --> 03:18:42,860
Who do you trust?

7943
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:44,080
Who do you believe?

7944
03:18:44,140 --> 03:18:45,760
I'm talking about your chat.

7945
03:18:46,060 --> 03:18:47,160
I'm talking about your chat.

7946
03:18:47,360 --> 03:18:47,640
No, no.

7947
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:48,300
I'm asking.

7948
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:49,260
I'm asking Hiro.

7949
03:18:49,260 --> 03:18:49,740
God.

7950
03:18:49,820 --> 03:18:50,300
God.

7951
03:18:50,360 --> 03:18:51,400
I gotta go to the toilet.

7952
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:53,220
Like, I gotta go back now.

7953
03:18:53,340 --> 03:18:53,560
No.

7954
03:18:53,580 --> 03:18:54,580
No, Hiro!

7955
03:18:56,140 --> 03:18:56,620
Hiro!

7956
03:18:56,620 --> 03:18:56,780
I don't...

7957
03:18:56,780 --> 03:18:57,120
Hiro, no.

7958
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:57,960
You have to choose.

7959
03:18:58,040 --> 03:19:00,400
I don't think Hiro trusts you, Ditto.

7960
03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:03,240
I don't think she trusts you.

7961
03:19:03,620 --> 03:19:05,000
Oh, Hiro ignores.

7962
03:19:05,340 --> 03:19:07,000
Yeah, she doesn't trust you.

7963
03:19:07,740 --> 03:19:08,220
That's why.

7964
03:19:08,260 --> 03:19:10,100
She doesn't trust you too.

7965
03:19:10,320 --> 03:19:11,240
No, she trusts you.

7966
03:19:11,240 --> 03:19:11,820
She trusts me.

7967
03:19:11,820 --> 03:19:12,060
She trusts...

7968
03:19:12,060 --> 03:19:14,760
She believes me when I said you didn't get purple.

7969
03:19:14,980 --> 03:19:16,180
She didn't say that.

7970
03:19:16,900 --> 03:19:17,380
Hiro.

7971
03:19:17,620 --> 03:19:18,420
She didn't say that.

7972
03:19:19,740 --> 03:19:20,220
Hiro.

7973
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:22,360
Hiro.

7974
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:23,080
Hiro.

7975
03:19:23,080 --> 03:19:23,780
You have to choose.

7976
03:19:24,680 --> 03:19:25,160
Hiro.

7977
03:19:25,160 --> 03:19:25,200
Hiro.

7978
03:19:25,200 --> 03:19:25,780
I have to choose?

7979
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:29,080
Hiro, if you don't choose, somebody in the world is gonna die.

7980
03:19:29,900 --> 03:19:30,160
Hiro.

7981
03:19:30,360 --> 03:19:30,840
Hiro.

7982
03:19:30,940 --> 03:19:31,420
Hiro.

7983
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:32,560
Hiro.

7984
03:19:33,100 --> 03:19:34,320
You gotta pick.

7985
03:19:34,540 --> 03:19:35,160
Alright, guys.

7986
03:19:35,160 --> 03:19:35,620
Here is...

7987
03:19:35,620 --> 03:19:36,820
I forgot.

7988
03:19:36,920 --> 03:19:39,740
Whoever this is most damage, I'll trust you.

7989
03:19:39,760 --> 03:19:40,300
My PID.

7990
03:19:40,300 --> 03:19:45,160
I'm going to play the red keychain that I can never see because nobody ever runs R9 anymore.

7991
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:51,740
Wait, earlier that octane was running R99...

7992
03:19:52,140 --> 03:19:53,660
Ugh, she doesn't count.

7993
03:19:53,920 --> 03:19:55,120
That octane doesn't count.

7994
03:19:58,600 --> 03:19:59,240
Octane?

7995
03:19:59,260 --> 03:19:59,760
Doctane?

7996
03:20:00,380 --> 03:20:01,860
The octane doesn't count.

7997
03:20:01,960 --> 03:20:02,300
Alright.

7998
03:20:02,620 --> 03:20:04,740
I rarely see it though, honestly.

7999
03:20:05,120 --> 03:20:06,380
Yeah, I rarely see the R9.

8000
03:20:07,060 --> 03:20:08,620
Wait, they didn't open this VIN.

8001
03:20:09,500 --> 03:20:13,040
I want to go to the dome to grab something.

8002
03:20:13,500 --> 03:20:14,240
Alright, okay.

8003
03:20:14,620 --> 03:20:16,980
And we have to... evil armor.

8004
03:20:17,220 --> 03:20:19,560
Oh yeah, we need evil armor, yeah.

8005
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:23,360
But here, I give Doki this thing.

8006
03:20:23,900 --> 03:20:25,300
Oh, yeah I need that.

8007
03:20:25,740 --> 03:20:27,020
I'll take it long.

8008
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:27,860
Okay.

8009
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:29,640
I want a scope too.

8010
03:20:30,440 --> 03:20:31,740
Wait, what kind of scope?

8011
03:20:32,960 --> 03:20:35,040
2 of... 2?

8012
03:20:35,460 --> 03:20:36,900
2H or G?

8013
03:20:37,100 --> 03:20:38,320
Alright, we'll find.

8014
03:20:38,320 --> 03:20:39,980
Any scope, any scope.

8015
03:20:40,300 --> 03:20:41,300
Okay, I'll go find.

8016
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:44,840
Chat, you know we're serious when we start crafting.

8017
03:20:46,340 --> 03:20:49,960
We were not crafting earlier, now we actually have to craft.

8018
03:20:50,180 --> 03:20:51,320
We just randomly...

8019
03:20:51,320 --> 03:20:55,180
Oh wait, I have to go get that evil harvester.

8020
03:20:55,440 --> 03:20:57,880
Yeah, you were supposed to craft the evil harvester.

8021
03:20:58,200 --> 03:20:58,820
You know?

8022
03:20:59,400 --> 03:20:59,920
Okay.

8023
03:21:00,080 --> 03:21:01,160
You were ahead of us.

8024
03:21:01,840 --> 03:21:02,260
Yeah.

8025
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:04,360
They're actually fighting here.

8026
03:21:05,020 --> 03:21:06,000
Oh wait, we should go for that.

8027
03:21:06,340 --> 03:21:06,940
Be careful.

8028
03:21:08,320 --> 03:21:10,640
There might be over 2 teams.

8029
03:21:11,140 --> 03:21:11,580
Okay.

8030
03:21:11,740 --> 03:21:13,740
I mean we can tell from Hiro's thing.

8031
03:21:14,700 --> 03:21:15,140
Yeah.

8032
03:21:15,440 --> 03:21:16,360
I'll check.

8033
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:20,240
Where are they fighting?

8034
03:21:20,460 --> 03:21:21,920
They're fighting over in this town?

8035
03:21:22,080 --> 03:21:22,740
Yeah, over there.

8036
03:21:22,860 --> 03:21:23,780
Yeah, in the town.

8037
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:25,800
I can like scout it out now too.

8038
03:21:25,920 --> 03:21:26,760
I don't need anything here.

8039
03:21:27,500 --> 03:21:28,600
Are they high fighting?

8040
03:21:29,880 --> 03:21:30,320
No.

8041
03:21:30,380 --> 03:21:30,520
I'm checking.

8042
03:21:30,960 --> 03:21:31,840
They are fighting.

8043
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:32,920
They are fighting right now.

8044
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:33,880
They're still fighting.

8045
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:34,980
Okay.

8046
03:21:35,400 --> 03:21:36,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8047
03:21:36,200 --> 03:21:36,920
Right here, right here.

8048
03:21:36,980 --> 03:21:38,080
They're fighting right in front of me.

8049
03:21:38,080 --> 03:21:38,660
I'm going, I'm going.

8050
03:21:38,720 --> 03:21:39,080
Okay, okay.

8051
03:21:39,080 --> 03:21:40,280
I'm going, I'm going.

8052
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:42,600
They're hard fighting now.

8053
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:43,060
They're hard fighting.

8054
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:44,200
Okay, okay.

8055
03:21:44,220 --> 03:21:44,840
They're high ground.

8056
03:21:44,860 --> 03:21:45,100
Okay.

8057
03:21:45,320 --> 03:21:45,660
Here.

8058
03:21:46,460 --> 03:21:46,820
Okay.

8059
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:48,300
Can you put a zip?

8060
03:21:48,620 --> 03:21:49,320
Okay, okay.

8061
03:21:49,380 --> 03:21:50,380
I will use the zip line.

8062
03:21:50,480 --> 03:21:50,680
Here.

8063
03:21:50,720 --> 03:21:51,220
Okay, okay, okay.

8064
03:21:51,240 --> 03:21:53,160
Then I will go and heal them now.

8065
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:55,200
I'm gonna...

8066
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:57,180
I'm climbing up on the stairs.

8067
03:21:58,480 --> 03:21:58,740
Okay.

8068
03:21:58,900 --> 03:22:00,560
They have one knock at least.

8069
03:22:00,640 --> 03:22:01,120
They're listening.

8070
03:22:01,220 --> 03:22:03,340
They have at least one knock.

8071
03:22:05,480 --> 03:22:05,920
All right.

8072
03:22:05,940 --> 03:22:06,740
Down here, down here.

8073
03:22:08,080 --> 03:22:08,580
He's down here.

8074
03:22:09,100 --> 03:22:09,760
Flesh, flesh.

8075
03:22:09,820 --> 03:22:11,000
Oh, they're running, they're running, they're running.

8076
03:22:11,300 --> 03:22:12,080
There's one down there.

8077
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:13,120
Yeah, that guy is Flesh.

8078
03:22:13,120 --> 03:22:14,240
Here, here, here, here.

8079
03:22:14,440 --> 03:22:14,800
Um...

8080
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:15,080
Okay.

8081
03:22:18,140 --> 03:22:18,500
Inside?

8082
03:22:18,680 --> 03:22:19,640
They were Flesh, yeah.

8083
03:22:19,860 --> 03:22:20,120
Down.

8084
03:22:20,220 --> 03:22:20,580
Yeah.

8085
03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:22,120
Two people, two people.

8086
03:22:23,180 --> 03:22:23,720
Inside here.

8087
03:22:24,680 --> 03:22:25,040
Okay.

8088
03:22:25,100 --> 03:22:25,220
Okay.

8089
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:26,580
I think they're running.

8090
03:22:27,680 --> 03:22:28,460
Here, here, here, here.

8091
03:22:28,620 --> 03:22:29,820
Outside, outside, outside.

8092
03:22:29,960 --> 03:22:30,180
There's one here.

8093
03:22:31,580 --> 03:22:33,340
Oh, one Flesh, one Flesh.

8094
03:22:34,960 --> 03:22:35,840
There's one over here?

8095
03:22:36,420 --> 03:22:37,120
There's one running.

8096
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:38,620
They're all running.

8097
03:22:40,860 --> 03:22:41,520
Oh my god.

8098
03:22:42,020 --> 03:22:42,920
Wait, wait, wait.

8099
03:22:42,920 --> 03:22:43,560
On me, on me, on me.

8100
03:22:43,640 --> 03:22:44,300
Yeah, he did it.

8101
03:22:44,320 --> 03:22:44,640
I'm with you.

8102
03:22:46,280 --> 03:22:47,580
If you lose that one, we won.

8103
03:22:47,580 --> 03:22:47,780
I'm here.

8104
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:48,240
Inside the building.

8105
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:49,340
Okay.

8106
03:22:50,440 --> 03:22:51,680
I am heading to Ditto.

8107
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:51,880
Second floor.

8108
03:22:52,120 --> 03:22:52,840
There's one over there.

8109
03:22:53,280 --> 03:22:54,060
There's one over here.

8110
03:22:54,060 --> 03:22:55,480
He's running to him, I'm pretty sure.

8111
03:22:55,880 --> 03:22:56,220
Yeah.

8112
03:22:56,300 --> 03:22:57,300
They're together.

8113
03:22:58,460 --> 03:22:59,300
Broke, broke, broke, broke.

8114
03:22:59,380 --> 03:22:59,920
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

8115
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:00,760
I'm pushing up.

8116
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:01,140
Nice.

8117
03:23:01,520 --> 03:23:02,380
Are they rising or no?

8118
03:23:02,560 --> 03:23:03,580
I finished one team.

8119
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:04,780
Okay.

8120
03:23:04,880 --> 03:23:05,840
Right here, right here, right here.

8121
03:23:05,920 --> 03:23:06,060
He's running.

8122
03:23:06,380 --> 03:23:06,720
Okay.

8123
03:23:08,740 --> 03:23:09,820
They're using jump pad.

8124
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:11,680
No, advantage, advantage.

8125
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:12,920
I hear them.

8126
03:23:13,140 --> 03:23:14,220
Right here, right here, right here.

8127
03:23:14,360 --> 03:23:15,420
Yeah, right in front of me, right in front of me.

8128
03:23:17,340 --> 03:23:18,300
Oh my god.

8129
03:23:18,880 --> 03:23:19,540
He's not low.

8130
03:23:19,920 --> 03:23:20,280
Yeah.

8131
03:23:20,540 --> 03:23:21,160
He's dead.

8132
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:21,700
Okay, I got the belt.

8133
03:23:22,540 --> 03:23:23,200
Where's the last guy?

8134
03:23:23,260 --> 03:23:23,960
Another one is running.

8135
03:23:24,240 --> 03:23:24,740
Yeah, yeah.

8136
03:23:25,480 --> 03:23:26,420
He's running, he's running.

8137
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:26,840
Yeah.

8138
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:28,840
I'm gonna thirst him.

8139
03:23:28,860 --> 03:23:29,840
I'm thirsting him for loot.

8140
03:23:30,880 --> 03:23:31,240
Okay.

8141
03:23:31,260 --> 03:23:31,880
We don't have anything.

8142
03:23:32,080 --> 03:23:33,400
Oh, new team, new team, new team.

8143
03:23:33,580 --> 03:23:34,240
Behind us.

8144
03:23:35,060 --> 03:23:38,060
Okay, we have to, we have to go to the other side.

8145
03:23:38,060 --> 03:23:39,220
Oh, we have to push.

8146
03:23:39,400 --> 03:23:40,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8147
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:40,500
I'm coming over.

8148
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:42,400
There's a new team right here.

8149
03:23:42,460 --> 03:23:42,980
There's a new team here.

8150
03:23:43,580 --> 03:23:43,980
Okay.

8151
03:23:44,100 --> 03:23:45,420
We have to go to zone anyway.

8152
03:23:45,620 --> 03:23:45,880
He's here.

8153
03:23:45,960 --> 03:23:46,840
He's hiding here.

8154
03:23:47,020 --> 03:23:47,340
Hello.

8155
03:23:50,140 --> 03:23:51,340
We know you're here.

8156
03:23:52,840 --> 03:23:54,060
Oh my god, I'm in M-San.

8157
03:23:54,200 --> 03:23:54,700
Got him, I got him.

8158
03:23:54,760 --> 03:23:54,960
Wait.

8159
03:23:55,720 --> 03:23:56,120
There's...

8160
03:23:56,120 --> 03:23:56,780
Wait.

8161
03:23:57,080 --> 03:23:57,480
No.

8162
03:23:57,640 --> 03:23:58,420
Wait a minute.

8163
03:23:58,660 --> 03:23:58,920
Wait, wait.

8164
03:23:58,920 --> 03:23:59,360
Another one.

8165
03:23:59,400 --> 03:24:00,780
Yeah, wait a minute.

8166
03:24:00,900 --> 03:24:01,700
Wait, wait.

8167
03:24:02,560 --> 03:24:02,960
Here.

8168
03:24:03,060 --> 03:24:03,380
Why?

8169
03:24:03,720 --> 03:24:04,120
Here.

8170
03:24:05,140 --> 03:24:06,500
Wait a minute.

8171
03:24:07,180 --> 03:24:07,880
There's one.

8172
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:08,040
There's one.

8173
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:08,380
One more?

8174
03:24:11,220 --> 03:24:12,880
We gotta go to zone, I feel like.

8175
03:24:13,120 --> 03:24:13,720
Okay, okay.

8176
03:24:14,180 --> 03:24:15,080
How you going?

8177
03:24:15,320 --> 03:24:16,840
Um, lower siphon.

8178
03:24:17,140 --> 03:24:18,880
Yeah, I'm gonna go here and then take the zip.

8179
03:24:19,480 --> 03:24:20,100
Oh, nice.

8180
03:24:20,620 --> 03:24:21,820
And grab the Evo too.

8181
03:24:22,300 --> 03:24:23,180
Yeah, okay, okay.

8182
03:24:23,180 --> 03:24:23,400
Nice.

8183
03:24:23,520 --> 03:24:23,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8184
03:24:25,340 --> 03:24:26,140
Yeah, we're the...

8185
03:24:26,680 --> 03:24:27,900
We're like, wait a minute.

8186
03:24:27,980 --> 03:24:28,560
Why is...

8187
03:24:29,240 --> 03:24:30,240
The guy's not dead?

8188
03:24:30,740 --> 03:24:31,540
Not dead?

8189
03:24:31,980 --> 03:24:32,380
Oh.

8190
03:24:32,480 --> 03:24:32,840
Where is it?

8191
03:24:33,300 --> 03:24:33,860
Oh, here.

8192
03:24:34,140 --> 03:24:34,680
Oh, it's okay.

8193
03:24:34,740 --> 03:24:35,660
I'll just go...

8194
03:24:36,260 --> 03:24:36,780
Go alone?

8195
03:24:36,820 --> 03:24:37,840
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go scare.

8196
03:24:38,720 --> 03:24:40,000
Oh, another team here.

8197
03:24:40,460 --> 03:24:40,860
Okay.

8198
03:24:41,000 --> 03:24:42,620
We're here already.

8199
03:24:43,460 --> 03:24:44,800
You're by yourself, you're by yourself.

8200
03:24:44,980 --> 03:24:46,380
Oh my god, I'm trying to fly.

8201
03:24:46,700 --> 03:24:47,420
Oh, no!

8202
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:48,380
It's okay.

8203
03:24:48,500 --> 03:24:48,900
No!

8204
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:50,100
No!

8205
03:24:50,420 --> 03:24:50,800
No!

8206
03:24:51,400 --> 03:24:51,480
No!

8207
03:24:51,820 --> 03:24:53,660
We gotta run, we gotta run, we gotta run.

8208
03:24:54,980 --> 03:24:56,500
They're coming to us, they're coming to us.

8209
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:57,100
Only two!

8210
03:24:57,540 --> 03:24:58,740
You know, you know, you know, you know.

8211
03:24:58,940 --> 03:25:00,680
There's another one here, another one here.

8212
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:02,040
Only two and another one here.

8213
03:25:02,260 --> 03:25:02,880
Oh god!

8214
03:25:03,700 --> 03:25:04,100
Yeah!

8215
03:25:06,020 --> 03:25:06,420
No!

8216
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:07,400
Joy!

8217
03:25:07,420 --> 03:25:07,680
Joy!

8218
03:25:07,820 --> 03:25:07,980
Joy!

8219
03:25:07,980 --> 03:25:08,000
Joy!

8220
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:08,540
Joy!

8221
03:25:08,540 --> 03:25:09,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

8222
03:25:09,280 --> 03:25:09,560
Why?

8223
03:25:09,780 --> 03:25:10,500
You know, run!

8224
03:25:10,860 --> 03:25:12,980
You know, it's not smart to be here, you know?

8225
03:25:12,980 --> 03:25:13,580
Hey, they're teaching me.

8226
03:25:13,580 --> 03:25:13,720
You know?

8227
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:14,440
They know you.

8228
03:25:14,440 --> 03:25:16,300
I wanna run, I wanna run.

8229
03:25:16,400 --> 03:25:17,380
I really wanna run.

8230
03:25:17,540 --> 03:25:18,320
But like...

8231
03:25:19,600 --> 03:25:20,080
Wait...

8232
03:25:20,580 --> 03:25:21,060
What?

8233
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:24,040
From chasing people to getting chased.

8234
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:26,680
I don't know if I'm safe.

8235
03:25:26,840 --> 03:25:27,420
No, you're safe.

8236
03:25:27,420 --> 03:25:27,440
What?

8237
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:27,980
Wait, they're...

8238
03:25:27,980 --> 03:25:29,060
They, they...

8239
03:25:29,060 --> 03:25:29,940
Oh, that's what I'm saying.

8240
03:25:29,940 --> 03:25:32,100
Their ears or eyes are really good.

8241
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:38,020
Um, there's people on the left.

8242
03:25:39,180 --> 03:25:39,640
Okay.

8243
03:25:40,740 --> 03:25:42,780
But I don't have anywhere else to go.

8244
03:25:43,400 --> 03:25:44,720
Hiro, you might be able to come back.

8245
03:25:45,000 --> 03:25:46,000
I'm so safe.

8246
03:25:47,100 --> 03:25:49,080
Hiro, another team.

8247
03:25:49,920 --> 03:25:50,820
Oh, I'm not safe.

8248
03:25:50,880 --> 03:25:51,800
I'm not safe.

8249
03:25:51,880 --> 03:25:52,140
I lied.

8250
03:25:52,660 --> 03:25:53,440
They're right here.

8251
03:25:55,420 --> 03:25:56,900
I see the darkness.

8252
03:25:57,860 --> 03:25:58,900
Oh my god!

8253
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:04,260
Wait... wait, there's someone on my face!

8254
03:26:04,660 --> 03:26:06,760
No, they don't know, they don't know, they don't have a bloodhound.

8255
03:26:07,560 --> 03:26:09,300
There's no way they have a bloodhound.

8256
03:26:10,080 --> 03:26:10,960
What about me?

8257
03:26:12,200 --> 03:26:12,940
I'll get you.

8258
03:26:13,800 --> 03:26:15,840
I'll crawl closer, I'll crawl closer.

8259
03:26:16,700 --> 03:26:20,620
I'm crawling closer, I'm gonna die to the lava, but I'll crawl closer to you.

8260
03:26:20,640 --> 03:26:22,420
Maybe you can grab my banner?

8261
03:26:22,760 --> 03:26:23,920
Yeah, I'm gonna get it.

8262
03:26:24,520 --> 03:26:27,720
Don't worry, I'm closer to you, Hiro!

8263
03:26:28,320 --> 03:26:29,240
I'm closer!

8264
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:29,860
It's okay!

8265
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:33,580
I'm coming!

8266
03:26:34,080 --> 03:26:36,360
Wait, they threw so many shields out.

8267
03:26:36,880 --> 03:26:38,500
I'm outside the ring, by the way.

8268
03:26:38,520 --> 03:26:39,340
I'm outside the ring.

8269
03:26:39,560 --> 03:26:41,840
Don't worry, I'm watching your heels.

8270
03:26:42,800 --> 03:26:44,020
It's okay, it's okay.

8271
03:26:44,020 --> 03:26:45,060
It's okay, it's okay.

8272
03:26:45,280 --> 03:26:46,120
You're okay, you're okay.

8273
03:26:46,640 --> 03:26:48,880
Is it only ring one or two?

8274
03:26:48,940 --> 03:26:50,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's ring one, it's ring one.

8275
03:26:51,060 --> 03:26:51,420
No!

8276
03:26:55,660 --> 03:26:56,260
Don't worry!

8277
03:26:56,520 --> 03:26:56,760
Don't worry, don't worry.

8278
03:26:56,880 --> 03:26:58,600
Don't worry, you're just gonna get closer, you're getting closer.

8279
03:26:58,840 --> 03:26:59,520
Wait, it's ring two?

8280
03:27:01,400 --> 03:27:02,960
It's a little bit painful.

8281
03:27:03,340 --> 03:27:03,780
Wait.

8282
03:27:04,180 --> 03:27:05,120
Oh, you have to...

8283
03:27:05,720 --> 03:27:06,920
You have to heal first.

8284
03:27:07,320 --> 03:27:08,360
Yeah, you have to heal.

8285
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:10,840
Oh, oh, oh.

8286
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:12,480
It's okay, it's okay.

8287
03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:14,820
Oh, it'd be awkward if you cancelled your heal right now.

8288
03:27:17,860 --> 03:27:18,980
I'm being that.

8289
03:27:19,140 --> 03:27:19,820
I'm dead.

8290
03:27:21,540 --> 03:27:23,140
I can't get the banner.

8291
03:27:24,400 --> 03:27:26,380
I don't know if you should do that right now.

8292
03:27:26,460 --> 03:27:28,280
I don't know if you should do it while you're in the ring.

8293
03:27:28,440 --> 03:27:29,860
I don't... that's my...

8294
03:27:34,280 --> 03:27:35,440
I believe, I believe.

8295
03:27:36,360 --> 03:27:38,280
You grab, you grab...

8296
03:27:39,900 --> 03:27:42,380
Doki's banner and go to the tree.

8297
03:27:42,600 --> 03:27:45,320
You have to grab it now, there's 19 seconds left.

8298
03:27:45,640 --> 03:27:46,720
Okay, got it, I got it!

8299
03:27:47,260 --> 03:27:48,420
Here, right here.

8300
03:27:49,620 --> 03:27:50,060
Oh...

8301
03:27:51,060 --> 03:27:52,380
Oh, nine seconds.

8302
03:27:53,140 --> 03:27:53,580
Oh...

8303
03:27:53,580 --> 03:27:54,760
Got it, got it, got it!

8304
03:27:55,280 --> 03:27:56,720
Go fast, fast, fast, fast, fast!

8305
03:27:56,840 --> 03:27:57,040
Yeah!

8306
03:27:58,680 --> 03:28:00,200
Be careful, another team.

8307
03:28:00,620 --> 03:28:01,380
Reza's over there.

8308
03:28:01,460 --> 03:28:01,860
You see that?

8309
03:28:01,940 --> 03:28:02,580
Reza's over there.

8310
03:28:02,920 --> 03:28:03,860
Yeah, wait.

8311
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:05,500
You can make it.

8312
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:06,920
Is your drone far enough for that?

8313
03:28:09,920 --> 03:28:10,900
Are we gonna...

8314
03:28:12,100 --> 03:28:12,980
You're gonna die.

8315
03:28:13,320 --> 03:28:14,720
I have a respawn beacon.

8316
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:15,360
I have a beacon.

8317
03:28:15,620 --> 03:28:18,860
Yeah, but the moment you put that beacon down, everybody's gonna look at you.

8318
03:28:19,420 --> 03:28:20,920
How about, how about launch site?

8319
03:28:21,260 --> 03:28:22,700
Do you think... do you think...

8320
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:23,260
I can go here.

8321
03:28:23,260 --> 03:28:23,960
She's not gonna make it.

8322
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:25,500
There's no way there's someone underneath.

8323
03:28:25,900 --> 03:28:27,100
She's not gonna make it.

8324
03:28:27,460 --> 03:28:27,480
She's okay.

8325
03:28:28,360 --> 03:28:28,680
Yeah.

8326
03:28:28,700 --> 03:28:29,300
She doesn't see me.

8327
03:28:30,280 --> 03:28:31,380
She doesn't see me.

8328
03:28:31,400 --> 03:28:32,120
No, no, no, no, no.

8329
03:28:32,180 --> 03:28:32,580
There's sound.

8330
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:33,340
There's a sound.

8331
03:28:34,060 --> 03:28:34,740
There's people here.

8332
03:28:34,740 --> 03:28:35,520
Here, do you hear that?

8333
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:37,240
Go left, go left, go left, go left, go left.

8334
03:28:37,560 --> 03:28:37,580
Oh!

8335
03:28:37,580 --> 03:28:38,800
We should be able to climb it?

8336
03:28:39,640 --> 03:28:39,960
Oh!

8337
03:28:40,180 --> 03:28:40,920
Oh, okay.

8338
03:28:41,520 --> 03:28:42,740
Oh, there's people here though.

8339
03:28:44,500 --> 03:28:44,940
Is there?

8340
03:28:45,300 --> 03:28:46,060
I think so.

8341
03:28:46,840 --> 03:28:47,340
Is there?

8342
03:28:49,260 --> 03:28:49,780
There's none.

8343
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:51,840
Oh yeah, one team.

8344
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:52,640
We can't see them.

8345
03:28:52,660 --> 03:28:52,680
Is there?

8346
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:53,060
Where did this come from?

8347
03:28:53,060 --> 03:28:54,060
I think they're inside the house.

8348
03:28:54,860 --> 03:28:55,920
Be careful, be careful.

8349
03:28:56,280 --> 03:28:58,640
I think, yeah, I think they're inside the house.

8350
03:28:58,800 --> 03:28:59,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8351
03:28:59,300 --> 03:29:00,380
Why would it be like locked?

8352
03:29:01,940 --> 03:29:02,700
It's a cave.

8353
03:29:03,160 --> 03:29:04,880
We can, we can...

8354
03:29:04,880 --> 03:29:05,780
How do you get back up?

8355
03:29:06,140 --> 03:29:07,200
How do you get back up?

8356
03:29:10,340 --> 03:29:12,160
Hiro, how are you gonna get back up?

8357
03:29:13,400 --> 03:29:13,960
It's okay.

8358
03:29:14,440 --> 03:29:16,180
Hiro, how are you gonna get back up?

8359
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:16,580
Hiro!

8360
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:18,300
It's okay.

8361
03:29:19,540 --> 03:29:21,280
Hiro, you're stuck down there.

8362
03:29:21,300 --> 03:29:21,760
Which way?

8363
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:23,940
I'm gonna revive you.

8364
03:29:24,080 --> 03:29:24,760
You have to go back.

8365
03:29:25,220 --> 03:29:27,240
I don't think this is...

8366
03:29:28,680 --> 03:29:31,120
Hiro, I don't know, Hiro.

8367
03:29:31,960 --> 03:29:32,740
Don't worry.

8368
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:34,920
I'm gonna come back up, Hiro.

8369
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:36,080
This is round 3.

8370
03:29:36,860 --> 03:29:38,340
This is round 3.

8371
03:29:39,140 --> 03:29:40,060
I'm gonna revive.

8372
03:29:40,400 --> 03:29:41,680
I'm gonna revive you guys.

8373
03:29:42,520 --> 03:29:44,080
We're gonna revive us in zone?

8374
03:29:45,240 --> 03:29:46,080
Don't worry, dude.

8375
03:29:46,140 --> 03:29:48,000
At 30 seconds, I'll...

8376
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:50,760
No, 45, I'll put a respawn down.

8377
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:51,220
What?

8378
03:29:53,460 --> 03:29:54,320
Wait, but...

8379
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:55,460
How are you gonna...

8380
03:29:56,200 --> 03:29:58,920
No, then you guys can land on top.

8381
03:29:59,120 --> 03:29:59,880
And I'll...

8382
03:29:59,880 --> 03:30:00,740
I might die.

8383
03:30:03,920 --> 03:30:05,340
You're the zone 4.

8384
03:30:05,680 --> 03:30:06,980
Hiro, you're dying.

8385
03:30:07,500 --> 03:30:08,540
Okay, I believe.

8386
03:30:09,560 --> 03:30:10,660
Put it down, do it.

8387
03:30:10,960 --> 03:30:11,580
I believe.

8388
03:30:16,420 --> 03:30:17,640
Guys, are they still there?

8389
03:30:18,640 --> 03:30:20,100
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone, they're gone.

8390
03:30:20,840 --> 03:30:21,640
Oh, nice.

8391
03:30:21,880 --> 03:30:23,500
Maybe you can go...

8392
03:30:23,500 --> 03:30:26,120
Can you go back and come...

8393
03:30:26,760 --> 03:30:27,640
Come up here?

8394
03:30:27,800 --> 03:30:28,360
I'll try.

8395
03:30:29,740 --> 03:30:32,000
I don't know, I don't think so.

8396
03:30:32,280 --> 03:30:33,060
I don't believe.

8397
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:35,500
I don't believe.

8398
03:30:35,680 --> 03:30:37,380
I'm gonna watch Hiro's HP go down.

8399
03:30:39,560 --> 03:30:42,200
Can you activate the...

8400
03:30:42,200 --> 03:30:42,800
Oh no.

8401
03:30:44,040 --> 03:30:45,780
Oh my god, I'm safe.

8402
03:30:45,920 --> 03:30:47,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

8403
03:30:47,860 --> 03:30:49,100
Wait, wait, wait.

8404
03:30:50,760 --> 03:30:52,120
We have to go, guys.

8405
03:30:52,500 --> 03:30:54,400
Guys, we have to go.

8406
03:30:55,440 --> 03:30:56,720
Nice Hiro, nice.

8407
03:30:58,160 --> 03:30:59,400
Oh, nice Hiro lives.

8408
03:30:59,740 --> 03:31:04,220
The power of Ditto believing in you, you live.

8409
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:05,720
Okay.

8410
03:31:06,640 --> 03:31:08,140
Where do you have a creeper?

8411
03:31:08,300 --> 03:31:10,340
Oh, that creeper's gonna kill us.

8412
03:31:10,520 --> 03:31:11,200
Be careful, be careful.

8413
03:31:11,600 --> 03:31:13,640
I don't have healer.

8414
03:31:13,740 --> 03:31:15,240
We have to kill this.

8415
03:31:15,620 --> 03:31:17,500
I'm gonna EMP them right now.

8416
03:31:17,740 --> 03:31:18,100
Okay.

8417
03:31:18,880 --> 03:31:20,480
There's also a team right here.

8418
03:31:20,760 --> 03:31:21,180
They're fighting too.

8419
03:31:23,540 --> 03:31:24,500
Wait, they're not here.

8420
03:31:24,740 --> 03:31:25,180
They're not?

8421
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:25,820
They went here.

8422
03:31:26,200 --> 03:31:26,700
There's a loot.

8423
03:31:29,720 --> 03:31:30,740
Take the loot.

8424
03:31:31,180 --> 03:31:31,580
Go, go, go.

8425
03:31:32,840 --> 03:31:34,320
I have an ultimate cell for you.

8426
03:31:35,280 --> 03:31:36,480
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

8427
03:31:36,760 --> 03:31:37,540
Oh my god, this is ours now.

8428
03:31:38,240 --> 03:31:39,120
Wait, there's someone here.

8429
03:31:41,460 --> 03:31:42,260
There was.

8430
03:31:44,480 --> 03:31:45,260
It's okay, it's okay.

8431
03:31:46,080 --> 03:31:47,120
They went outside.

8432
03:31:47,120 --> 03:31:48,060
I don't feel okay.

8433
03:31:48,200 --> 03:31:48,440
The Pathfinder.

8434
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:52,300
Wait, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

8435
03:31:52,540 --> 03:31:53,180
How do we...

8436
03:31:53,180 --> 03:31:54,320
Wait, wait, wait.

8437
03:31:56,600 --> 03:31:57,740
Oh my god.

8438
03:31:57,980 --> 03:31:59,800
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

8439
03:32:00,520 --> 03:32:02,060
We are still alive.

8440
03:32:02,620 --> 03:32:03,880
We are still alive.

8441
03:32:11,020 --> 03:32:12,220
It's the Pathfinder.

8442
03:32:12,580 --> 03:32:13,840
Why did you all shoot?

8443
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:15,860
Where is the Pathfinder?

8444
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:18,100
Where is the Pathfinder?

8445
03:32:18,600 --> 03:32:19,480
Is he solo?

8446
03:32:20,640 --> 03:32:21,880
Where did he go?

8447
03:32:22,140 --> 03:32:23,680
Where did he come from?

8448
03:32:24,680 --> 03:32:25,840
Is he solo?

8449
03:32:26,180 --> 03:32:27,140
I think he's here.

8450
03:32:27,140 --> 03:32:28,640
I didn't see him at the bottom, too.

8451
03:32:28,820 --> 03:32:29,880
I didn't see him.

8452
03:32:29,880 --> 03:32:30,680
I didn't see him either.

8453
03:32:30,980 --> 03:32:32,120
I was like, where did he go?

8454
03:32:32,320 --> 03:32:35,280
I cracked him and then he disappeared.

8455
03:32:37,660 --> 03:32:39,340
He really disappeared.

8456
03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:43,560
Oh my god.

8457
03:32:43,580 --> 03:32:43,820
Oh my god.

8458
03:32:45,740 --> 03:32:46,220
I'm dead.

8459
03:32:46,220 --> 03:32:48,700
Oh my god, we can get Ditto to plat.

8460
03:32:49,060 --> 03:32:49,880
I believe.

8461
03:32:51,920 --> 03:32:52,660
It's okay.

8462
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:55,100
Wait, how much is it to plat?

8463
03:32:55,320 --> 03:32:57,940
I don't know, we have to leave the lobby to find out.

8464
03:32:58,140 --> 03:32:58,420
Really?

8465
03:32:58,700 --> 03:33:01,180
You can't find out in the journey.

8466
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:01,780
We're not leaving.

8467
03:33:03,960 --> 03:33:04,900
Ditto, rage quit.

8468
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:08,180
I can't see my point.

8469
03:33:08,580 --> 03:33:10,340
Yeah, Ditto, rage quit so we can see it.

8470
03:33:10,540 --> 03:33:11,840
I won't let you down.

8471
03:33:11,960 --> 03:33:12,340
Okay.

8472
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:15,260
I want to die.

8473
03:33:16,020 --> 03:33:17,440
I want to die.

8474
03:33:17,880 --> 03:33:19,040
Okay, I'm gonna go home.

8475
03:33:19,080 --> 03:33:19,680
Okay.

8476
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:26,280
Alright.

8477
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:27,460
Oh my god.

8478
03:33:27,500 --> 03:33:28,660
You know we're playing...

8479
03:33:28,660 --> 03:33:29,800
Now we're actually serious.

8480
03:33:30,420 --> 03:33:32,100
We're landing on real...

8481
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:35,100
We're landing on... for no contest.

8482
03:33:35,640 --> 03:33:36,760
I'll hit the bottom.

8483
03:33:37,700 --> 03:33:38,120
Okay.

8484
03:33:41,160 --> 03:33:42,840
I'm gonna get to the center too.

8485
03:33:44,660 --> 03:33:45,140
Nice.

8486
03:33:45,140 --> 03:33:46,480
Ooh, a purple helmet.

8487
03:33:46,900 --> 03:33:47,440
Nice gun.

8488
03:33:47,740 --> 03:33:48,380
Nice gun.

8489
03:33:48,460 --> 03:33:48,960
Nice gun.

8490
03:33:49,660 --> 03:33:50,140
Okay.

8491
03:33:52,320 --> 03:33:53,560
What is the center?

8492
03:33:53,780 --> 03:33:55,600
What do you have in the center?

8493
03:33:56,520 --> 03:33:58,320
How did I die last time?

8494
03:33:58,440 --> 03:33:59,920
Oh, I got shot while...

8495
03:34:00,500 --> 03:34:02,000
using a jump tower.

8496
03:34:02,260 --> 03:34:02,500
Yeah.

8497
03:34:03,140 --> 03:34:04,040
Yeah, you did.

8498
03:34:04,140 --> 03:34:04,920
You were the last...

8499
03:34:04,920 --> 03:34:06,980
There was like a full team that shot you down.

8500
03:34:07,400 --> 03:34:08,740
And we watched it happen.

8501
03:34:09,280 --> 03:34:09,980
That was crazy.

8502
03:34:11,060 --> 03:34:11,540
Yeah.

8503
03:34:11,540 --> 03:34:12,660
It was so sad.

8504
03:34:13,580 --> 03:34:14,340
I just...

8505
03:34:14,340 --> 03:34:16,900
I watched you die in front of me and then I died too.

8506
03:34:17,540 --> 03:34:18,740
Well, I think...

8507
03:34:18,740 --> 03:34:20,260
Why did you die?

8508
03:34:20,600 --> 03:34:22,880
Because there was two teams.

8509
03:34:23,460 --> 03:34:25,320
Because the other team...

8510
03:34:25,320 --> 03:34:27,420
looked at me and I died.

8511
03:34:27,540 --> 03:34:28,300
There's a Havoc here.

8512
03:34:28,520 --> 03:34:29,220
Do you want it?

8513
03:34:29,740 --> 03:34:30,260
No.

8514
03:34:30,700 --> 03:34:31,220
No?

8515
03:34:31,280 --> 03:34:32,580
You don't want the Havoc?

8516
03:34:32,720 --> 03:34:32,860
No.

8517
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:34,200
Damn.

8518
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:35,740
I'll take the Havoc then.

8519
03:34:36,820 --> 03:34:38,160
Havoc is for the weak.

8520
03:34:39,300 --> 03:34:40,860
Havoc is for the weak?

8521
03:34:41,540 --> 03:34:42,680
I'll remember that.

8522
03:34:42,840 --> 03:34:45,620
If I see you ever use the Havoc again...

8523
03:34:46,300 --> 03:34:46,760
Yeah?

8524
03:34:47,160 --> 03:34:48,280
Yeah, I'm the weak.

8525
03:34:48,380 --> 03:34:49,100
I'm weak.

8526
03:34:50,400 --> 03:34:51,740
There's two teams in Syphon.

8527
03:34:51,960 --> 03:34:53,940
If we want a third party... Holy shit!

8528
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:54,780
Look at Lodge site.

8529
03:34:55,280 --> 03:34:56,640
Wait, is there one person there?

8530
03:34:56,760 --> 03:34:57,220
What is that?

8531
03:34:57,960 --> 03:34:59,180
That's one person, isn't it?

8532
03:34:59,380 --> 03:35:01,500
Yeah, there's one person at staging.

8533
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:03,720
Staging, staging.

8534
03:35:04,100 --> 03:35:08,160
Yeah, because their teammate is at Mirage.

8535
03:35:08,200 --> 03:35:08,460
Okay.

8536
03:35:08,980 --> 03:35:09,540
That's why.

8537
03:35:09,540 --> 03:35:13,380
I will go get Irohazard and Scandering.

8538
03:35:13,680 --> 03:35:14,240
Okay.

8539
03:35:15,700 --> 03:35:16,260
Woo!

8540
03:35:19,080 --> 03:35:20,460
Okay, we have to play the zone.

8541
03:35:21,360 --> 03:35:21,920
Alright.

8542
03:35:22,000 --> 03:35:23,760
Oh my god, we're playing zone, guys.

8543
03:35:24,000 --> 03:35:25,080
Yeah, we're playing zone.

8544
03:35:26,220 --> 03:35:28,500
Girl squad is trying now.

8545
03:35:30,840 --> 03:35:31,400
Alright.

8546
03:35:35,160 --> 03:35:36,240
Where's the zone?

8547
03:35:36,240 --> 03:35:36,520
Oh, little.

8548
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:38,860
Okay, I'm scanning.

8549
03:35:40,580 --> 03:35:42,560
I'm gonna grab the health chest.

8550
03:35:43,060 --> 03:35:43,600
It's probably...

8551
03:35:43,600 --> 03:35:44,000
Kaotao?

8552
03:35:44,220 --> 03:35:45,280
Maybe Kaotao?

8553
03:35:45,420 --> 03:35:45,700
No!

8554
03:35:45,820 --> 03:35:46,640
What is this?

8555
03:35:46,640 --> 03:35:47,300
Oh, this frag.

8556
03:35:47,420 --> 03:35:48,240
Oh my god.

8557
03:35:48,620 --> 03:35:49,500
There's no one.

8558
03:35:49,500 --> 03:35:49,800
No.

8559
03:35:50,700 --> 03:35:52,420
Alright, guess we're going to frag.

8560
03:35:52,440 --> 03:35:53,340
Should we go through the tunnel?

8561
03:35:54,900 --> 03:35:55,760
Yeah, yeah.

8562
03:35:55,840 --> 03:35:57,140
I think we can go.

8563
03:35:57,260 --> 03:35:57,600
Yeah.

8564
03:35:57,840 --> 03:35:58,280
Yeah.

8565
03:35:58,280 --> 03:35:58,520
Okay.

8566
03:35:58,520 --> 03:36:01,020
Alright, I'm heading over.

8567
03:36:02,420 --> 03:36:04,340
Lifeline is heading over.

8568
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:06,200
Wee!

8569
03:36:08,900 --> 03:36:10,040
Here I come.

8570
03:36:12,500 --> 03:36:13,420
I need a skill.

8571
03:36:13,520 --> 03:36:13,920
Oh my gosh.

8572
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:14,240
Hurry up, Lifeline.

8573
03:36:14,460 --> 03:36:14,960
Hurry up.

8574
03:36:15,600 --> 03:36:16,560
I'm Lifeline!

8575
03:36:17,220 --> 03:36:19,000
I don't have any mobility.

8576
03:36:20,560 --> 03:36:21,600
But Kaeptoe.

8577
03:36:21,740 --> 03:36:25,840
Kaeptoe doesn't have any ability, too.

8578
03:36:26,280 --> 03:36:28,180
Well, actually he does.

8579
03:36:28,240 --> 03:36:29,500
I think when he level out.

8580
03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:33,340
Like, if his drone gets destroyed, he moves faster.

8581
03:36:33,620 --> 03:36:34,040
Yeah, see?

8582
03:36:34,380 --> 03:36:34,600
Really?

8583
03:36:34,860 --> 03:36:35,620
Lifeline has nothing.

8584
03:36:35,620 --> 03:36:36,220
Yeah, he's like, I'm going to go.

8585
03:36:36,240 --> 03:36:37,700
It actually does.

8586
03:36:37,880 --> 03:36:43,220
There's an upgrade where your drone time is like, faster and also you get like a speed boost.

8587
03:36:43,620 --> 03:36:45,260
I didn't even believe you.

8588
03:36:45,320 --> 03:36:46,080
She was like, really?

8589
03:36:46,780 --> 03:36:47,300
Really?

8590
03:36:49,320 --> 03:36:50,740
I can't believe it.

8591
03:36:51,180 --> 03:36:52,700
This sounds like a lie.

8592
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:54,740
Oh, you're trying to say...

8593
03:36:55,300 --> 03:36:58,440
Are you trying to say that Hiro would lie to you?

8594
03:36:58,540 --> 03:36:59,260
That's fucked up.

8595
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:01,700
Oh, no, no, no.

8596
03:37:02,220 --> 03:37:05,460
I can't believe you would think that Hiro would lie to you like that.

8597
03:37:05,540 --> 03:37:05,900
I can't believe you would think that Hiro would lie to you like that.

8598
03:37:06,380 --> 03:37:08,120
Is this faster?

8599
03:37:10,340 --> 03:37:10,820
Yeah.

8600
03:37:13,020 --> 03:37:14,620
Your first time knowing it, huh?

8601
03:37:15,300 --> 03:37:16,660
Yeah, she doesn't play crypto.

8602
03:37:16,660 --> 03:37:17,820
How did you know that?

8603
03:37:17,880 --> 03:37:18,680
How did you know that?

8604
03:37:18,720 --> 03:37:20,120
Because I level it out.

8605
03:37:21,940 --> 03:37:24,120
Yeah, Hiro, how do you know?

8606
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:27,060
I'm playing crypto.

8607
03:37:28,340 --> 03:37:32,140
It's not like you played crypto for four hours now.

8608
03:37:32,880 --> 03:37:33,720
Oh, my God.

8609
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:34,540
It's been four hours.

8610
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:35,520
Yeah, it's been four hours.

8611
03:37:35,580 --> 03:37:35,880
I'm playing crypto.

8612
03:37:35,880 --> 03:37:36,620
Alright.

8613
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:38,820
Let's go to... when you go to Frag.

8614
03:37:39,460 --> 03:37:39,940
Okay.

8615
03:37:40,940 --> 03:37:42,500
I want Carbine.

8616
03:37:43,720 --> 03:37:44,200
No.

8617
03:37:44,440 --> 03:37:45,880
Because I have Carbine.

8618
03:37:46,140 --> 03:37:47,160
No Carbine for you.

8619
03:37:47,940 --> 03:37:49,600
Okay, I want to go grab that too.

8620
03:37:49,860 --> 03:37:51,420
Yeah, we got to get that.

8621
03:37:52,980 --> 03:37:54,500
Okay, turn... turn...

8622
03:37:54,500 --> 03:37:55,360
Yeah.

8623
03:37:57,140 --> 03:37:57,460
Get back.

8624
03:37:59,100 --> 03:37:59,880
Oh, I got one.

8625
03:37:59,980 --> 03:38:00,320
Oh, wait, no.

8626
03:38:00,380 --> 03:38:01,000
I should get that.

8627
03:38:01,840 --> 03:38:03,660
I can take the heat shield.

8628
03:38:03,920 --> 03:38:04,400
Oh, okay.

8629
03:38:05,880 --> 03:38:06,460
Yeah, you can take it.

8630
03:38:06,580 --> 03:38:07,020
Okay.

8631
03:38:09,580 --> 03:38:11,000
Now we have to...

8632
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:12,260
We have to think now.

8633
03:38:12,600 --> 03:38:13,660
We got to use our brains.

8634
03:38:13,860 --> 03:38:14,300
Okay.

8635
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:16,740
We have to use our brains.

8636
03:38:17,780 --> 03:38:19,780
I'm going to be throwing my drone out constantly.

8637
03:38:20,560 --> 03:38:23,360
If we get a house, we can just chill.

8638
03:38:23,540 --> 03:38:24,560
Yeah, we have... yeah.

8639
03:38:25,440 --> 03:38:27,100
I think we should...

8640
03:38:27,780 --> 03:38:28,600
Which house?

8641
03:38:29,240 --> 03:38:29,940
Which house?

8642
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:30,760
Which is a good house?

8643
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:31,820
IGL, which house?

8644
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:34,740
I pay for this.

8645
03:38:35,880 --> 03:38:36,120
This house?

8646
03:38:36,260 --> 03:38:36,560
Alright.

8647
03:38:38,200 --> 03:38:38,820
That house.

8648
03:38:39,240 --> 03:38:39,760
This house.

8649
03:38:39,940 --> 03:38:40,080
Okay.

8650
03:38:40,500 --> 03:38:42,860
There's a lot of angles to take care of though.

8651
03:38:42,960 --> 03:38:43,280
Oh, no.

8652
03:38:43,360 --> 03:38:44,240
It's inside the lane.

8653
03:38:44,380 --> 03:38:44,620
Oh, yeah.

8654
03:38:44,720 --> 03:38:45,660
It's inside the lane.

8655
03:38:46,040 --> 03:38:46,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8656
03:38:47,140 --> 03:38:50,360
We could try this house, right?

8657
03:38:51,140 --> 03:38:51,580
Yeah.

8658
03:38:51,760 --> 03:38:54,400
Yeah, I feel like this house is better than this house.

8659
03:38:54,460 --> 03:38:55,460
This house has too many angles.

8660
03:38:56,540 --> 03:38:58,520
Yeah, that house is not good.

8661
03:38:59,340 --> 03:38:59,780
Yeah.

8662
03:39:00,120 --> 03:39:01,000
Wait, there's one team?

8663
03:39:01,900 --> 03:39:03,440
Well, let's see if they're in this house.

8664
03:39:05,260 --> 03:39:06,300
They're really far.

8665
03:39:06,420 --> 03:39:06,940
They're scanning.

8666
03:39:07,500 --> 03:39:07,760
Oh, yeah.

8667
03:39:08,460 --> 03:39:09,100
They're scanning this.

8668
03:39:09,100 --> 03:39:10,140
There's a bat here.

8669
03:39:11,100 --> 03:39:12,720
Let's see if I remember how to climb this.

8670
03:39:13,420 --> 03:39:15,520
Okay, go this house and...

8671
03:39:15,520 --> 03:39:16,500
Wait, did they change this?

8672
03:39:17,400 --> 03:39:18,480
They changed it.

8673
03:39:18,600 --> 03:39:19,080
Did they?

8674
03:39:19,820 --> 03:39:20,260
Yeah.

8675
03:39:20,440 --> 03:39:21,600
You used to be able to climb this.

8676
03:39:21,860 --> 03:39:22,500
Can you still do it?

8677
03:39:22,980 --> 03:39:24,840
You can climb here, you know, Doki.

8678
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:25,720
Like here.

8679
03:39:26,640 --> 03:39:27,340
Oh, shit.

8680
03:39:27,480 --> 03:39:28,360
There's no cause.

8681
03:39:28,500 --> 03:39:29,060
There's no cause.

8682
03:39:29,240 --> 03:39:29,260
Oh, shit.

8683
03:39:29,260 --> 03:39:29,900
Okay, I'm coming back.

8684
03:39:30,420 --> 03:39:31,580
The purple armor.

8685
03:39:31,860 --> 03:39:33,020
Where is it?

8686
03:39:33,080 --> 03:39:35,680
It's right over there.

8687
03:39:35,800 --> 03:39:37,840
Let me check.

8688
03:39:38,040 --> 03:39:39,260
Behind the bin.

8689
03:39:39,460 --> 03:39:40,500
Yeah, I got spam here.

8690
03:39:41,540 --> 03:39:42,040
91.

8691
03:39:46,560 --> 03:39:47,980
The catalyst is blue.

8692
03:39:49,780 --> 03:39:50,560
Let me check.

8693
03:39:50,720 --> 03:39:51,340
Okay, there.

8694
03:39:53,480 --> 03:39:55,060
No, not your drone.

8695
03:39:55,320 --> 03:39:55,540
It's fine.

8696
03:39:58,120 --> 03:39:59,120
Oh, careful.

8697
03:39:59,740 --> 03:40:00,580
Come here.

8698
03:40:00,960 --> 03:40:01,340
I can give you the gun.

8699
03:40:02,200 --> 03:40:02,920
I don't...

8700
03:40:02,920 --> 03:40:05,520
I think they're gonna push.

8701
03:40:06,260 --> 03:40:06,600
Okay, okay.

8702
03:40:06,760 --> 03:40:07,160
I'm looking.

8703
03:40:07,740 --> 03:40:08,380
No, they're not.

8704
03:40:08,460 --> 03:40:08,560
They're...

8705
03:40:10,640 --> 03:40:11,480
Flash, flash, flash, flash!

8706
03:40:12,640 --> 03:40:13,680
Oh, my god.

8707
03:40:13,680 --> 03:40:14,460
They're flashed.

8708
03:40:14,460 --> 03:40:15,380
The bloodhound was so low.

8709
03:40:15,580 --> 03:40:16,260
Okay, okay, okay.

8710
03:40:17,360 --> 03:40:18,360
Yeah, they're coming down here.

8711
03:40:19,160 --> 03:40:19,960
They're on me.

8712
03:40:21,680 --> 03:40:22,280
Careful, careful.

8713
03:40:22,500 --> 03:40:22,680
Grenade.

8714
03:40:22,940 --> 03:40:23,440
I'm fine.

8715
03:40:23,780 --> 03:40:24,720
I have another nade.

8716
03:40:28,020 --> 03:40:28,440
It's fine.

8717
03:40:30,060 --> 03:40:31,180
I almost had my drone back.

8718
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:32,040
I'm gonna EMP them.

8719
03:40:32,200 --> 03:40:32,600
Okay.

8720
03:40:35,200 --> 03:40:35,700
I'm looking.

8721
03:40:35,900 --> 03:40:36,000
I'm looking.

8722
03:40:36,760 --> 03:40:37,160
Okay.

8723
03:40:39,040 --> 03:40:39,820
Blue, purple.

8724
03:40:40,200 --> 03:40:40,800
Down here.

8725
03:40:40,840 --> 03:40:41,240
Okay.

8726
03:40:42,700 --> 03:40:45,120
If you're EMP, I will go for this wall.

8727
03:40:45,680 --> 03:40:46,080
Okay.

8728
03:40:48,020 --> 03:40:48,960
They might push with that.

8729
03:40:49,200 --> 03:40:49,680
I'm looking.

8730
03:40:49,840 --> 03:40:49,940
I'm looking.

8731
03:40:50,100 --> 03:40:50,520
How many seconds?

8732
03:40:52,460 --> 03:40:53,800
I don't think they're gonna...

8733
03:40:54,240 --> 03:40:55,140
Kidnapping, kidnapping, kidnapping!

8734
03:40:57,380 --> 03:40:57,780
EMPing.

8735
03:40:57,780 --> 03:40:58,220
Nice.

8736
03:40:59,680 --> 03:41:00,660
Flash, flash, flash, flash!

8737
03:41:00,680 --> 03:41:00,960
Bloodhound!

8738
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:01,760
I have to drop.

8739
03:41:01,820 --> 03:41:02,160
I have to drop.

8740
03:41:03,160 --> 03:41:03,900
I got one.

8741
03:41:04,400 --> 03:41:04,960
I got one.

8742
03:41:05,980 --> 03:41:06,520
I'm battling.

8743
03:41:06,680 --> 03:41:06,920
I'm battling.

8744
03:41:08,180 --> 03:41:08,780
I got one.

8745
03:41:08,860 --> 03:41:09,240
I'm batting.

8746
03:41:09,240 --> 03:41:09,800
I'm batting.

8747
03:41:09,840 --> 03:41:10,220
I'm coming over.

8748
03:41:10,420 --> 03:41:11,040
I dropped down.

8749
03:41:11,080 --> 03:41:11,380
I dropped down.

8750
03:41:11,400 --> 03:41:11,700
They're resing.

8751
03:41:11,700 --> 03:41:11,960
They're resing.

8752
03:41:13,580 --> 03:41:14,420
Another team here.

8753
03:41:14,500 --> 03:41:14,940
Another team.

8754
03:41:15,220 --> 03:41:16,100
I'm hitting this one.

8755
03:41:16,160 --> 03:41:16,540
They don't...

8756
03:41:17,100 --> 03:41:17,420
Okay.

8757
03:41:17,560 --> 03:41:18,080
I'm going.

8758
03:41:18,120 --> 03:41:18,340
Okay.

8759
03:41:18,860 --> 03:41:19,460
Down, down, down.

8760
03:41:20,780 --> 03:41:21,240
Bloodhound low.

8761
03:41:21,260 --> 03:41:21,640
Bloodhound low.

8762
03:41:22,720 --> 03:41:23,360
Another team.

8763
03:41:23,480 --> 03:41:23,800
Ducky.

8764
03:41:23,920 --> 03:41:24,280
Another team.

8765
03:41:24,760 --> 03:41:25,620
I have to go.

8766
03:41:25,800 --> 03:41:26,080
I have to go.

8767
03:41:26,600 --> 03:41:27,380
I will go.

8768
03:41:27,500 --> 03:41:28,220
Oh, I'm dead here.

8769
03:41:28,260 --> 03:41:28,620
I'm dead dead.

8770
03:41:29,580 --> 03:41:30,000
I'm going.

8771
03:41:30,240 --> 03:41:30,880
I will run.

8772
03:41:30,880 --> 03:41:31,240
I will run.

8773
03:41:31,240 --> 03:41:31,640
Just run.

8774
03:41:31,780 --> 03:41:32,000
Just run.

8775
03:41:32,100 --> 03:41:32,300
Just run.

8776
03:41:34,440 --> 03:41:34,760
Just run.

8777
03:41:34,900 --> 03:41:35,560
Yeah, just run.

8778
03:41:35,560 --> 03:41:35,720
Just run.

8779
03:41:35,920 --> 03:41:36,520
Full team.

8780
03:41:36,540 --> 03:41:36,860
Full team.

8781
03:41:36,880 --> 03:41:37,080
Full team.

8782
03:41:37,160 --> 03:41:37,220
Mommy.

8783
03:41:37,540 --> 03:41:38,020
Just run.

8784
03:41:38,060 --> 03:41:38,300
Just run.

8785
03:41:38,400 --> 03:41:38,620
Okay.

8786
03:41:38,680 --> 03:41:39,000
Okay.

8787
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:39,180
Okay.

8788
03:41:41,380 --> 03:41:41,840
It's fine.

8789
03:41:41,900 --> 03:41:43,380
They also have one solo left.

8790
03:41:43,880 --> 03:41:44,200
Yeah.

8791
03:41:44,260 --> 03:41:44,560
Okay.

8792
03:41:44,680 --> 03:41:45,340
You can leave.

8793
03:41:45,640 --> 03:41:46,040
Don't worry.

8794
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:46,440
Yeah, just leave.

8795
03:41:46,480 --> 03:41:46,720
Just leave.

8796
03:41:46,740 --> 03:41:47,020
Just leave.

8797
03:41:47,680 --> 03:41:48,720
Yeah, and craft this.

8798
03:41:49,820 --> 03:41:50,140
Yeah.

8799
03:41:51,900 --> 03:41:53,780
Let's like... You got 30.

8800
03:41:54,800 --> 03:41:55,800
That's what they get.

8801
03:41:56,200 --> 03:41:58,880
I'm like, why would you fucking flirt us?

8802
03:41:59,640 --> 03:42:01,140
Why did they push?

8803
03:42:01,240 --> 03:42:02,220
Yeah, why did they push?

8804
03:42:02,900 --> 03:42:03,720
You stupid?

8805
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:08,680
This is why you're gonna stay in gold forever.

8806
03:42:10,900 --> 03:42:13,780
This is why you'll never get back to MasterChef.

8807
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:16,980
There's no crafter here too.

8808
03:42:17,240 --> 03:42:17,620
Is there?

8809
03:42:17,820 --> 03:42:18,980
You have to go all the way.

8810
03:42:20,240 --> 03:42:20,760
Yeah.

8811
03:42:20,760 --> 03:42:22,420
Why would they push us?

8812
03:42:24,280 --> 03:42:24,520
I don't know.

8813
03:42:24,640 --> 03:42:25,160
I don't know.

8814
03:42:26,300 --> 03:42:27,340
They're so stupid.

8815
03:42:28,580 --> 03:42:29,780
I believe in ditto.

8816
03:42:30,560 --> 03:42:31,360
Oh my god.

8817
03:42:31,460 --> 03:42:32,380
Just go through it.

8818
03:42:33,020 --> 03:42:33,480
Oh, there.

8819
03:42:40,820 --> 03:42:41,900
Where are they going?

8820
03:42:42,240 --> 03:42:43,100
They're on top.

8821
03:42:43,260 --> 03:42:44,280
They're getting stuff.

8822
03:42:44,620 --> 03:42:44,820
Yeah.

8823
03:42:45,500 --> 03:42:46,180
Where are they?

8824
03:42:46,300 --> 03:42:47,580
Oh, they're getting shot at.

8825
03:42:55,750 --> 03:42:56,170
What?

8826
03:42:56,170 --> 03:42:57,190
What are they doing?

8827
03:42:57,330 --> 03:42:58,550
I'm so confused.

8828
03:42:58,690 --> 03:42:59,990
Why are they here?

8829
03:43:00,390 --> 03:43:01,270
Why are they here?

8830
03:43:01,850 --> 03:43:03,590
Are they gonna try and sneak away?

8831
03:43:05,390 --> 03:43:08,530
Yeah, but now she needs to find a way to get a crafter.

8832
03:43:09,130 --> 03:43:12,790
I don't think there's... unless a crafter drops next to her.

8833
03:43:14,050 --> 03:43:16,810
There's literally zero crafters.

8834
03:43:16,810 --> 03:43:17,390
Holy shit.

8835
03:43:18,210 --> 03:43:18,770
Yeah.

8836
03:43:19,270 --> 03:43:19,830
Oh!

8837
03:43:20,030 --> 03:43:20,470
What the heck?

8838
03:43:20,510 --> 03:43:21,410
What the fuck?

8839
03:43:21,410 --> 03:43:22,450
What the fuck?

8840
03:43:22,690 --> 03:43:24,270
How can they... Oh!

8841
03:43:25,210 --> 03:43:26,950
Where did they come from?

8842
03:43:27,690 --> 03:43:30,550
I feel like they were fighting me.

8843
03:43:30,950 --> 03:43:31,390
Yeah.

8844
03:43:32,090 --> 03:43:32,530
What?

8845
03:43:32,730 --> 03:43:34,290
Where did they come from?

8846
03:43:36,010 --> 03:43:37,110
Wait, this is a duo.

8847
03:43:38,550 --> 03:43:39,750
Wait, there was a team here.

8848
03:43:39,750 --> 03:43:40,270
I got shot.

8849
03:43:40,410 --> 03:43:42,050
This isn't a team.

8850
03:43:42,210 --> 03:43:42,390
Yeah.

8851
03:43:42,410 --> 03:43:44,030
This isn't a team.

8852
03:43:44,310 --> 03:43:44,490
Yeah.

8853
03:43:44,590 --> 03:43:45,350
This is another team.

8854
03:43:45,910 --> 03:43:46,970
Where did they come?

8855
03:43:47,150 --> 03:43:47,690
They were hiding.

8856
03:43:47,770 --> 03:43:50,110
They were ratting here this entire time.

8857
03:43:50,290 --> 03:43:51,150
Holy shit.

8858
03:43:54,370 --> 03:43:55,550
Oh my god.

8859
03:43:55,710 --> 03:43:56,830
They were ratting.

8860
03:44:00,030 --> 03:44:00,670
Oh my god.

8861
03:44:00,670 --> 03:44:00,670
They were ratting.

8862
03:44:00,730 --> 03:44:05,970
That stupid team that rushed us for no reason.

8863
03:44:06,890 --> 03:44:07,530
Yeah.

8864
03:44:07,630 --> 03:44:09,390
They rushed us just to die.

8865
03:44:11,030 --> 03:44:12,830
Did they eliminate it?

8866
03:44:13,070 --> 03:44:13,850
Yeah, they died.

8867
03:44:13,990 --> 03:44:14,970
I'm pretty sure they got eliminated.

8868
03:44:15,350 --> 03:44:15,350
Yeah.

8869
03:44:15,770 --> 03:44:18,070
The one that first pushed us.

8870
03:44:18,230 --> 03:44:18,450
Yeah.

8871
03:44:19,230 --> 03:44:20,450
They got eliminated.

8872
03:44:20,810 --> 03:44:21,930
They're so stupid.

8873
03:44:22,250 --> 03:44:24,810
They literally died just to kill us.

8874
03:44:24,930 --> 03:44:25,950
They literally died just to kill us.

8875
03:44:28,420 --> 03:44:28,500
Yeah.

8876
03:44:28,500 --> 03:44:29,340
It's not stream snipers.

8877
03:44:29,360 --> 03:44:31,040
It's people being really stupid in rank.

8878
03:44:33,200 --> 03:44:36,520
It was separates like good players with unga bunga players.

8879
03:44:40,870 --> 03:44:42,890
Oh, the other team did BM though.

8880
03:44:44,210 --> 03:44:44,810
Oh, wait.

8881
03:44:44,890 --> 03:44:45,550
What BM?

8882
03:44:45,990 --> 03:44:46,470
Yeah.

8883
03:44:46,510 --> 03:44:48,850
The other one that killed us after.

8884
03:44:49,050 --> 03:44:49,310
Yeah.

8885
03:44:49,450 --> 03:44:50,210
Oh, did they?

8886
03:44:50,310 --> 03:44:50,570
Yeah.

8887
03:44:51,190 --> 03:44:52,090
I didn't realize.

8888
03:44:53,910 --> 03:44:55,410
They just like insta-killed me.

8889
03:44:55,550 --> 03:44:55,790
I understand.

8890
03:44:56,530 --> 03:44:58,170
They didn't insta-kill me.

8891
03:44:58,170 --> 03:44:58,850
I was like, oh.

8892
03:44:58,990 --> 03:44:59,970
Oh, they didn't insta-kill you.

8893
03:45:00,110 --> 03:45:01,130
Oh, they insta-killed me.

8894
03:45:02,290 --> 03:45:02,610
Yeah.

8895
03:45:03,430 --> 03:45:03,750
Alright.

8896
03:45:05,170 --> 03:45:06,090
One team maybe.

8897
03:45:06,110 --> 03:45:06,370
One team?

8898
03:45:06,530 --> 03:45:06,710
Okay.

8899
03:45:07,870 --> 03:45:08,710
Yeah, one team.

8900
03:45:08,950 --> 03:45:09,530
Where are they landing?

8901
03:45:09,730 --> 03:45:10,050
Okay.

8902
03:45:10,510 --> 03:45:11,910
I see a... We can go together.

8903
03:45:12,970 --> 03:45:13,290
Okay.

8904
03:45:13,550 --> 03:45:14,470
I'm looting the bottom.

8905
03:45:14,510 --> 03:45:15,310
They might land on left.

8906
03:45:16,390 --> 03:45:17,710
Okay, I'll go with Ditto.

8907
03:45:18,730 --> 03:45:19,050
Okay.

8908
03:45:20,490 --> 03:45:21,370
Oh, they went center.

8909
03:45:21,430 --> 03:45:21,810
They went center.

8910
03:45:21,810 --> 03:45:22,050
They're on me.

8911
03:45:22,130 --> 03:45:22,430
They're on me.

8912
03:45:22,750 --> 03:45:23,070
Okay.

8913
03:45:23,930 --> 03:45:24,250
Okay.

8914
03:45:26,450 --> 03:45:26,770
Okay.

8915
03:45:26,970 --> 03:45:27,090
Inside.

8916
03:45:27,230 --> 03:45:27,370
Inside.

8917
03:45:27,910 --> 03:45:28,230
Okay.

8918
03:45:28,570 --> 03:45:28,890
Coming.

8919
03:45:31,110 --> 03:45:31,910
Oh, two teams!

8920
03:45:32,010 --> 03:45:32,230
Two teams!

8921
03:45:32,270 --> 03:45:32,550
Two teams!

8922
03:45:32,590 --> 03:45:32,810
Two teams!

8923
03:45:32,910 --> 03:45:33,350
I'm backing out!

8924
03:45:33,450 --> 03:45:33,970
I'm backing out!

8925
03:45:34,050 --> 03:45:34,390
I'm backing out!

8926
03:45:34,470 --> 03:45:34,990
Wait, wait, wait.

8927
03:45:35,050 --> 03:45:35,410
I'm backing out.

8928
03:45:35,490 --> 03:45:35,770
There's two.

8929
03:45:35,850 --> 03:45:36,070
There's two.

8930
03:45:36,070 --> 03:45:36,250
There's two.

8931
03:45:36,550 --> 03:45:37,330
Oh my god.

8932
03:45:37,470 --> 03:45:39,830
Yeah, I'm backing out to loot more.

8933
03:45:40,070 --> 03:45:40,750
There's three!

8934
03:45:41,010 --> 03:45:41,590
There's three!

8935
03:45:42,170 --> 03:45:43,070
What the heck?

8936
03:45:43,270 --> 03:45:44,410
Why are you here?

8937
03:45:44,590 --> 03:45:46,010
This is shitty loot.

8938
03:45:47,730 --> 03:45:49,190
I think we go Harvester.

8939
03:45:50,090 --> 03:45:50,950
We are Harvester.

8940
03:45:51,950 --> 03:45:52,130
I don't know.

8941
03:45:52,130 --> 03:45:53,750
I mean, I love Slytherin.

8942
03:45:55,570 --> 03:45:56,770
I mean, I love Slytherin.

8943
03:45:58,170 --> 03:45:58,810
Why three?

8944
03:45:59,450 --> 03:46:00,330
What the heck?

8945
03:46:00,590 --> 03:46:01,850
Yeah, what are they doing here?

8946
03:46:03,410 --> 03:46:03,850
What?

8947
03:46:04,570 --> 03:46:05,010
Why?

8948
03:46:05,130 --> 03:46:05,370
What?

8949
03:46:06,030 --> 03:46:07,030
Why are you saying three?

8950
03:46:07,030 --> 03:46:07,590
What do they want?

8951
03:46:07,710 --> 03:46:08,030
Yeah.

8952
03:46:09,630 --> 03:46:10,690
What do they want?

8953
03:46:10,770 --> 03:46:12,610
I thought it was like one team, but then like...

8954
03:46:12,610 --> 03:46:15,070
Yeah, and then another team landed on the other side.

8955
03:46:15,310 --> 03:46:15,750
Yeah, yeah.

8956
03:46:15,750 --> 03:46:18,770
I'm like, this is not... there's not enough loot for three.

8957
03:46:18,770 --> 03:46:18,770
There's not enough loot for three.

8958
03:46:18,790 --> 03:46:19,250
There will be three on me.

8959
03:46:20,650 --> 03:46:22,370
There's not even enough loot for this.

8960
03:46:22,430 --> 03:46:23,030
I'm okay here.

8961
03:46:23,990 --> 03:46:24,870
Yeah, if...

8962
03:46:24,870 --> 03:46:25,870
If we...

8963
03:46:25,870 --> 03:46:29,010
If we won, we didn't have a lot.

8964
03:46:29,470 --> 03:46:30,610
Yeah, we lived.

8965
03:46:31,370 --> 03:46:32,430
That's all that matters.

8966
03:46:32,670 --> 03:46:33,530
We lived.

8967
03:46:33,890 --> 03:46:34,410
Whoa!

8968
03:46:34,730 --> 03:46:35,210
Whoa!

8969
03:46:35,930 --> 03:46:37,390
The server lagged for me.

8970
03:46:37,450 --> 03:46:38,210
Did it lag for you guys?

8971
03:46:39,390 --> 03:46:39,910
No.

8972
03:46:40,030 --> 03:46:41,030
Oh my god.

8973
03:46:41,150 --> 03:46:43,090
I have all the signs right now.

8974
03:46:43,550 --> 03:46:44,850
Oh, they're supposed to be here.

8975
03:46:44,990 --> 03:46:47,170
Oh, it might be a bit laggy.

8976
03:46:47,290 --> 03:46:49,210
Yeah, I have all the signs.

8977
03:46:50,070 --> 03:46:51,230
It's coming here.

8978
03:46:52,950 --> 03:46:54,250
Alright, I'm coming over to you.

8979
03:46:55,390 --> 03:46:56,150
I'm okay.

8980
03:46:56,850 --> 03:46:59,170
There's people here in Lava Siphon, by the way.

8981
03:47:00,090 --> 03:47:00,610
Okay.

8982
03:47:00,770 --> 03:47:02,830
I saw like the middle was looted.

8983
03:47:04,330 --> 03:47:05,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8984
03:47:05,650 --> 03:47:06,670
Yeah, I saw it.

8985
03:47:08,270 --> 03:47:08,790
Whee!

8986
03:47:10,050 --> 03:47:11,050
Oh no!

8987
03:47:11,190 --> 03:47:11,810
Oh no!

8988
03:47:12,470 --> 03:47:12,990
Oh!

8989
03:47:13,470 --> 03:47:16,090
The server lagged.

8990
03:47:16,110 --> 03:47:17,530
You just stopped moving.

8991
03:47:17,870 --> 03:47:21,010
I saw you were in place, so I knew I was lagging.

8992
03:47:21,230 --> 03:47:22,350
You got... you got...

8993
03:47:22,730 --> 03:47:23,870
package loss.

8994
03:47:24,870 --> 03:47:26,090
I'm looting everything right now.

8995
03:47:26,250 --> 03:47:27,110
Okay, okay.

8996
03:47:28,090 --> 03:47:29,130
Oh, it disappeared.

8997
03:47:29,330 --> 03:47:29,550
It disappeared.

8998
03:47:30,170 --> 03:47:31,030
I think I'm okay.

8999
03:47:31,450 --> 03:47:32,250
I'm okay now.

9000
03:47:32,450 --> 03:47:33,570
Oh, it's looted here too.

9001
03:47:33,890 --> 03:47:34,390
Yeah, yeah.

9002
03:47:34,950 --> 03:47:35,750
I'm with Hiro.

9003
03:47:35,870 --> 03:47:36,450
It's looted here.

9004
03:47:36,590 --> 03:47:38,790
Okay, I'll go to heal.

9005
03:47:39,930 --> 03:47:40,750
Maybe guys...

9006
03:47:40,750 --> 03:47:42,770
Maybe we can... we can loot guys.

9007
03:47:42,850 --> 03:47:43,590
Yeah, we need...

9008
03:47:43,590 --> 03:47:45,990
Let's get that Evo Harvester up the hill though.

9009
03:47:46,110 --> 03:47:46,830
I feel like...

9010
03:47:47,290 --> 03:47:48,410
I'll go get it, sure.

9011
03:47:48,930 --> 03:47:51,130
I can check if there's anybody.

9012
03:47:51,130 --> 03:47:53,250
Oh, it's lagging for me too.

9013
03:47:53,250 --> 03:47:53,710
It's lagging.

9014
03:47:53,930 --> 03:47:54,350
It's lagging.

9015
03:47:54,970 --> 03:47:56,590
Okay, I'm not crazy then.

9016
03:47:57,690 --> 03:47:58,650
That's good to know.

9017
03:48:00,730 --> 03:48:03,730
Oh, there's a team that just flew...

9018
03:48:03,730 --> 03:48:04,010
Oh, there's a team that just flew...

9019
03:48:04,010 --> 03:48:04,770
Where did they fly to?

9020
03:48:05,330 --> 03:48:06,070
I don't know.

9021
03:48:06,130 --> 03:48:07,070
They flew like here.

9022
03:48:12,200 --> 03:48:12,620
Alright.

9023
03:48:12,760 --> 03:48:12,920
Wait.

9024
03:48:13,240 --> 03:48:14,640
That's really dangerous.

9025
03:48:15,740 --> 03:48:16,420
I'm with you?

9026
03:48:17,240 --> 03:48:17,660
Yeah.

9027
03:48:18,340 --> 03:48:19,200
I'm looking for you.

9028
03:48:19,240 --> 03:48:19,660
I'm looking for you.

9029
03:48:19,780 --> 03:48:21,660
Yeah, they jumped Howard.

9030
03:48:21,660 --> 03:48:22,600
Whew.

9031
03:48:24,100 --> 03:48:25,120
I'm gonna loot this.

9032
03:48:25,400 --> 03:48:27,040
Yeah, we need that Evo.

9033
03:48:27,140 --> 03:48:28,680
We need that blue armor.

9034
03:48:28,960 --> 03:48:30,440
We can go here, I think.

9035
03:48:30,600 --> 03:48:32,460
Can you scan here?

9036
03:48:33,000 --> 03:48:33,680
Okay, okay.

9037
03:48:34,280 --> 03:48:35,160
Scan the beacon.

9038
03:48:36,340 --> 03:48:37,940
I think we can loot here.

9039
03:48:38,580 --> 03:48:39,300
Yeah, we can.

9040
03:48:39,640 --> 03:48:40,720
I'm pretty sure nobody looted this.

9041
03:48:40,720 --> 03:48:41,040
Be careful.

9042
03:48:41,200 --> 03:48:41,340
Be careful.

9043
03:48:41,520 --> 03:48:44,600
There might be another team come from...

9044
03:48:45,340 --> 03:48:47,180
Yeah, it could be.

9045
03:48:47,280 --> 03:48:47,800
It's not looted.

9046
03:48:47,880 --> 03:48:48,880
I'm looking at it now.

9047
03:48:49,600 --> 03:48:50,600
Yeah, it's not looted.

9048
03:48:51,660 --> 03:48:53,140
Yeah, they jumped from that place.

9049
03:48:53,720 --> 03:48:54,680
I'm gonna...

9050
03:48:55,380 --> 03:48:56,400
I'm putting my Evo...

9051
03:48:56,400 --> 03:48:57,520
Wait, there's one guy.

9052
03:48:57,860 --> 03:49:00,960
Be careful here too.

9053
03:49:03,880 --> 03:49:04,940
His team is there.

9054
03:49:05,200 --> 03:49:05,840
His team is there.

9055
03:49:06,980 --> 03:49:08,000
On the tunnel?

9056
03:49:08,220 --> 03:49:09,320
Two people?

9057
03:49:09,760 --> 03:49:10,240
Yeah.

9058
03:49:10,240 --> 03:49:11,560
Oh, there's Blade.

9059
03:49:11,920 --> 03:49:15,620
One there and two in the tunnel.

9060
03:49:16,740 --> 03:49:17,340
Yeah.

9061
03:49:17,360 --> 03:49:18,360
Where's his team then?

9062
03:49:19,540 --> 03:49:21,000
No, it's still... Yeah.

9063
03:49:24,140 --> 03:49:24,540
No.

9064
03:49:25,120 --> 03:49:25,520
No.

9065
03:49:25,520 --> 03:49:27,280
Should we... No, there's three there, I think.

9066
03:49:27,520 --> 03:49:28,860
I think maybe they're super close.

9067
03:49:29,640 --> 03:49:31,480
I think they'll head to us, right?

9068
03:49:31,700 --> 03:49:32,500
Or they're gonna go around.

9069
03:49:33,540 --> 03:49:35,680
They might go around since you scanned them all.

9070
03:49:36,980 --> 03:49:37,380
Yeah.

9071
03:49:37,380 --> 03:49:39,900
We could just go... We can just go head to zone now.

9072
03:49:40,500 --> 03:49:40,900
Okay.

9073
03:49:41,220 --> 03:49:43,220
Yeah, cause there's too many teams behind.

9074
03:49:43,320 --> 03:49:43,460
Do you have battery?

9075
03:49:43,460 --> 03:49:44,340
There's 16 teams still.

9076
03:49:44,440 --> 03:49:44,960
I have two.

9077
03:49:45,020 --> 03:49:45,480
I have two.

9078
03:49:45,480 --> 03:49:45,740
I have three.

9079
03:49:46,120 --> 03:49:46,800
I have zero.

9080
03:49:47,260 --> 03:49:47,820
I have three bats.

9081
03:49:47,860 --> 03:49:48,620
I can give Hiro one.

9082
03:49:48,620 --> 03:49:49,320
Okay.

9083
03:49:49,560 --> 03:49:49,860
Okay.

9084
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:50,740
Here you go.

9085
03:49:51,260 --> 03:49:52,040
Thank you.

9086
03:49:52,620 --> 03:49:53,140
Yeah!

9087
03:49:55,760 --> 03:49:56,280
Okay.

9088
03:49:56,380 --> 03:49:56,900
Okay.

9089
03:49:57,660 --> 03:49:58,180
There's...

9090
03:49:58,180 --> 03:49:59,820
There's one team in Monument.

9091
03:50:00,220 --> 03:50:02,300
They might scan the ring after the ring.

9092
03:50:02,340 --> 03:50:02,720
Yeah.

9093
03:50:03,060 --> 03:50:04,120
So, yeah.

9094
03:50:04,160 --> 03:50:05,260
We need to scan the ring too.

9095
03:50:05,920 --> 03:50:06,440
Yes.

9096
03:50:08,960 --> 03:50:10,760
I'm gonna... Can people scan the ring?

9097
03:50:10,800 --> 03:50:11,140
No?

9098
03:50:12,320 --> 03:50:14,320
Hiro can if she... No.

9099
03:50:14,440 --> 03:50:14,840
Wait.

9100
03:50:15,020 --> 03:50:16,320
Only people?

9101
03:50:16,900 --> 03:50:17,220
Only people?

9102
03:50:17,220 --> 03:50:17,460
Oh, no, no.

9103
03:50:17,480 --> 03:50:17,840
Only people.

9104
03:50:17,860 --> 03:50:17,960
Yeah.

9105
03:50:18,060 --> 03:50:18,220
Yeah.

9106
03:50:18,320 --> 03:50:18,440
Yeah.

9107
03:50:18,440 --> 03:50:18,520
Yeah.

9108
03:50:18,620 --> 03:50:18,760
Only people.

9109
03:50:19,000 --> 03:50:19,800
Only people.

9110
03:50:19,800 --> 03:50:20,060
Okay.

9111
03:50:20,060 --> 03:50:21,780
Before he could, yeah.

9112
03:50:22,040 --> 03:50:22,200
Yeah.

9113
03:50:22,220 --> 03:50:23,660
Before he could, but now he can't.

9114
03:50:24,540 --> 03:50:24,960
Okay.

9115
03:50:26,180 --> 03:50:26,760
Oh, yeah.

9116
03:50:26,760 --> 03:50:27,440
One team there.

9117
03:50:27,460 --> 03:50:27,940
One team there.

9118
03:50:28,020 --> 03:50:29,740
I think they wait for the ring.

9119
03:50:29,900 --> 03:50:30,280
Okay.

9120
03:50:30,380 --> 03:50:31,680
Hiro, I got you more bats.

9121
03:50:31,960 --> 03:50:34,400
Wait for them to scan the ring first.

9122
03:50:34,440 --> 03:50:35,000
And we scan.

9123
03:50:35,220 --> 03:50:35,580
Thank you.

9124
03:50:36,320 --> 03:50:36,740
Okay.

9125
03:50:36,800 --> 03:50:37,780
Then I'll go here.

9126
03:50:38,120 --> 03:50:38,680
Me too.

9127
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:40,680
I wanna see if there's a scope.

9128
03:50:40,820 --> 03:50:40,920
Yeah.

9129
03:50:40,920 --> 03:50:44,360
I think if we fight, we'll get dirt by the party.

9130
03:50:44,400 --> 03:50:44,640
Yeah.

9131
03:50:44,640 --> 03:50:45,280
I think so too.

9132
03:50:45,620 --> 03:50:48,360
I think so too.

9133
03:50:48,620 --> 03:50:49,140
We gotta be careful.

9134
03:50:49,720 --> 03:50:50,240
Yeah.

9135
03:50:52,260 --> 03:50:53,300
Oh my god.

9136
03:50:53,700 --> 03:50:55,580
We are so careful now.

9137
03:50:55,860 --> 03:50:56,220
Scary.

9138
03:50:56,220 --> 03:50:56,340
Yeah.

9139
03:50:56,840 --> 03:50:57,900
They don't scan the ring?

9140
03:50:58,380 --> 03:50:58,900
No?

9141
03:50:59,100 --> 03:50:59,980
They're not scanning.

9142
03:51:01,100 --> 03:51:02,840
Oh, I think they scan the ring.

9143
03:51:03,140 --> 03:51:04,140
They already scan earlier.

9144
03:51:04,820 --> 03:51:04,980
They rotate it.

9145
03:51:05,920 --> 03:51:07,020
They rotate it.

9146
03:51:07,120 --> 03:51:07,960
Not yet?

9147
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:09,620
One squad.

9148
03:51:09,820 --> 03:51:10,460
So they're still here.

9149
03:51:10,660 --> 03:51:11,280
They're rotating.

9150
03:51:11,620 --> 03:51:13,580
No, there's one squad here.

9151
03:51:13,720 --> 03:51:14,080
Here.

9152
03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:14,700
Oh, okay.

9153
03:51:15,540 --> 03:51:16,660
There's two squads now.

9154
03:51:17,020 --> 03:51:17,540
Okay.

9155
03:51:17,540 --> 03:51:18,160
Two squads?

9156
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:18,540
All right.

9157
03:51:21,500 --> 03:51:21,900
Okay.

9158
03:51:21,900 --> 03:51:22,040
Ooh.

9159
03:51:22,920 --> 03:51:23,740
Can I scan?

9160
03:51:24,740 --> 03:51:25,140
Yeah.

9161
03:51:26,500 --> 03:51:26,900
Just...

9162
03:51:28,040 --> 03:51:29,260
Let me check this game.

9163
03:51:29,460 --> 03:51:29,700
I'm looking.

9164
03:51:29,960 --> 03:51:30,240
I'm looking.

9165
03:51:30,440 --> 03:51:30,700
I'm looking.

9166
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:32,200
This team did not come here.

9167
03:51:32,200 --> 03:51:33,120
They went there.

9168
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:34,340
I'm scanning.

9169
03:51:36,160 --> 03:51:36,560
No.

9170
03:51:36,780 --> 03:51:38,540
There's another team right here.

9171
03:51:38,980 --> 03:51:39,380
Okay.

9172
03:51:39,620 --> 03:51:40,020
Okay.

9173
03:51:41,500 --> 03:51:42,040
All right.

9174
03:51:42,060 --> 03:51:42,400
There's there.

9175
03:51:42,560 --> 03:51:43,580
I'm gonna head to Ditto then.

9176
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:44,220
I'm heading to Ditto.

9177
03:51:44,220 --> 03:51:45,020
Okay.

9178
03:51:45,340 --> 03:51:47,160
They went to the tunnel.

9179
03:51:47,880 --> 03:51:50,240
Maybe we can go to the right.

9180
03:51:50,540 --> 03:51:50,760
All right.

9181
03:51:52,180 --> 03:51:53,940
We can go from the right.

9182
03:51:54,100 --> 03:51:54,500
Maybe.

9183
03:51:55,240 --> 03:51:56,160
I'm heading over.

9184
03:51:56,760 --> 03:51:58,920
I need a scope too far of my carbine.

9185
03:51:58,960 --> 03:51:59,820
If anybody sees one.

9186
03:52:00,980 --> 03:52:02,920
I'm running at zero scopes.

9187
03:52:03,180 --> 03:52:04,840
I have one and two.

9188
03:52:05,500 --> 03:52:07,000
Do you need it?

9189
03:52:07,060 --> 03:52:08,740
No, I don't want that.

9190
03:52:09,100 --> 03:52:12,480
I need a 2 or 3x.

9191
03:52:12,760 --> 03:52:13,260
Yeah.

9192
03:52:13,320 --> 03:52:13,540
Okay.

9193
03:52:14,500 --> 03:52:15,500
We'll find one.

9194
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:15,980
I believe.

9195
03:52:17,480 --> 03:52:18,860
I believe in us.

9196
03:52:18,920 --> 03:52:19,100
Okay.

9197
03:52:19,160 --> 03:52:20,280
One is still here.

9198
03:52:20,800 --> 03:52:21,900
Why are they still here?

9199
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:25,080
Okay.

9200
03:52:26,060 --> 03:52:27,120
Where are they?

9201
03:52:28,100 --> 03:52:28,620
Yeah.

9202
03:52:28,660 --> 03:52:29,480
Where are they?

9203
03:52:30,820 --> 03:52:32,020
Why are you guys here?

9204
03:52:32,080 --> 03:52:32,420
Leave.

9205
03:52:34,620 --> 03:52:35,140
Leave.

9206
03:52:35,200 --> 03:52:37,300
We're trying to gain SR.

9207
03:52:37,340 --> 03:52:40,160
Guys, we're in party on the last line.

9208
03:52:42,020 --> 03:52:44,020
I have evac towers.

9209
03:52:44,220 --> 03:52:44,720
Okay.

9210
03:52:44,840 --> 03:52:45,620
I'm heading over.

9211
03:52:48,720 --> 03:52:49,680
All right.

9212
03:52:52,200 --> 03:52:53,340
I'm heading over.

9213
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:54,300
I'm heading over.

9214
03:52:54,640 --> 03:52:54,980
I'm heading over.

9215
03:52:54,980 --> 03:52:55,460
I'm almost there.

9216
03:52:55,580 --> 03:52:56,600
Somebody has a PK.

9217
03:52:56,820 --> 03:52:57,640
A golden PK.

9218
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:02,280
They're fighting.

9219
03:53:02,500 --> 03:53:02,920
They're fighting.

9220
03:53:03,320 --> 03:53:05,540
We can run.

9221
03:53:06,140 --> 03:53:06,620
Yeah.

9222
03:53:06,680 --> 03:53:07,560
We'll follow them.

9223
03:53:09,060 --> 03:53:09,540
Wait.

9224
03:53:09,640 --> 03:53:09,720
No.

9225
03:53:09,760 --> 03:53:10,100
They're fighting.

9226
03:53:10,380 --> 03:53:11,300
Right over there.

9227
03:53:11,360 --> 03:53:12,660
I will take that.

9228
03:53:12,660 --> 03:53:12,680

03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:15,440
Okay.

9232
03:53:16,100 --> 03:53:17,320
They're fighting right here.

9233
03:53:17,680 --> 03:53:18,980
We'll fly over them.

9234
03:53:20,060 --> 03:53:20,840
They're lacing.

9235
03:53:21,020 --> 03:53:21,300
They're lacing.

9236
03:53:21,760 --> 03:53:22,200
Okay.

9237
03:53:22,200 --> 03:53:22,600

9238
03:53:22,980 --> 03:53:23,420

9239
03:53:23,440 --> 03:53:23,760
We go.

9240
03:53:24,620 --> 03:53:25,960
We take over there.

9241
03:53:26,200 --> 03:53:27,880
I don't have a scope for this.

9242
03:53:28,140 --> 03:53:31,180
We shoot them from the backs.

9243
03:53:32,180 --> 03:53:32,620
Here.

9244
03:53:32,640 --> 03:53:33,360
One guy here.

Yeah.

9246
03:53:33,640 --> 03:53:34,180
Shoot them from the backs.

9247
03:53:34,300 --> 03:53:35,020
I'll go with Ditto.

9248
03:53:35,580 --> 03:53:36,680
I'm in with Ditto too.

9249
03:53:40,580 --> 03:53:41,380
I caught Mirage.

9250
03:53:42,060 --> 03:53:42,560
I'm looking.

9251
03:53:42,880 --> 03:53:43,320
Let me scan.

9252
03:53:43,900 --> 03:53:44,460

9253
03:53:45,420 --> 03:53:46,200
I got Mirage.

9254
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:46,660

9255
03:53:48,760 --> 03:53:49,160

9256
03:53:49,620 --> 03:53:50,020
Wait.

9257
03:53:50,100 --> 03:53:50,800
I didn't get Mirage.

9258
03:53:50,800 --> 03:53:51,820
I got somebody else.

9259
03:53:51,960 --> 03:53:52,240

9260
03:53:52,520 --> 03:53:52,820

9265
03:54:01,340 --> 03:54:01,740
Okay.

9266
03:54:01,800 --> 03:54:02,660
I will go right.

9267
03:54:02,780 --> 03:54:03,300
I will go right.

9268
03:54:03,360 --> 03:54:03,780
I got scope.

9269
03:54:03,820 --> 03:54:04,200

9270
03:54:04,800 --> 03:54:05,200

9272
03:54:10,120 --> 03:54:10,400
Three.

9273
03:54:10,520 --> 03:54:11,140
Where's the guy?

9274
03:54:11,520 --> 03:54:12,080
One on me.

9275
03:54:12,140 --> 03:54:12,420
One on me.

9276
03:54:12,480 --> 03:54:14,520
I broke the one in front of you, Ditto.

9277
03:54:15,060 --> 03:54:16,220
I'm heading over to you.

9278
03:54:16,480 --> 03:54:16,760
Nice.

9279
03:54:16,960 --> 03:54:17,240
Pushing.

9280
03:54:17,340 --> 03:54:17,500
Pushing.

9281
03:54:17,580 --> 03:54:17,780
Pushing.

9282
03:54:19,840 --> 03:54:20,380
They're pushing you.

9283
03:54:20,440 --> 03:54:21,000
They're pushing you.

9284
03:54:21,980 --> 03:54:22,500
I'm batting.

9285
03:54:22,520 --> 03:54:22,880
I'm batting.

9286
03:54:23,920 --> 03:54:24,200
Pushing.

9287
03:54:24,200 --> 03:54:24,380
Pushing.

9288
03:54:24,480 --> 03:54:24,760
Full push.

9289
03:54:25,740 --> 03:54:26,680
They caustic ulted us.

9290
03:54:26,900 --> 03:54:27,280
They're lacing.

9291
03:54:27,360 --> 03:54:27,640
They're lacing.

9292
03:54:28,360 --> 03:54:29,020
Come back to us.

9293
03:54:29,020 --> 03:54:29,560
Come back to us again.

9294
03:54:31,640 --> 03:54:31,920
Okay.

9295
03:54:32,060 --> 03:54:32,620
I will go back.

9296
03:54:32,700 --> 03:54:33,120
I will go back.

9297
03:54:33,180 --> 03:54:34,940
Another team is shooting us.

9298
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:35,680
We have to back up.

9299
03:54:35,860 --> 03:54:36,140
Okay.

9300
03:54:36,140 --> 03:54:36,440
I'm back.

9301
03:54:36,500 --> 03:54:36,740
I'm back.

9302
03:54:36,740 --> 03:54:36,980
I'm back.

9303
03:54:38,260 --> 03:54:38,540
Yeah.

9304
03:54:38,580 --> 03:54:38,700
Yeah.

9305
03:54:38,700 --> 03:54:39,700
There's too many teams shooting us.

9306
03:54:40,200 --> 03:54:41,700
They have new castle.

9307
03:54:42,060 --> 03:54:42,540
Yeah.

9308
03:54:42,780 --> 03:54:44,140
They have caustic too.

9309
03:54:44,940 --> 03:54:45,420
Okay.

9310
03:54:46,480 --> 03:54:47,400
Oh, that's a window.

9311
03:54:49,200 --> 03:54:50,340
There's a guy right there.

9312
03:54:50,440 --> 03:54:52,020
There's a guy right here shooting us too.

9313
03:54:53,300 --> 03:54:53,780
Wait.

9314
03:54:53,800 --> 03:54:54,180
To my left.

9315
03:54:54,320 --> 03:54:54,800
To my left.

9316
03:54:55,320 --> 03:54:56,100
To my left.

9317
03:54:56,100 --> 03:54:56,100
To my left.

9318
03:54:56,100 --> 03:54:56,780
They're flying over us.

9319
03:54:56,800 --> 03:54:57,480
They're flying over us.

9320
03:54:57,640 --> 03:54:58,120
It's okay.

9321
03:54:58,460 --> 03:54:58,940
Yeah.

9322
03:54:59,220 --> 03:55:00,280
This team is still here.

9323
03:55:00,680 --> 03:55:01,760
I'm giving us cover.

9324
03:55:02,960 --> 03:55:04,620
This one didn't make it.

9325
03:55:04,800 --> 03:55:06,000
This one didn't make it.

9326
03:55:06,260 --> 03:55:06,740
Oh.

9327
03:55:07,840 --> 03:55:08,320
Mmm.

9328
03:55:09,800 --> 03:55:09,980
I'm batting.

9329
03:55:10,060 --> 03:55:10,380
I'm batting.

9330
03:55:10,660 --> 03:55:11,620
There's a heal drone on me.

9331
03:55:13,940 --> 03:55:14,860
Be careful, Ditto.

9332
03:55:16,100 --> 03:55:16,500
Okay.

9333
03:55:17,720 --> 03:55:18,160
Cracked him.

9334
03:55:18,240 --> 03:55:18,620
Cracked him.

9335
03:55:18,700 --> 03:55:19,380
I can't see.

9336
03:55:19,700 --> 03:55:20,360
Oh my god.

9337
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:23,560
Okay.

9338
03:55:23,620 --> 03:55:24,360
I got us a lot of bats.

9339
03:55:26,140 --> 03:55:28,080
I'm gonna eat an alt-xl.

9340
03:55:28,620 --> 03:55:29,020
Okay.

9341
03:55:29,220 --> 03:55:29,480
Oh.

9342
03:55:30,680 --> 03:55:32,200
I have only one size.

9343
03:55:33,980 --> 03:55:34,380
Alright.

9344
03:55:35,520 --> 03:55:36,740
I get almost EMP.

9345
03:55:36,740 --> 03:55:38,360
They're running to the left.

9346
03:55:38,420 --> 03:55:39,360
There's a team to our left as well.

9347
03:55:39,420 --> 03:55:39,620
Careful.

9348
03:55:39,800 --> 03:55:40,480
I'm ping them.

9349
03:55:40,740 --> 03:55:42,620
I think they will get shot.

9350
03:55:44,500 --> 03:55:47,220
If they got shot from the left side.

9351
03:55:47,820 --> 03:55:48,880
I'm gonna get across.

9352
03:55:48,960 --> 03:55:49,760
I'm getting across right now.

9353
03:55:49,960 --> 03:55:50,600
They ran.

9354
03:55:50,700 --> 03:55:50,940
They ran.

9355
03:55:50,960 --> 03:55:51,200
They ran.

9356
03:55:51,220 --> 03:55:51,580
They rotated.

9357
03:55:52,760 --> 03:55:53,200
Okay.

9358
03:55:53,480 --> 03:55:53,660
Okay.

9359
03:55:53,940 --> 03:55:56,380
This team is also redeployed.

9360
03:55:56,400 --> 03:55:57,420
I gotta get ammo.

9361
03:55:57,660 --> 03:55:58,840
I have no ammo.

9362
03:55:59,060 --> 03:56:00,220
I'm gonna get here.

9363
03:56:00,820 --> 03:56:01,500
What ammo?

9364
03:56:02,340 --> 03:56:03,020
I'll light.

9365
03:56:03,300 --> 03:56:04,000
I'll get it.

9366
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:05,160
I'm watching them fly.

9367
03:56:05,300 --> 03:56:06,000
I wanna know where they're going.

9368
03:56:06,680 --> 03:56:07,340
Let's do that.

9369
03:56:07,580 --> 03:56:08,160
There's a rat.

9370
03:56:08,260 --> 03:56:08,540
Wait.

9371
03:56:08,680 --> 03:56:09,340
That's another team.

9372
03:56:09,460 --> 03:56:10,480
There's a rat team here.

9373
03:56:15,470 --> 03:56:16,990
Make sure they don't fly to us.

9374
03:56:17,170 --> 03:56:17,470
Yeah.

9375
03:56:17,530 --> 03:56:18,210
They ran this way.

9376
03:56:19,630 --> 03:56:20,810
They're called this way.

9377
03:56:20,970 --> 03:56:21,990
We can keep here.

9378
03:56:22,070 --> 03:56:22,670
We can keep here.

9379
03:56:23,530 --> 03:56:24,230
They're still here.

9380
03:56:24,350 --> 03:56:24,910
They're still here.

9381
03:56:25,210 --> 03:56:25,570
Okay.

9382
03:56:26,050 --> 03:56:26,930
I don't see them.

9383
03:56:26,990 --> 03:56:27,470
I don't see them.

9384
03:56:27,570 --> 03:56:28,390
I don't have an angle.

9385
03:56:29,130 --> 03:56:29,750
No angle.

9386
03:56:29,790 --> 03:56:30,030
No angle.

9387
03:56:30,910 --> 03:56:31,270
Okay.

9388
03:56:31,310 --> 03:56:31,550
Okay.

9389
03:56:31,990 --> 03:56:34,370
What kind of ammo do you need, Hiro?

9390
03:56:35,210 --> 03:56:35,990
I'm coming back.

9391
03:56:36,030 --> 03:56:36,790
I need the light.

9392
03:56:36,810 --> 03:56:37,670
I have no light.

9393
03:56:37,810 --> 03:56:38,070
Okay.

9394
03:56:39,070 --> 03:56:40,610
We have to take this spot.

9395
03:56:41,210 --> 03:56:41,610
Okay.

9396
03:56:41,710 --> 03:56:42,310
I have my ult.

9397
03:56:42,610 --> 03:56:43,970
There's a team to our right here though.

9398
03:56:44,090 --> 03:56:44,610
That's the thing.

9399
03:56:46,670 --> 03:56:47,510
They went there.

9400
03:56:48,270 --> 03:56:49,050
They went there.

9401
03:56:49,230 --> 03:56:49,670
I'm going across.

9402
03:56:49,830 --> 03:56:50,550
I'm getting across here.

9403
03:56:51,170 --> 03:56:51,990
They're still there.

9404
03:56:52,110 --> 03:56:52,810
They're still here.

9405
03:56:53,930 --> 03:56:54,330
Wait.

9406
03:56:54,370 --> 03:56:54,530
Down?

9407
03:56:54,630 --> 03:56:54,910
Nice.

9408
03:56:54,990 --> 03:56:55,290
Nice.

9409
03:56:56,550 --> 03:56:57,930
They have new castle.

9410
03:56:58,190 --> 03:56:58,590
Yeah.

9411
03:57:00,070 --> 03:57:01,190
We can do that.

9412
03:57:02,410 --> 03:57:02,810
Nice.

9413
03:57:02,810 --> 03:57:03,170
Nice.

9414
03:57:03,330 --> 03:57:03,470
Nice.

9415
03:57:03,470 --> 03:57:04,990
I killed an enemy.

9416
03:57:06,130 --> 03:57:07,050
Be careful here.

9417
03:57:07,550 --> 03:57:07,990
Okay.

9418
03:57:08,150 --> 03:57:09,530
I'm looking behind us just in case.

9419
03:57:09,810 --> 03:57:10,750
I actually cracked.

9420
03:57:10,930 --> 03:57:11,190
Did you?

9421
03:57:11,830 --> 03:57:12,970
Make sure there's no rats.

9422
03:57:13,210 --> 03:57:14,930
I do need... I do need...

9423
03:57:14,930 --> 03:57:15,830
What ammo do you need?

9424
03:57:15,870 --> 03:57:16,170
What ammo?

9425
03:57:16,470 --> 03:57:18,930
I don't have it.

9426
03:57:19,150 --> 03:57:19,730
It's okay.

9427
03:57:20,570 --> 03:57:21,010
Okay.

9428
03:57:21,070 --> 03:57:21,430
Thank you.

9429
03:57:21,930 --> 03:57:22,370
Where?

9430
03:57:23,110 --> 03:57:24,750
Is there anybody on this box?

9431
03:57:25,010 --> 03:57:25,330
No.

9432
03:57:25,350 --> 03:57:25,610
No.

9433
03:57:25,630 --> 03:57:27,630
That's why I wanted to go try and loot it.

9434
03:57:28,430 --> 03:57:28,910
That's right.

9435
03:57:29,130 --> 03:57:30,470
Can you use your dawn?

9436
03:57:30,950 --> 03:57:31,350
Yes.

9437
03:57:31,490 --> 03:57:34,150
If there's one, people, we can go...

9438
03:57:34,150 --> 03:57:34,790
Oh.

9439
03:57:34,910 --> 03:57:35,150
Wait.

9440
03:57:35,270 --> 03:57:35,470
Here.

9441
03:57:35,610 --> 03:57:35,730
Here.

9442
03:57:35,830 --> 03:57:36,070
Here.

9443
03:57:36,130 --> 03:57:36,270
Here.

9444
03:57:36,270 --> 03:57:36,610
Here.

9445
03:57:36,870 --> 03:57:37,450
Right here.

9446
03:57:37,530 --> 03:57:37,730
Right here.

9447
03:57:37,770 --> 03:57:38,030
Right here.

9448
03:57:39,350 --> 03:57:39,970
They kill.

9449
03:57:40,050 --> 03:57:40,290
They kill.

9450
03:57:41,230 --> 03:57:41,630
Here.

9451
03:57:41,710 --> 03:57:41,910
Here.

9452
03:57:41,910 --> 03:57:42,050
Here.

9453
03:57:42,050 --> 03:57:42,270
Wait.

9454
03:57:42,890 --> 03:57:44,030
You should go loot that.

9455
03:57:44,050 --> 03:57:46,330
Go loot that box for ammo for Hiro.

9456
03:57:46,510 --> 03:57:47,370
Just loot it for him.

9457
03:57:47,470 --> 03:57:48,470
You should go there.

9458
03:57:48,930 --> 03:57:51,710
You loot all the ammo for us and then you come back to us.

9459
03:57:51,990 --> 03:57:53,450
Because Hiro can't...

9460
03:57:53,450 --> 03:57:55,450
Hiro is more dangerous to go.

9461
03:57:55,510 --> 03:57:58,790
This guy is shooting the bottom guy.

9462
03:57:59,090 --> 03:57:59,490
Okay.

9463
03:57:59,510 --> 03:58:00,450
They have a lot of ammo.

9464
03:58:00,470 --> 03:58:01,530
They have a lot of light ammo.

9465
03:58:01,550 --> 03:58:03,010
Grab all the light ammo to us.

9466
03:58:03,110 --> 03:58:03,930
I need some too.

9467
03:58:04,770 --> 03:58:05,030
Okay.

9468
03:58:06,290 --> 03:58:07,410
Grab as much as you can.

9469
03:58:10,110 --> 03:58:10,470
Okay.

9470
03:58:10,470 --> 03:58:10,790
A lot.

9471
03:58:10,950 --> 03:58:11,290
Okay.

9472
03:58:11,370 --> 03:58:12,030
I think EMP...

9473
03:58:13,090 --> 03:58:13,810
And here.

9474
03:58:15,450 --> 03:58:15,810
Where?

9475
03:58:17,190 --> 03:58:17,550
Here.

9476
03:58:18,070 --> 03:58:18,430
Here.

9477
03:58:18,430 --> 03:58:18,610
Here.

9478
03:58:18,730 --> 03:58:18,790
Here.

9479
03:58:18,930 --> 03:58:20,370
I dropped some too.

9480
03:58:20,770 --> 03:58:21,870
What else is in there?

9481
03:58:22,550 --> 03:58:25,470
We have to go to a point.

9482
03:58:26,190 --> 03:58:28,890
We have to go find a place to stay at.

9483
03:58:29,030 --> 03:58:29,190
Okay.

9484
03:58:30,470 --> 03:58:30,790
We have to redeploy.

9485
03:58:30,810 --> 03:58:31,890
Where do we go?

9486
03:58:32,230 --> 03:58:34,470
Over there.

9487
03:58:35,010 --> 03:58:36,350
We need to figure out a place to go.

9488
03:58:36,370 --> 03:58:36,690
Over there.

9489
03:58:36,950 --> 03:58:37,730
Let me check.

9490
03:58:37,870 --> 03:58:38,070
Let me check.

9491
03:58:38,890 --> 03:58:39,610
There is a guy.

9492
03:58:40,090 --> 03:58:40,450
Okay.

9493
03:58:40,570 --> 03:58:40,750
Okay.

9494
03:58:43,230 --> 03:58:43,930
I'll get it.

9495
03:58:44,270 --> 03:58:48,170
I will take the top.

9496
03:58:49,430 --> 03:58:50,490
They are all here.

9497
03:58:50,530 --> 03:58:51,070
They are all here.

9498
03:58:52,030 --> 03:58:52,790
It's all here.

9499
03:58:54,150 --> 03:58:54,810
I'm getting closer.

9500
03:58:54,930 --> 03:58:55,210
I'm getting closer.

9501
03:58:56,810 --> 03:58:57,530
I'm coming.

9502
03:58:57,750 --> 03:58:57,890
I'm coming.

9503
03:59:00,310 --> 03:59:00,810
I'm here.

9504
03:59:01,110 --> 03:59:01,470
I'm here.

9505
03:59:01,970 --> 03:59:02,330
Okay.

9506
03:59:03,410 --> 03:59:04,790
I knocked two.

9507
03:59:04,890 --> 03:59:05,390
Only one.

9508
03:59:05,390 --> 03:59:06,030
I can't.

9509
03:59:06,030 --> 03:59:06,410
I can't.

9510
03:59:06,690 --> 03:59:07,530
He is down here.

9511
03:59:07,550 --> 03:59:07,970
He is down here.

9512
03:59:08,530 --> 03:59:09,090
I'm batting.

9513
03:59:09,190 --> 03:59:09,730
I'm batting.

9514
03:59:09,750 --> 03:59:10,090
I'm batting.

9515
03:59:10,630 --> 03:59:11,970
I can't do anything about it.

9516
03:59:13,250 --> 03:59:14,090
Where is he?

9517
03:59:14,210 --> 03:59:14,550
Where is he?

9518
03:59:14,750 --> 03:59:15,530
Right below us.

9519
03:59:15,770 --> 03:59:17,710
Hero needs a zip if you have one.

9520
03:59:19,030 --> 03:59:19,710
Where is he?

9521
03:59:20,010 --> 03:59:20,370
Oh.

9522
03:59:20,690 --> 03:59:21,310
Loot for this.

9523
03:59:21,350 --> 03:59:21,550
Loot.

9524
03:59:21,570 --> 03:59:21,670
Loot.

9525
03:59:21,790 --> 03:59:21,790
Loot.

9526
03:59:22,130 --> 03:59:22,910
You need loot.

9527
03:59:25,330 --> 03:59:25,690
Okay.

9528
03:59:28,270 --> 03:59:29,590
Let's see if that has loot too.

9529
03:59:31,670 --> 03:59:33,190
This is... I need some loot too.

9530
03:59:33,330 --> 03:59:33,650
Okay.

9531
03:59:34,370 --> 03:59:34,750
Okay.

9532
03:59:35,910 --> 03:59:37,150
I can go back out.

9533
03:59:37,730 --> 03:59:37,910
Yeah.

9534
03:59:38,010 --> 03:59:38,570
I can go back out.

9535
03:59:38,870 --> 03:59:42,230
We need you to get us a zip to come back up.

9536
03:59:43,030 --> 03:59:43,290
Oh.

9537
03:59:43,410 --> 03:59:44,090
I don't have a zip.

9538
03:59:44,430 --> 03:59:44,810
Okay.

9539
03:59:44,870 --> 03:59:46,710
So we need to figure out how to get back up then.

9540
03:59:47,190 --> 03:59:47,570
Wait.

9541
03:59:47,650 --> 03:59:47,830
Wait.

9542
03:59:47,830 --> 03:59:48,130
Oh.

9543
03:59:48,130 --> 03:59:48,390
Wait.

9544
03:59:50,310 --> 03:59:50,690
550.

9545
03:59:50,690 --> 03:59:51,530
We can...

9546
03:59:51,530 --> 03:59:53,530
We can stay here.

9547
03:59:53,670 --> 03:59:54,050
Oh.

9548
03:59:54,730 --> 03:59:55,110
Wait.

9549
03:59:55,130 --> 03:59:55,290
Wait.

9550
03:59:55,290 --> 03:59:55,530
Wait.

9551
03:59:56,290 --> 03:59:56,670
What?

9552
03:59:57,890 --> 03:59:58,010
I'm broken.

9553
03:59:58,790 --> 03:59:59,510
I can't get to you.

9554
03:59:59,630 --> 03:59:59,690
Oh.

9555
03:59:59,710 --> 03:59:59,950
I can.

9556
04:00:00,030 --> 04:00:00,250
Okay.

9557
04:00:00,310 --> 04:00:00,510
Come over.

9558
04:00:00,650 --> 04:00:00,890
Nice.

9559
04:00:00,970 --> 04:00:01,250
Nice.

9560
04:00:01,350 --> 04:00:01,630
Nice.

9561
04:00:02,550 --> 04:00:03,290
We can come up.

9562
04:00:03,310 --> 04:00:03,950
We can climb up here.

9563
04:00:03,950 --> 04:00:04,690
We can climb up here.

9564
04:00:04,750 --> 04:00:05,350
We can climb up here.

9565
04:00:05,490 --> 04:00:05,770
Guys.

9566
04:00:05,830 --> 04:00:05,970
Guys.

9567
04:00:05,970 --> 04:00:06,070
Guys.

9568
04:00:06,070 --> 04:00:06,330
Okay.

9569
04:00:09,570 --> 04:00:11,090
I'm figuring out how to do this climb.

9570
04:00:11,450 --> 04:00:12,230
I just did it.

9571
04:00:13,750 --> 04:00:14,410
Here you go.

9572
04:00:14,830 --> 04:00:15,110
Oh.

9573
04:00:15,130 --> 04:00:15,350
No.

9574
04:00:16,310 --> 04:00:16,590
Here.

9575
04:00:17,830 --> 04:00:17,910
Here.

9576
04:00:19,210 --> 04:00:20,050
We climb this.

9577
04:00:22,830 --> 04:00:23,110
Okay.

9578
04:00:24,150 --> 04:00:24,870
Give it... Oh.

9579
04:00:25,070 --> 04:00:25,350
Okay.

9580
04:00:25,350 --> 04:00:27,290
I don't think we need it.

9581
04:00:27,590 --> 04:00:27,950
Yeah.

9582
04:00:29,670 --> 04:00:30,170
We're in zone.

9583
04:00:30,230 --> 04:00:30,630
We're in zone here.

9584
04:00:30,710 --> 04:00:31,010
We're in zone here.

9585
04:00:31,830 --> 04:00:33,050
We have to take the high ground.

9586
04:00:34,510 --> 04:00:34,870
Yeah.

9587
04:00:34,870 --> 04:00:35,610
But this is zone.

9588
04:00:35,650 --> 04:00:35,950
This is zone.

9589
04:00:38,090 --> 04:00:38,450
Yeah.

9590
04:00:38,450 --> 04:00:38,450
But this is zone.

9591
04:00:38,450 --> 04:00:38,450
This is zone.

9592
04:00:38,450 --> 04:00:39,030
Be careful here.

9593
04:00:39,050 --> 04:00:39,270
Yeah.

9594
04:00:39,910 --> 04:00:40,270
Yeah.

9595
04:00:40,390 --> 04:00:40,750
Yeah.

9596
04:00:40,850 --> 04:00:41,990
You can come here, Doki.

9597
04:00:43,470 --> 04:00:43,830
Yeah.

9598
04:00:44,130 --> 04:00:44,370
Yeah.

9599
04:00:44,570 --> 04:00:45,350
It's safe on me too.

9600
04:00:46,350 --> 04:00:48,050
I'm giving us cover here.

9601
04:00:48,370 --> 04:00:48,730
Okay.

9602
04:00:48,810 --> 04:00:49,070
Okay.

9603
04:00:51,890 --> 04:00:52,770
Let me check.

9604
04:00:57,800 --> 04:00:58,980
They're in the truck.

9605
04:00:58,980 --> 04:00:59,640
They're in the truck.

9606
04:01:00,860 --> 04:01:02,200
And then this one is over here.

9607
04:01:03,100 --> 04:01:06,080
I'm gonna look at them from the side here.

9608
04:01:06,340 --> 04:01:07,800
There's one behind there.

9609
04:01:08,680 --> 04:01:09,160
Okay.

9610
04:01:10,720 --> 04:01:11,940
I will stay on tall.

9611
04:01:12,740 --> 04:01:14,120
I will stay on tall.

9612
04:01:14,120 --> 04:01:15,980
I cracked the guys over there.

9613
04:01:16,200 --> 04:01:16,820
Oh my gosh.

9614
04:01:16,880 --> 04:01:17,480
What the f***?

9615
04:01:18,720 --> 04:01:19,200
Okay.

9616
04:01:19,380 --> 04:01:20,760
They did not like me.

9617
04:01:22,620 --> 04:01:24,200
They broke my door.

9618
04:01:24,500 --> 04:01:25,540
I almost have EVE.

9619
04:01:25,580 --> 04:01:25,680
I'm gonna go EMP.

9620
04:01:26,500 --> 04:01:26,980
Woah.

9621
04:01:27,360 --> 04:01:27,600
Wait.

9622
04:01:27,600 --> 04:01:28,620
They're charging you.

9623
04:01:29,300 --> 04:01:31,840
Guys, I need help.

9624
04:01:32,280 --> 04:01:33,200
They're full pushing.

9625
04:01:33,540 --> 04:01:34,820
What the f***?

9626
04:01:35,240 --> 04:01:36,500
One hit lifeline.

9627
04:01:36,620 --> 04:01:37,700
One hit lifeline?

9628
04:01:38,880 --> 04:01:39,660
He's low.

9629
04:01:40,000 --> 04:01:40,420
He's low.

9630
04:01:41,500 --> 04:01:41,980
Nice.

9631
04:01:42,100 --> 04:01:42,240
Nice.

9632
04:01:42,300 --> 04:01:42,420
Nice.

9633
04:01:42,420 --> 04:01:42,760
Last guy.

9634
04:01:42,840 --> 04:01:43,040
Last guy.

9635
04:01:43,080 --> 04:01:43,240
Last guy.

9636
04:01:45,100 --> 04:01:47,480
What the f*** is wrong with them?

9637
04:01:48,360 --> 04:01:48,840
Swap.

9638
04:01:48,840 --> 04:01:49,020
Swap.

9639
04:01:49,060 --> 04:01:49,500
Yeah.

9640
04:01:51,260 --> 04:01:52,620
What's wrong with them?

9641
04:01:52,620 --> 04:01:52,860
Yeah.

9642
04:01:52,980 --> 04:01:54,620
Why did they push me?

9643
04:01:54,660 --> 04:01:54,900
I'll go look at another one.

9644
04:01:56,200 --> 04:01:57,940
They did not...

9645
04:01:57,940 --> 04:02:00,520
They were really mad that I did that.

9646
04:02:00,940 --> 04:02:01,380
Wait.

9647
04:02:01,380 --> 04:02:01,780
This squad...

9648
04:02:02,240 --> 04:02:03,540
I need to take the hiding off.

9649
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:04,640
They're fighting.

9650
04:02:04,840 --> 04:02:06,380
I need to grab loot.

9651
04:02:06,380 --> 04:02:06,860
They're fighting.

9652
04:02:09,400 --> 04:02:10,400
I'm coming over.

9653
04:02:11,920 --> 04:02:12,360
Here.

9654
04:02:12,520 --> 04:02:12,960
All broke.

9655
04:02:15,200 --> 04:02:16,000
I'm pushing up.

9656
04:02:16,380 --> 04:02:16,860
Over there.

9657
04:02:22,700 --> 04:02:23,220
Let's push.

9658
04:02:23,360 --> 04:02:23,520
Let's push.

9659
04:02:23,640 --> 04:02:23,940
One.

9660
04:02:24,320 --> 04:02:24,760
Okay.

9661
04:02:25,340 --> 04:02:26,020
I got one.

9662
04:02:27,480 --> 04:02:27,840
Resing.

9663
04:02:27,860 --> 04:02:28,060
Resing.

9664
04:02:28,440 --> 04:02:28,700
Yeah.

9665
04:02:28,760 --> 04:02:29,760
You should be able to get...

9666
04:02:29,760 --> 04:02:30,460
Dead.

9667
04:02:34,910 --> 04:02:35,470
I'm pushing.

9668
04:02:35,750 --> 04:02:36,930
I don't know if they're flash yet.

9669
04:02:36,990 --> 04:02:37,290
Dead.

9670
04:02:37,350 --> 04:02:37,550
Dead.

9671
04:02:37,570 --> 04:02:37,690
Dead.

9672
04:02:38,370 --> 04:02:38,910
I'm batting.

9673
04:02:38,950 --> 04:02:39,150
I'm batting.

9674
04:02:39,370 --> 04:02:39,730
Okay.

9675
04:02:43,430 --> 04:02:43,790
Alright.

9676
04:02:44,770 --> 04:02:45,330
I'm climbing.

9677
04:02:45,470 --> 04:02:45,670
I'm climbing.

9678
04:02:49,530 --> 04:02:50,350
Where are they?

9679
04:02:50,690 --> 04:02:51,270
To my left.

9680
04:02:51,290 --> 04:02:51,590
To my left.

9681
04:02:51,710 --> 04:02:52,010
To my left.

9682
04:02:52,450 --> 04:02:52,810
Here.

9683
04:02:53,130 --> 04:02:53,250
Here.

9684
04:02:53,290 --> 04:02:53,370
Here.

9685
04:02:53,470 --> 04:02:53,510
Here.

9686
04:02:54,330 --> 04:02:54,690
69.

9687
04:02:54,690 --> 04:02:55,050
Nice.

9688
04:02:57,370 --> 04:02:57,690
Over here.

9689
04:02:58,790 --> 04:02:59,310
Um.

9690
04:03:00,690 --> 04:03:01,210
Broke.

9691
04:03:01,210 --> 04:03:01,490
Broke.

9692
04:03:01,490 --> 04:03:01,810
Broke.

9693
04:03:02,990 --> 04:03:03,510
Yeah.

9694
04:03:03,510 --> 04:03:04,170
I'm here.

9695
04:03:05,050 --> 04:03:05,570
Nice.

9696
04:03:05,710 --> 04:03:06,350
Last team.

9697
04:03:06,410 --> 04:03:06,690
Nice.

9698
04:03:07,130 --> 04:03:07,650
Last?

9699
04:03:08,870 --> 04:03:09,530
Oh yeah.

9700
04:03:10,590 --> 04:03:11,310
It's solo.

9701
04:03:12,110 --> 04:03:12,630
Yeah.

9702
04:03:14,570 --> 04:03:15,910
We played seriously.

9703
04:03:16,170 --> 04:03:16,450
Yeah.

9704
04:03:16,450 --> 04:03:16,710
See.

9705
04:03:16,810 --> 04:03:18,430
We played seriously guys.

9706
04:03:18,530 --> 04:03:20,250
We can win when we're serious.

9707
04:03:20,850 --> 04:03:21,370
Okay.

9708
04:03:21,390 --> 04:03:22,610
We can win when we're fucking around.

9709
04:03:22,710 --> 04:03:24,050
And we can win when we're serious.

9710
04:03:25,430 --> 04:03:26,110
Oh my god.

9711
04:03:27,170 --> 04:03:28,090
Holy shit.

9712
04:03:28,210 --> 04:03:29,950
What the fuck was that team that rushed me?

9713
04:03:30,370 --> 04:03:31,170
That was actually...

9714
04:03:31,170 --> 04:03:33,050
I was like... I was like...

9715
04:03:33,050 --> 04:03:34,450
I think... I think...

9716
04:03:34,450 --> 04:03:37,310
I think they thought that they were solo.

9717
04:03:37,570 --> 04:03:38,370
I think so too.

9718
04:03:38,510 --> 04:03:39,530
I think they thought I was solo.

9719
04:03:40,090 --> 04:03:40,570
Yeah.

9720
04:03:40,710 --> 04:03:41,630
So they pushed you.

9721
04:03:41,830 --> 04:03:42,110
Yeah.

9722
04:03:42,130 --> 04:03:43,610
They like... I was like...

9723
04:03:43,610 --> 04:03:45,390
I cracked one of them and then...

9724
04:03:45,390 --> 04:03:46,290
They did not like that.

9725
04:03:46,350 --> 04:03:46,970
They were so mad.

9726
04:03:47,630 --> 04:03:48,790
I think they were angry.

9727
04:03:49,130 --> 04:03:50,670
They might have been angry.

9728
04:03:50,670 --> 04:03:52,130
I was like...

9729
04:03:52,130 --> 04:03:53,490
What did I do?

9730
04:03:54,090 --> 04:03:56,250
I'm just playing support.

9731
04:04:00,450 --> 04:04:00,930
Yeah.

9732
04:04:01,050 --> 04:04:02,470
I was like... I was like scanning around.

9733
04:04:02,550 --> 04:04:03,330
I was like... Wait a minute.

9734
04:04:03,410 --> 04:04:04,130
They're all there.

9735
04:04:04,670 --> 04:04:05,150
Yeah.

9736
04:04:05,310 --> 04:04:06,490
I cracked one.

9737
04:04:06,550 --> 04:04:07,630
And then they pushed me.

9738
04:04:07,770 --> 04:04:08,670
I was like...

9739
04:04:08,670 --> 04:04:09,190
Guys.

9740
04:04:11,230 --> 04:04:12,750
Why didn't you push me?

9741
04:04:15,190 --> 04:04:15,670
Yeah.

9742
04:04:15,790 --> 04:04:16,810
They pushed in and died.

9743
04:04:17,190 --> 04:04:17,670
Yeah.

9744
04:04:17,670 --> 04:04:18,590
That was so fucked up.

9745
04:04:19,030 --> 04:04:19,510
Guys.

9746
04:04:20,670 --> 04:04:21,590
I'm gonna go push a solo lifeline.

9747
04:04:21,710 --> 04:04:22,910
Cause she's never solo.

9748
04:04:23,250 --> 04:04:24,490
She's not solo.

9749
04:04:25,310 --> 04:04:27,450
Life can get crafters.

9750
04:04:27,570 --> 04:04:28,290
So yeah.

9751
04:04:28,810 --> 04:04:30,770
It's like... never assume.

9752
04:04:32,470 --> 04:04:33,850
That's so messed up.

9753
04:04:36,690 --> 04:04:38,810
Ditto is sure to be like...

9754
04:04:38,810 --> 04:04:40,170
You're still gold one, Ditto?

9755
04:04:40,450 --> 04:04:41,510
You're still gold one?

9756
04:04:41,870 --> 04:04:43,150
When are you plat?

9757
04:04:45,450 --> 04:04:46,930
I'm actually really surprised.

9758
04:04:47,390 --> 04:04:47,650
Yeah.

9759
04:04:47,750 --> 04:04:48,870
You're still gold one.

9760
04:04:49,090 --> 04:04:50,650
I thought that was their plat game.

9761
04:04:51,590 --> 04:04:52,350
Me too.

9762
04:04:52,570 --> 04:04:54,350
Like we got a lot of points there.

9763
04:04:54,450 --> 04:04:54,750
Yeah.

9764
04:04:54,790 --> 04:04:55,370
We got a lot of points.

9765
04:04:55,490 --> 04:04:56,770
And we got first.

9766
04:05:00,830 --> 04:05:02,230
Alright, Ditto.

9767
04:05:03,590 --> 04:05:04,510
Oh no.

9768
04:05:04,990 --> 04:05:08,110
I feel like Hiro is gonna get gold before she gets plat.

9769
04:05:10,350 --> 04:05:10,810
Why?

9770
04:05:11,090 --> 04:05:11,430
Why?

9771
04:05:11,730 --> 04:05:15,170
I think if we go on again, I might get plat.

9772
04:05:15,890 --> 04:05:16,350
Alright.

9773
04:05:16,470 --> 04:05:17,030
Here we go.

9774
04:05:17,030 --> 04:05:18,670
Okay, we go Skyhook.

9775
04:05:18,810 --> 04:05:19,290
Alright.

9776
04:05:19,430 --> 04:05:20,330
Ooh, Ditto discorded.

9777
04:05:20,330 --> 04:05:20,590
Oh no, countdown.

9778
04:05:22,510 --> 04:05:24,190
Ditto got little robotic there.

9779
04:05:24,190 --> 04:05:26,410
I have a master's trail.

9780
04:05:26,490 --> 04:05:27,050
I see that.

9781
04:05:27,210 --> 04:05:28,510
Ditto's becoming like a plat fighter.

9782
04:05:28,510 --> 04:05:29,310
Okay, I'll go right.

9783
04:05:30,750 --> 04:05:32,750
I'm going on the other side here.

9784
04:05:33,530 --> 04:05:34,010
Yeah.

9785
04:05:34,050 --> 04:05:34,930
They go left.

9786
04:05:35,090 --> 04:05:35,470
They go left.

9787
04:05:37,450 --> 04:05:37,930
Whee.

9788
04:05:39,930 --> 04:05:41,110
Okay, I got Carbun.

9789
04:05:42,610 --> 04:05:44,210
I got... um...

9790
04:05:44,210 --> 04:05:45,170
Alternator and...

9791
04:05:45,670 --> 04:05:46,110
2020.

9792
04:05:46,110 --> 04:05:46,990
Yeah, I have Alternator.

9793
04:05:47,370 --> 04:05:48,630
And Sentinel.

9794
04:05:49,330 --> 04:05:50,750
There should be here.

9795
04:05:51,690 --> 04:05:52,890
Wait, L-Star here.

9796
04:05:54,630 --> 04:05:55,350
Hey, Ditto.

9797
04:05:55,670 --> 04:05:56,350
Ditto here.

9798
04:05:56,670 --> 04:05:57,290
Yeah, I see them.

9799
04:05:57,310 --> 04:05:57,810
They come here.

9800
04:05:59,690 --> 04:06:00,530
I see them.

9801
04:06:00,570 --> 04:06:01,110
They walked across.

9802
04:06:01,270 --> 04:06:02,190
I'm behind them.

9803
04:06:02,670 --> 04:06:03,330
They're running.

9804
04:06:03,410 --> 04:06:04,190
They're running to you guys.

9805
04:06:04,490 --> 04:06:05,530
I'm right behind them.

9806
04:06:06,590 --> 04:06:07,030
One.

9807
04:06:07,030 --> 04:06:07,510
One guy.

9808
04:06:08,110 --> 04:06:09,290
Oh wait, I have to...

9809
04:06:09,290 --> 04:06:11,190
I have to pull back.

9810
04:06:11,890 --> 04:06:12,330
Okay.

9811
04:06:12,510 --> 04:06:13,790
Yeah, they're looking at you.

9812
04:06:14,730 --> 04:06:15,050
Okay.

9813
04:06:15,690 --> 04:06:16,130
Broke one?

9814
04:06:16,170 --> 04:06:16,590
I will go back.

9815
04:06:17,470 --> 04:06:18,910
Yeah, I'm right behind them.

9816
04:06:19,030 --> 04:06:19,630
I'm right behind them.

9817
04:06:21,150 --> 04:06:22,850
I can push them whenever you guys are ready.

9818
04:06:23,190 --> 04:06:24,530
They're gonna push.

9819
04:06:24,590 --> 04:06:24,970
They're pushing.

9820
04:06:24,990 --> 04:06:25,250
They're pushing.

9821
04:06:25,530 --> 04:06:26,890
I see them pushing.

9822
04:06:29,230 --> 04:06:30,690
One is still there though.

9823
04:06:31,930 --> 04:06:32,590
Yeah, they're pushing.

9824
04:06:34,210 --> 04:06:34,890
I got the bat.

9825
04:06:35,030 --> 04:06:35,970
Okay, shoot my drone.

9826
04:06:36,990 --> 04:06:37,550
Be careful.

9827
04:06:37,950 --> 04:06:38,370
On me.

9828
04:06:38,390 --> 04:06:38,690
On me.

9829
04:06:38,690 --> 04:06:38,770
On me.

9830
04:06:38,770 --> 04:06:38,910
On me.

9831
04:06:39,030 --> 04:06:39,770
They're looking at me.

9832
04:06:39,790 --> 04:06:40,370
They're looking at me now.

9833
04:06:41,530 --> 04:06:42,270
Yeah, they're looking at me.

9834
04:06:42,310 --> 04:06:42,890
They're all looking at me.

9835
04:06:42,930 --> 04:06:43,590
I need you guys to help.

9836
04:06:45,530 --> 04:06:45,970
No!

9837
04:06:46,110 --> 04:06:46,950
He's flashed.

9838
04:06:47,330 --> 04:06:48,230
Oh my god.

9839
04:06:48,510 --> 04:06:49,290
I can't.

9840
04:06:49,290 --> 04:06:50,010
I can't push.

9841
04:06:50,310 --> 04:06:51,790
They both looked at me.

9842
04:06:52,410 --> 04:06:53,170
Oh, I'm rolling.

9843
04:06:53,390 --> 04:06:55,970
I can't push because there's one way I can't.

9844
04:06:56,170 --> 04:06:57,170
Wait, I can't ditto.

9845
04:06:57,390 --> 04:06:58,970
I think you guys should just craft me.

9846
04:06:59,110 --> 04:06:59,750
Yeah, just fall back.

9847
04:06:59,850 --> 04:07:03,010
I didn't realize they both were gonna turn around and look at me.

9848
04:07:03,530 --> 04:07:04,630
That was my bad.

9849
04:07:07,030 --> 04:07:08,990
Only one guy pushed up to you guys.

9850
04:07:09,030 --> 04:07:10,310
The other two were on me.

9851
04:07:11,590 --> 04:07:12,030
Yeah.

9852
04:07:12,030 --> 04:07:17,510
Yeah, because there was one guy looking at us.

9853
04:07:17,890 --> 04:07:18,470
Yeah.

9854
04:07:18,750 --> 04:07:19,790
How dare they.

9855
04:07:19,950 --> 04:07:21,470
I need to remember I'm lifeline.

9856
04:07:21,710 --> 04:07:22,690
I can't flank.

9857
04:07:25,130 --> 04:07:26,770
Lifeline can't flank.

9858
04:07:30,090 --> 04:07:32,170
I'm too... I'm baby.

9859
04:07:32,210 --> 04:07:33,970
I think I can actually craft her.

9860
04:07:34,090 --> 04:07:34,750
Should I craft her?

9861
04:07:34,810 --> 04:07:35,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9862
04:07:35,780 --> 04:07:36,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9863
04:07:37,800 --> 04:07:38,470
Yeah, yeah, do it.

9864
04:07:38,530 --> 04:07:39,670
This team is fighting here.

9865
04:07:39,670 --> 04:07:40,650
They won't know.

9866
04:07:40,970 --> 04:07:40,970
Okay.

9867
04:07:42,270 --> 04:07:43,210
Okay, they won't know.

9868
04:07:43,210 --> 04:07:43,770
Yeah, they won't know.

9869
04:07:43,810 --> 04:07:46,550
You can rez me right here and then we can third party this team.

9870
04:07:49,130 --> 04:07:49,530
Here.

9871
04:07:49,610 --> 04:07:50,930
Oh, you are brave for that.

9872
04:07:51,010 --> 04:07:51,690
You are so brave.

9873
04:07:51,690 --> 04:07:52,910
I was trying to get you guys.

9874
04:07:54,790 --> 04:07:55,790
Alright, we're rezzing.

9875
04:07:57,430 --> 04:07:59,130
I'm too squishy to flank.

9876
04:08:00,450 --> 04:08:02,490
I'm a little squishy lifeline.

9877
04:08:03,310 --> 04:08:04,550
I actually don't know where they're fighting.

9878
04:08:04,810 --> 04:08:05,630
Where did you see the fight?

9879
04:08:06,350 --> 04:08:07,670
I'm not sure, actually.

9880
04:08:07,750 --> 04:08:09,390
I heard them fighting, but like...

9881
04:08:09,670 --> 04:08:10,070
It ended.

9882
04:08:10,510 --> 04:08:12,730
There's one team went to the guy.

9883
04:08:13,910 --> 04:08:14,350
Oh.

9884
04:08:14,350 --> 04:08:16,570
There might be a lot of team over there.

9885
04:08:17,250 --> 04:08:18,130
In Skyhook.

9886
04:08:18,690 --> 04:08:20,390
I have no idea where the team is though.

9887
04:08:21,030 --> 04:08:21,670
I'll scan.

9888
04:08:21,890 --> 04:08:21,970
I'm looking around.

9889
04:08:22,190 --> 04:08:22,610
Yeah.

9890
04:08:23,510 --> 04:08:24,230
Let me see.

9891
04:08:24,310 --> 04:08:24,790
Oh, they...

9892
04:08:25,610 --> 04:08:27,330
They're fighting at the Bloodhound.

9893
04:08:27,750 --> 04:08:28,950
Oh, they're fighting there.

9894
04:08:29,050 --> 04:08:29,690
So this is safe.

9895
04:08:29,830 --> 04:08:31,050
Yeah, Bloodhound's powers.

9896
04:08:31,390 --> 04:08:32,450
Is this place safe then?

9897
04:08:33,010 --> 04:08:33,670
Yeah, it's safe.

9898
04:08:33,930 --> 04:08:35,530
Okay, I'm gonna go to the middle then.

9899
04:08:37,570 --> 04:08:38,010
Oh.

9900
04:08:38,450 --> 04:08:39,170
I know this one.

9901
04:08:39,290 --> 04:08:39,650
Nice.

9902
04:08:39,670 --> 04:08:40,850
Where did you knock them?

9903
04:08:41,210 --> 04:08:41,790
You can do it.

9904
04:08:43,110 --> 04:08:44,250
Ditto, where did you knock them?

9905
04:08:45,490 --> 04:08:46,450
I think she's like...

9906
04:08:46,450 --> 04:08:47,050
On me.

9907
04:08:47,370 --> 04:08:47,910
Oh, okay.

9908
04:08:47,970 --> 04:08:48,530
We can go to her.

9909
04:08:48,570 --> 04:08:49,190
Let's just go to her.

9910
04:08:49,950 --> 04:08:50,310
Okay.

9911
04:08:51,550 --> 04:08:52,450
I'm heading over now.

9912
04:08:52,730 --> 04:08:53,330
I'm sliding.

9913
04:08:53,630 --> 04:08:53,870
Yeah.

9914
04:08:53,950 --> 04:08:55,970
Oh, I'm gonna grab the Evil Harvester for us.

9915
04:08:56,010 --> 04:08:56,430
Oh, never mind.

9916
04:08:56,470 --> 04:08:56,890
We don't need it.

9917
04:08:57,090 --> 04:08:57,450
Wait.

9918
04:08:58,350 --> 04:08:59,770
That's a bit dangerous.

9919
04:09:00,010 --> 04:09:01,150
Ditto, you're in the middle.

9920
04:09:01,290 --> 04:09:01,630
Okay.

9921
04:09:02,130 --> 04:09:03,150
I'll go back.

9922
04:09:03,770 --> 04:09:04,490
Okay, okay.

9923
04:09:04,710 --> 04:09:04,970
Yeah.

9924
04:09:05,290 --> 04:09:05,990
We're here though.

9925
04:09:06,910 --> 04:09:07,890
Yeah, they're over here.

9926
04:09:07,950 --> 04:09:08,330
They're over here.

9927
04:09:08,370 --> 04:09:08,830
I see them.

9928
04:09:09,310 --> 04:09:09,770
Okay.

9929
04:09:11,670 --> 04:09:12,830
One's in this house.

9930
04:09:12,850 --> 04:09:13,550
One's in this house.

9931
04:09:14,150 --> 04:09:14,610
Okay.

9932
04:09:17,510 --> 04:09:20,010
I think we'll get squished.

9933
04:09:20,370 --> 04:09:22,690
I think we can go that way.

9934
04:09:23,150 --> 04:09:23,470
Yeah.

9935
04:09:23,650 --> 04:09:24,110
Yeah.

9936
04:09:24,230 --> 04:09:25,390
I scanned out somebody.

9937
04:09:25,650 --> 04:09:26,210
They're there.

9938
04:09:26,770 --> 04:09:27,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9939
04:09:27,430 --> 04:09:28,330
I saw that guy.

9940
04:09:28,350 --> 04:09:28,410
Over there.

9941
04:09:28,630 --> 04:09:28,750
Yeah.

9942
04:09:30,110 --> 04:09:30,570
Oh.

9943
04:09:30,570 --> 04:09:31,950
They Bloodhound ulted me.

9944
04:09:33,830 --> 04:09:35,150
I'm gonna try and heal.

9945
04:09:35,250 --> 04:09:35,570
Pull back.

9946
04:09:35,630 --> 04:09:35,790
Pull back.

9947
04:09:35,830 --> 04:09:36,130
I'm falling.

9948
04:09:36,430 --> 04:09:36,710
I'm falling.

9949
04:09:36,730 --> 04:09:36,970
I'm falling.

9950
04:09:37,250 --> 04:09:37,570
Back.

9951
04:09:37,710 --> 04:09:38,050
I'm falling back.

9952
04:09:39,130 --> 04:09:39,550
I'm okay.

9953
04:09:39,730 --> 04:09:40,710
They have a blue armor.

9954
04:09:41,310 --> 04:09:41,870
Yeah, I'm okay.

9955
04:09:41,990 --> 04:09:42,650
Oh my god!

9956
04:09:42,690 --> 04:09:43,550
That's a gold longbow!

9957
04:09:43,750 --> 04:09:44,670
Guys, I'm gonna get that.

9958
04:09:45,190 --> 04:09:45,510
Okay.

9959
04:09:45,730 --> 04:09:46,910
I need that, guys.

9960
04:09:47,970 --> 04:09:49,150
Guys, you don't understand.

9961
04:09:49,570 --> 04:09:50,270
Do you have any bats?

9962
04:09:50,490 --> 04:09:51,910
I have five bats.

9963
04:09:52,830 --> 04:09:53,490
Yeah, I do.

9964
04:09:53,530 --> 04:09:54,150
I don't have bats.

9965
04:09:54,250 --> 04:09:57,550
Guys, I haven't... I've been trying to get a gold longbow for so long.

9966
04:09:57,670 --> 04:09:57,690
Okay.

9967
04:09:57,690 --> 04:09:58,510
I'll give you two here.

9968
04:09:58,790 --> 04:09:59,110
Really?

9969
04:09:59,410 --> 04:09:59,730
Yeah.

9970
04:10:00,810 --> 04:10:05,710
When... that moment when I got that first gold longbow and then I died because of the flank.

9971
04:10:06,250 --> 04:10:07,850
It made me so sad.

9972
04:10:08,550 --> 04:10:09,010
They might...

9973
04:10:09,670 --> 04:10:10,830
They might come to us.

9974
04:10:11,490 --> 04:10:11,850
Okay.

9975
04:10:12,050 --> 04:10:12,970
They'll pass by the team.

9976
04:10:13,070 --> 04:10:14,310
Vito and I are really far, by the way.

9977
04:10:14,310 --> 04:10:14,870
Yeah, they come to us.

9978
04:10:14,970 --> 04:10:15,390
They come to us.

9979
04:10:16,910 --> 04:10:17,450
We're far.

9980
04:10:17,950 --> 04:10:18,990
Do you want us to come here?

9981
04:10:19,170 --> 04:10:19,910
Wait, there's one here?

9982
04:10:20,770 --> 04:10:21,050
Yeah.

9983
04:10:21,110 --> 04:10:22,010
There's one in the tunnel.

9984
04:10:22,250 --> 04:10:23,110
There's one in the tunnel.

9985
04:10:23,350 --> 04:10:24,110
Oh, okay.

9986
04:10:24,210 --> 04:10:24,670
I'm heading back.

9987
04:10:24,850 --> 04:10:25,370
I'm heading back.

9988
04:10:25,590 --> 04:10:26,390
I'm going up the house.

9989
04:10:26,410 --> 04:10:27,010
Yeah, go to the door.

9990
04:10:27,010 --> 04:10:27,510
Go to the door.

9991
04:10:27,630 --> 04:10:28,090
Oh, shit!

9992
04:10:28,230 --> 04:10:28,610
You have one.

9993
04:10:28,850 --> 04:10:29,510
Almost got one.

9994
04:10:29,730 --> 04:10:30,450
Every time.

9995
04:10:30,830 --> 04:10:31,410
Ditto, Ditto.

9996
04:10:31,550 --> 04:10:32,150
Someone behind.

9997
04:10:32,590 --> 04:10:33,110
Yeah, Ditto.

9998
04:10:33,170 --> 04:10:33,550
We need help.

9999
04:10:33,610 --> 04:10:34,110
We need help, Ditto.

10000
04:10:35,110 --> 04:10:35,710
Okay, okay.

10001
04:10:35,950 --> 04:10:36,750
Here, here, here, here.

10002
04:10:38,310 --> 04:10:39,450
I'm like stuck here too.

10003
04:10:40,630 --> 04:10:41,890
I'm gonna... I almost hit one.

10004
04:10:41,910 --> 04:10:42,370
I hit one.

10005
04:10:45,410 --> 04:10:46,830
He's one behind this car.

10006
04:10:47,570 --> 04:10:48,390
The car, yeah.

10007
04:10:50,250 --> 04:10:51,150
Someone on top.

10008
04:10:52,990 --> 04:10:53,910
There's someone on top.

10009
04:10:54,150 --> 04:10:54,150
There's someone on top.

10010
04:10:54,650 --> 04:10:56,550
We have to go to Doki... Doki place.

10011
04:10:57,510 --> 04:10:58,170
Yeah, come here.

10012
04:10:58,450 --> 04:10:58,490
Kill.

10013
04:10:59,730 --> 04:10:59,970
Come to me.

10014
04:11:00,010 --> 04:11:00,610
Come to me.

10015
04:11:00,650 --> 04:11:02,370
I need help.

10016
04:11:02,470 --> 04:11:02,870
I need help.

10017
04:11:03,410 --> 04:11:04,690
Yeah, I'm trying to cover.

10018
04:11:04,810 --> 04:11:05,410
Oh, I can't.

10019
04:11:05,710 --> 04:11:06,350
I can't.

10020
04:11:06,350 --> 04:11:06,850
I can't cover.

10021
04:11:07,190 --> 04:11:07,790
I can't.

10022
04:11:08,810 --> 04:11:09,630
There's two teams.

10023
04:11:09,710 --> 04:11:10,010
Wait, wait.

10024
04:11:10,030 --> 04:11:11,350
You can actually get me, I think.

10025
04:11:11,890 --> 04:11:12,610
I got one.

10026
04:11:12,610 --> 04:11:13,050
I got one.

10027
04:11:13,070 --> 04:11:14,070
Yeah, I'm gonna...

10028
04:11:14,070 --> 04:11:14,630
I'm gonna rest.

10029
04:11:14,990 --> 04:11:15,450
Okay, okay.

10030
04:11:15,590 --> 04:11:16,530
Okay, you're okay.

10031
04:11:16,570 --> 04:11:16,750
You go.

10032
04:11:16,810 --> 04:11:17,070
Yeah.

10033
04:11:19,010 --> 04:11:19,330
Nice.

10034
04:11:20,810 --> 04:11:21,770
Oh, my god.

10035
04:11:21,910 --> 04:11:22,350
Do you have a Q?

10036
04:11:22,970 --> 04:11:23,410
Yeah, I do.

10037
04:11:23,470 --> 04:11:23,790
Come here.

10038
04:11:23,830 --> 04:11:24,010
Come here.

10039
04:11:24,210 --> 04:11:24,690
Come inside.

10040
04:11:24,750 --> 04:11:24,970
Come inside.

10041
04:11:25,750 --> 04:11:26,250
Wait, wait.

10042
04:11:26,250 --> 04:11:27,070
There's a grenade.

10043
04:11:29,050 --> 04:11:29,690
Come inside.

10044
04:11:30,450 --> 04:11:31,050
I'm pushing.

10045
04:11:31,070 --> 04:11:32,210
The Q is out here.

10046
04:11:32,390 --> 04:11:33,070
We can't go.

10047
04:11:33,190 --> 04:11:33,950
We can't go third.

10048
04:11:34,270 --> 04:11:34,830
They're fighting.

10049
04:11:35,050 --> 04:11:35,230
Yeah.

10050
04:11:35,270 --> 04:11:35,690
I got one.

10051
04:11:35,690 --> 04:11:36,130
I got another.

10052
04:11:36,350 --> 04:11:36,870
I got another.

10053
04:11:37,130 --> 04:11:37,870
I got another.

10054
04:11:37,870 --> 04:11:38,190
I got third.

10055
04:11:38,270 --> 04:11:38,610
I got third.

10056
04:11:39,110 --> 04:11:40,350
I'm just gonna snipe here.

10057
04:11:40,410 --> 04:11:41,030
I'm just gonna snipe.

10058
04:11:41,090 --> 04:11:41,670
Because I have gold.

10059
04:11:42,070 --> 04:11:42,390
Okay.

10060
04:11:43,970 --> 04:11:44,630
I'm gonna ditto.

10061
04:11:45,030 --> 04:11:45,350
Okay.

10062
04:11:45,450 --> 04:11:45,990
I got the bat.

10063
04:11:46,050 --> 04:11:46,410
I got the bat.

10064
04:11:46,790 --> 04:11:47,270
Two teams.

10065
04:11:47,390 --> 04:11:47,550
Yes.

10066
04:11:47,550 --> 04:11:47,890
Two teams.

10067
04:11:48,090 --> 04:11:48,750
I'm covering.

10068
04:11:48,890 --> 04:11:49,210
I'm covering.

10069
04:11:49,990 --> 04:11:52,190
Yeah, I'm just sniping from outside.

10070
04:11:53,110 --> 04:11:53,630
Pass through there.

10071
04:11:53,630 --> 04:11:54,090
Pass through there.

10072
04:11:54,090 --> 04:11:56,270
I have no idea where they are.

10073
04:11:56,330 --> 04:11:56,990
I knocked two.

10074
04:11:58,190 --> 04:11:58,990
They are racing.

10075
04:11:59,630 --> 04:12:01,210
Yeah, I think they are playing inside now.

10076
04:12:03,510 --> 04:12:04,390
They are playing inside.

10077
04:12:05,370 --> 04:12:06,090
Oh no!

10078
04:12:06,350 --> 04:12:07,290
He is still low.

10079
04:12:07,490 --> 04:12:08,570
He is still low.

10080
04:12:08,690 --> 04:12:08,730
Okay.

10081
04:12:09,050 --> 04:12:10,090
I'm going to try and come here guys.

10082
04:12:10,550 --> 04:12:11,090
No, no, no.

10083
04:12:11,270 --> 04:12:11,770
You have to...

10084
04:12:11,770 --> 04:12:12,450
No, no.

10085
04:12:12,710 --> 04:12:13,630
I can't come inside.

10086
04:12:13,750 --> 04:12:14,510
I can't come inside.

10087
04:12:14,590 --> 04:12:15,090
There is a...

10088
04:12:15,090 --> 04:12:16,210
Oh my gosh!

10089
04:12:16,470 --> 04:12:17,630
I couldn't come inside because they...

10090
04:12:17,630 --> 04:12:18,330
I think you got to have them.

10091
04:12:18,850 --> 04:12:20,110
Two, two, two.

10092
04:12:20,490 --> 04:12:21,210
They have two.

10093
04:12:21,210 --> 04:12:21,650
They have two.

10094
04:12:21,650 --> 04:12:21,970
There is two.

10095
04:12:22,510 --> 04:12:22,970
It's fine.

10096
04:12:23,070 --> 04:12:23,970
I can craft you here too.

10097
04:12:24,570 --> 04:12:24,970
Okay.

10098
04:12:24,970 --> 04:12:26,510
You can come later.

10099
04:12:29,190 --> 04:12:29,590
Goodbye.

10100
04:12:33,190 --> 04:12:33,910
Oh my gosh!

10101
04:12:33,990 --> 04:12:34,590
The harvok!

10102
04:12:35,010 --> 04:12:36,610
The harvok is really great.

10103
04:12:37,170 --> 04:12:37,570
Yeah.

10104
04:12:37,630 --> 04:12:38,710
Didn't you say it was trash?

10105
04:12:38,750 --> 04:12:39,910
You said it was trash.

10106
04:12:40,710 --> 04:12:41,670
No, no, no.

10107
04:12:42,030 --> 04:12:43,050
If you are...

10108
04:12:43,050 --> 04:12:43,130
Wait.

10109
04:12:43,250 --> 04:12:45,170
This guy hit all headshot on me though.

10110
04:12:45,310 --> 04:12:45,690
On the harvok.

10111
04:12:46,010 --> 04:12:46,790
Oh, the hair is scary.

10112
04:12:47,290 --> 04:12:48,030
Oh, that's scary.

10113
04:12:48,050 --> 04:12:48,450
Yeah.

10114
04:12:48,470 --> 04:12:51,630
He did 188 headshot by the...

10115
04:12:51,650 --> 04:12:52,370
He walked so fast.

10116
04:12:52,610 --> 04:12:52,890
Yeah.

10117
04:12:52,990 --> 04:12:53,930
I think he could be a cheater.

10118
04:12:54,030 --> 04:12:54,250
Yes.

10119
04:12:55,430 --> 04:12:57,130
I'm a bit scared of that one.

10120
04:12:57,150 --> 04:12:57,510
Yeah.

10121
04:12:57,510 --> 04:12:58,630
I'm going to leave now.

10122
04:12:59,050 --> 04:12:59,690
I'm going to...

10123
04:12:59,690 --> 04:13:00,510
I couldn't come inside.

10124
04:13:00,530 --> 04:13:03,410
The catalyst locked the doors.

10125
04:13:04,230 --> 04:13:05,650
So I couldn't go in.

10126
04:13:05,930 --> 04:13:06,830
I was like, no.

10127
04:13:07,590 --> 04:13:08,710
I'm so far away.

10128
04:13:09,130 --> 04:13:09,450
Oh yeah.

10129
04:13:09,490 --> 04:13:09,830
You can...

10130
04:13:09,830 --> 04:13:10,450
You can...

10131
04:13:10,450 --> 04:13:11,390
Oh, be careful.

10132
04:13:11,530 --> 04:13:12,370
Be careful right side.

10133
04:13:12,730 --> 04:13:13,570
You can...

10134
04:13:14,090 --> 04:13:14,790
There is a tear.

10135
04:13:15,090 --> 04:13:15,530
Yeah.

10136
04:13:15,650 --> 04:13:16,690
Oh, I see that.

10137
04:13:16,730 --> 04:13:17,330
Did you guys see that?

10138
04:13:17,390 --> 04:13:17,850
There is...

10139
04:13:18,350 --> 04:13:18,570
Yeah.

10140
04:13:18,630 --> 04:13:19,010
I see that.

10141
04:13:19,030 --> 04:13:19,230
Oh!

10142
04:13:19,470 --> 04:13:19,910
Oh!

10143
04:13:20,070 --> 04:13:20,810
They fly away.

10144
04:13:20,810 --> 04:13:21,370
They fly away.

10145
04:13:21,550 --> 04:13:21,630
They fly away.

10146
04:13:21,650 --> 04:13:22,270
Oh, not yet!

10147
04:13:25,810 --> 04:13:26,290
It's okay.

10148
04:13:26,430 --> 04:13:27,090
There's no one.

10149
04:13:27,170 --> 04:13:27,790
There's no one.

10150
04:13:27,910 --> 04:13:28,130
No!

10151
04:13:28,130 --> 04:13:28,170
That's not.

10152
04:13:29,650 --> 04:13:29,970
That's us!

10153
04:13:30,650 --> 04:13:30,970
That!

10154
04:13:31,290 --> 04:13:32,390
Oh, they just fell.

10155
04:13:32,550 --> 04:13:32,890
Oh, no.

10156
04:13:32,890 --> 04:13:33,010
No.

10157
04:13:33,010 --> 04:13:33,770
Doggy is...

10158
04:13:33,770 --> 04:13:34,770
Oh, my god.

10159
04:13:34,850 --> 04:13:36,410
It's very... It's very close.

10160
04:13:37,610 --> 04:13:37,930
That's...

10161
04:13:38,270 --> 04:13:39,170
Oh, my god.

10162
04:13:39,230 --> 04:13:40,510
Oh, they're fighting different team?

10163
04:13:41,050 --> 04:13:41,370
No.

10164
04:13:41,430 --> 04:13:41,690
No.

10165
04:13:42,110 --> 04:13:43,490
I think he was trying to shoot me.

10166
04:13:43,550 --> 04:13:44,630
I think he was trying to shoot me.

10167
04:13:44,630 --> 04:13:44,730
No.

10168
04:13:44,730 --> 04:13:44,890
No.

10169
04:13:44,910 --> 04:13:46,290
I think he was fighting different team.

10170
04:13:46,430 --> 04:13:46,670
No.

10171
04:13:46,690 --> 04:13:47,450
I'm just going to rest you here.

10172
04:13:47,530 --> 04:13:48,110
I'm going to rest you here.

10173
04:13:48,170 --> 04:13:48,930
I'm going to rest you here.

10174
04:13:49,150 --> 04:13:49,470
Okay.

10175
04:13:49,470 --> 04:13:49,630
Okay.

10176
04:13:49,690 --> 04:13:51,930
It's still... it's still... um...

10177
04:13:52,470 --> 04:13:53,330
...a ring to.

10178
04:13:53,630 --> 04:13:56,970
Yeah, I can't believe Ditto lied to us again.

10179
04:13:57,910 --> 04:13:59,790
There's nobody there!

10180
04:14:00,030 --> 04:14:01,470
I didn't see anyone.

10181
04:14:02,230 --> 04:14:04,290
Okay, okay, Ditto.

10182
04:14:04,290 --> 04:14:04,990
I didn't see anyone.

10183
04:14:05,610 --> 04:14:07,230
Okay, then...

10184
04:14:08,290 --> 04:14:10,070
There's no one there.

10185
04:14:10,930 --> 04:14:11,610
Really?

10186
04:14:11,950 --> 04:14:12,270
Really?

10187
04:14:12,550 --> 04:14:13,490
I didn't see anyone.

10188
04:14:16,150 --> 04:14:19,470
That was the scariest fucking...

10189
04:14:20,670 --> 04:14:23,290
I literally had to walk to the left.

10190
04:14:23,550 --> 04:14:25,570
She did it to me before.

10191
04:14:26,530 --> 04:14:27,550
I didn't know.

10192
04:14:27,870 --> 04:14:28,670
I don't know what you're talking about.

10193
04:14:28,790 --> 04:14:29,430
I would never.

10194
04:14:29,690 --> 04:14:31,030
I am a team player.

10195
04:14:33,830 --> 04:14:35,170
I'm a team player.

10196
04:14:35,350 --> 04:14:35,870
I would never.

10197
04:14:36,410 --> 04:14:38,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

10198
04:14:39,950 --> 04:14:42,230
I would never gaslit my teammates.

10199
04:14:45,670 --> 04:14:46,470
You're lying.

10200
04:14:46,990 --> 04:14:47,830
You're lying.

10201
04:14:48,170 --> 04:14:49,230
Why would I lie?

10202
04:14:49,270 --> 04:14:49,710
What the heck?

10203
04:14:50,510 --> 04:14:51,270
I'm just gonna die.

10204
04:14:51,370 --> 04:14:51,650
Okay.

10205
04:14:51,670 --> 04:14:53,270
I have gold red shield.

10206
04:14:53,530 --> 04:14:53,930
Just come to me.

10207
04:14:54,010 --> 04:14:54,630
But like...

10208
04:14:54,630 --> 04:14:55,490
Okay.

10209
04:14:57,210 --> 04:14:57,650
Okay.

10210
04:14:57,910 --> 04:14:58,950
Yeah, I have gold red shield.

10211
04:14:59,130 --> 04:15:00,590
Okay, you're gonna last me?

10212
04:15:00,830 --> 04:15:01,170
Yeah.

10213
04:15:01,750 --> 04:15:02,390
I'm crafting.

10214
04:15:02,810 --> 04:15:03,950
You're gonna craft?

10215
04:15:05,750 --> 04:15:06,450
Last me?

10216
04:15:07,330 --> 04:15:08,210
What the heck?

10217
04:15:08,230 --> 04:15:08,790
Oh my god.

10218
04:15:08,830 --> 04:15:09,270
You're there.

10219
04:15:09,270 --> 04:15:09,290
You're there.

10220
04:15:09,870 --> 04:15:10,990
Oh my god!

10221
04:15:11,050 --> 04:15:12,410
Why the fuck are you guys...

10222
04:15:13,490 --> 04:15:15,950
Guys, I don't have a lot of heals either!

10223
04:15:18,330 --> 04:15:20,110
They're not decamping us though.

10224
04:15:22,250 --> 04:15:25,670
We have to go to... um... tunnel?

10225
04:15:26,670 --> 04:15:28,270
Going... to a tunnel?

10226
04:15:28,450 --> 04:15:28,810
A tunnel?

10227
04:15:29,090 --> 04:15:33,330
Okay, I have two syringes left.

10228
04:15:35,510 --> 04:15:36,070
Okay.

10229
04:15:36,070 --> 04:15:36,730
It's okay.

10230
04:15:37,450 --> 04:15:38,590
You guys go.

10231
04:15:38,790 --> 04:15:40,090
I'll try and go separate.

10232
04:15:40,310 --> 04:15:40,550
Okay.

10233
04:15:40,550 --> 04:15:41,470
And see if they...

10234
04:15:43,770 --> 04:15:45,430
I'm also gonna craft a medkit.

10235
04:15:48,510 --> 04:15:48,910
Okay.

10236
04:15:49,030 --> 04:15:49,290
Oh god.

10237
04:15:50,730 --> 04:15:52,110
They're shooting me, so it's okay.

10238
04:15:52,170 --> 04:15:53,630
I think I might die.

10239
04:15:54,710 --> 04:15:56,050
Please, you're so far.

10240
04:15:56,370 --> 04:15:58,230
Ditto, I can't pick you up there.

10241
04:15:59,330 --> 04:15:59,850
It's okay.

10242
04:15:59,930 --> 04:16:00,390
I'm safe.

10243
04:16:00,870 --> 04:16:01,270
Okay?

10244
04:16:02,030 --> 04:16:04,530
If I'm lucky, I will survive.

10245
04:16:04,650 --> 04:16:05,630
You have to come to me then.

10246
04:16:05,630 --> 04:16:06,570
Oh no, I'm not lucky.

10247
04:16:06,810 --> 04:16:07,610
I'm not lucky.

10248
04:16:07,870 --> 04:16:08,230
Why?

10249
04:16:08,250 --> 04:16:08,430
Why?

10250
04:16:08,450 --> 04:16:08,630
Why?

10251
04:16:08,630 --> 04:16:09,150
Where did you go?

10252
04:16:09,150 --> 04:16:09,630
Where did you go?

10253
04:16:10,310 --> 04:16:11,390
Okay, oh, I will come to you.

10254
04:16:11,510 --> 04:16:12,030
I will go to you.

10255
04:16:12,270 --> 04:16:12,270
Come to me.

10256
04:16:12,290 --> 04:16:12,570
Come to me.

10257
04:16:12,730 --> 04:16:12,910
Come to me.

10258
04:16:16,490 --> 04:16:17,410
Kido's alive too.

10259
04:16:18,590 --> 04:16:19,090
I'm alive.

10260
04:16:19,090 --> 04:16:19,590
I'm going.

10261
04:16:19,870 --> 04:16:20,650
What the heck?

10262
04:16:20,850 --> 04:16:22,050
There's no sign in here.

10263
04:16:24,710 --> 04:16:25,030
Okay.

10264
04:16:25,910 --> 04:16:26,230
Hello.

10265
04:16:27,550 --> 04:16:29,050
You have to come to me if you want heals.

10266
04:16:29,430 --> 04:16:29,610
Why?

10267
04:16:29,610 --> 04:16:30,370
There's no heal.

10268
04:16:30,670 --> 04:16:31,390
You have to come to me.

10269
04:16:31,850 --> 04:16:32,870
There's heals right here.

10270
04:16:32,930 --> 04:16:33,530
I'm trying.

10271
04:16:33,610 --> 04:16:33,970
I'm trying.

10272
04:16:34,130 --> 04:16:34,410
I'm trying.

10273
04:16:34,410 --> 04:16:34,750
I'm trying.

10274
04:16:34,770 --> 04:16:34,910
Heals right here.

10275
04:16:34,990 --> 04:16:35,770
You have to come to me.

10276
04:16:35,830 --> 04:16:36,030
Oh.

10277
04:16:37,190 --> 04:16:37,890
Oh, raise me.

10278
04:16:37,930 --> 04:16:38,450
Raise me.

10279
04:16:38,450 --> 04:16:39,370
Oh, I'm leaving.

10280
04:16:40,650 --> 04:16:41,130
Goodbye.

10281
04:16:42,610 --> 04:16:43,450
Okay, we go.

10282
04:16:43,530 --> 04:16:43,870
We go.

10283
04:16:43,870 --> 04:16:44,190
We go.

10284
04:16:44,250 --> 04:16:44,490
We go.

10285
04:16:44,570 --> 04:16:45,890
I think we're gonna die, Hiro.

10286
04:16:46,210 --> 04:16:48,010
I think I'm gonna die.

10287
04:16:48,630 --> 04:16:50,370
There's people right in front of me.

10288
04:16:51,390 --> 04:16:52,970
There's no other place to go.

10289
04:16:57,610 --> 04:16:58,790
We have to fight.

10290
04:16:58,970 --> 04:16:59,790
We have to fight.

10291
04:17:02,290 --> 04:17:04,270
I will go on top.

10292
04:17:04,350 --> 04:17:04,750
I will go top.

10293
04:17:05,470 --> 04:17:07,590
There's three squads here.

10294
04:17:08,730 --> 04:17:10,190
Bang a little monster tank.

10295
04:17:10,610 --> 04:17:11,530
Be a little less.

10296
04:17:12,370 --> 04:17:13,210
I got bang.

10297
04:17:16,150 --> 04:17:17,290
One monster tank.

10298
04:17:18,350 --> 04:17:19,070
Oh, God.

10299
04:17:21,110 --> 04:17:21,850
Oh, God.

10300
04:17:24,090 --> 04:17:25,130
Oh, please.

10301
04:17:25,330 --> 04:17:25,710
No.

10302
04:17:26,930 --> 04:17:28,230
You're gonna die.

10303
04:17:31,970 --> 04:17:32,730
Oh, God.

10304
04:17:32,730 --> 04:17:33,170
I'm dead.

10305
04:17:33,270 --> 04:17:33,790
I'm dead.

10306
04:17:34,490 --> 04:17:35,490
Oh, my God.

10307
04:17:35,490 --> 04:17:35,850
I'm dead.

10308
04:17:35,910 --> 04:17:36,050
I'm dead.

10309
04:17:36,050 --> 04:17:36,270
No, live.

10310
04:17:36,490 --> 04:17:37,010
Live.

10311
04:17:37,050 --> 04:17:37,570
Live.

10312
04:17:37,570 --> 04:17:38,610
Is there a prison here?

10313
04:17:38,710 --> 04:17:39,610
You have to live.

10314
04:17:39,670 --> 04:17:39,990
Live.

10315
04:17:40,090 --> 04:17:40,610
Live.

10316
04:17:40,950 --> 04:17:40,950
Live.

10317
04:17:40,950 --> 04:17:54,270
There is no other place to die.

10318
04:18:12,360 --> 04:18:12,380
Quiet.

10319
04:18:12,900 --> 04:18:13,340
Oh no!

10320
04:18:14,480 --> 04:18:15,620
I got scared!

10321
04:18:17,160 --> 04:18:18,040
Holy shit!

10322
04:18:18,420 --> 04:18:21,160
Bro, and then there's a- There's so many people!

10323
04:18:21,300 --> 04:18:22,140
What was that?

10324
04:18:22,200 --> 04:18:23,300
There's just so many people!

10325
04:18:23,860 --> 04:18:24,600
Holy shit.

10326
04:18:24,620 --> 04:18:25,900
Hey guys, I got plus 55.

10327
04:18:28,060 --> 04:18:29,400
No, I got plus 17!

10328
04:18:29,520 --> 04:18:30,820
I was looking at the wrong person!

10329
04:18:32,380 --> 04:18:33,020
Wait, what?

10330
04:18:33,160 --> 04:18:35,680
You could look at your RP in the ranked.

10331
04:18:36,640 --> 04:18:37,840
Oh yeah, we can.

10332
04:18:37,880 --> 04:18:38,260
Yeah, we could.

10333
04:18:38,260 --> 04:18:43,480
At least I got to use my longbow, guys.

10334
04:18:43,800 --> 04:18:44,600
I got to use it.

10335
04:18:44,600 --> 04:18:44,860
Did you?

10336
04:18:45,260 --> 04:18:45,960
Yay!

10337
04:18:46,500 --> 04:18:48,880
I used the longbow!

10338
04:18:49,000 --> 04:18:50,000
I'm so happy!

10339
04:18:53,140 --> 04:18:54,540
Holy shit.

10340
04:18:54,640 --> 04:18:56,160
Who would've thought?

10341
04:18:58,480 --> 04:19:00,060
Who would've thought?

10342
04:19:00,160 --> 04:19:02,180
There's so many squads there.

10343
04:19:02,380 --> 04:19:03,540
It's like impossible.

10344
04:19:04,940 --> 04:19:06,800
There were so many people.

10345
04:19:06,800 --> 04:19:08,740
And we had no heals.

10346
04:19:08,940 --> 04:19:10,660
We were broke, we were poor.

10347
04:19:11,640 --> 04:19:13,080
I had no heals.

10348
04:19:14,500 --> 04:19:15,260
I only had cells.

10349
04:19:15,260 --> 04:19:16,280
Yeah, I had no heals.

10350
04:19:17,500 --> 04:19:18,700
And they had blood!

10351
04:19:18,780 --> 04:19:19,300
We were so poor!

10352
04:19:20,680 --> 04:19:21,740
We were so poor.

10353
04:19:22,280 --> 04:19:24,080
We were crying.

10354
04:19:25,480 --> 04:19:26,860
Please, can someone donate...

10355
04:19:28,160 --> 04:19:29,400
...heals to us?

10356
04:19:29,760 --> 04:19:34,500
I wish, you know like, those games where you can get chat to help you and stuff?

10357
04:19:35,380 --> 04:19:36,780
Oh yeah, and like...

10358
04:19:36,780 --> 04:19:37,340
Twitch plays.

10359
04:19:37,340 --> 04:19:41,320
Like, they do like Twitch plays something and then they like send you stuff while you're playing.

10360
04:19:41,480 --> 04:19:42,360
Like the Hunger Games!

10361
04:19:42,420 --> 04:19:43,340
The tributes!

10362
04:19:43,520 --> 04:19:44,820
I wish we can get tributes.

10363
04:19:44,820 --> 04:19:45,200
Oh yeah!

10364
04:19:45,400 --> 04:19:46,480
Like, like sponsors.

10365
04:19:46,740 --> 04:19:47,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10366
04:19:48,360 --> 04:19:51,380
We play and the chat sends help kits to us.

10367
04:19:51,500 --> 04:19:54,220
Like, sends us tributes and sponsors.

10368
04:19:56,820 --> 04:19:58,740
Imagine you can sponsor like a Craver.

10369
04:19:59,080 --> 04:19:59,620
Yeah, yeah.

10370
04:20:00,300 --> 04:20:01,580
That should be a thing!

10371
04:20:01,800 --> 04:20:04,520
There should be chat integration in Apex.

10372
04:20:04,520 --> 04:20:06,540
That would make the game more alive!

10373
04:20:07,060 --> 04:20:08,700
One team, one team, one team.

10374
04:20:09,020 --> 04:20:09,240
Okay.

10375
04:20:09,880 --> 04:20:11,680
I'mma land here in the circle.

10376
04:20:11,700 --> 04:20:13,340
Okay, I'll go with Ditto here.

10377
04:20:14,440 --> 04:20:18,560
I wish Twitch can... I wish chat can sponsor us so we can get help kits.

10378
04:20:18,560 --> 04:20:20,080
One team, one team, one team.

10379
04:20:20,120 --> 04:20:20,640
I see them.

10380
04:20:20,660 --> 04:20:21,340
They're right over here.

10381
04:20:23,260 --> 04:20:23,700
Okay.

10382
04:20:25,780 --> 04:20:26,220
Okay.

10383
04:20:26,720 --> 04:20:27,380
Let's see.

10384
04:20:28,340 --> 04:20:29,180
Oh my god.

10385
04:20:29,200 --> 04:20:29,900
There's a triple take.

10386
04:20:29,940 --> 04:20:30,860
I'll grab the triple take.

10387
04:20:30,980 --> 04:20:31,200
Okay.

10388
04:20:33,500 --> 04:20:34,380
Oh my god.

10389
04:20:35,020 --> 04:20:35,580
They're here?

10390
04:20:35,700 --> 04:20:36,080
They're here?

10391
04:20:36,160 --> 04:20:36,480
They're there.

10392
04:20:37,860 --> 04:20:39,920
Is there any weapon I need?

10393
04:20:40,140 --> 04:20:40,940
Oh my god!

10394
04:20:41,100 --> 04:20:41,720
My gun!

10395
04:20:42,100 --> 04:20:42,520
There is.

10396
04:20:42,580 --> 04:20:44,560
My gun is like... Oh my god, my gun's stuck.

10397
04:20:44,960 --> 04:20:46,340
There's a lot of guns here.

10398
04:20:46,660 --> 04:20:49,280
Okay, okay, I got the beta gun.

10399
04:20:49,500 --> 04:20:50,540
There's alternators.

10400
04:20:51,060 --> 04:20:52,440
There's everything down here.

10401
04:20:53,140 --> 04:20:54,520
Yeah, I need a weapon.

10402
04:20:55,360 --> 04:20:56,720
There's so much stuff.

10403
04:20:58,740 --> 04:20:59,180
Okay.

10404
04:20:59,320 --> 04:21:00,260
Alright, I'm ready to fight.

10405
04:21:01,220 --> 04:21:01,980
Where are they?

10406
04:21:02,120 --> 04:21:03,060
Oh, I saw them over there.

10407
04:21:06,440 --> 04:21:08,480
I'm waiting for the scan before I push up.

10408
04:21:09,220 --> 04:21:11,160
Okay, I'm waiting for the scan too.

10409
04:21:13,200 --> 04:21:14,160
I'm not sure.

10410
04:21:14,460 --> 04:21:16,200
Oh, they have a crypto too.

10411
04:21:16,580 --> 04:21:17,440
They have a crypto.

10412
04:21:17,900 --> 04:21:19,120
Oh, they scan your drone?

10413
04:21:19,280 --> 04:21:20,320
Oh, I see them.

10414
04:21:21,140 --> 04:21:22,180
Oh, they're running too.

10415
04:21:22,380 --> 04:21:23,680
I grabbed them crypto over there.

10416
04:21:24,160 --> 04:21:25,160
Behind the container.

10417
04:21:25,500 --> 04:21:26,780
Okay, I'm pushing up.

10418
04:21:30,400 --> 04:21:31,700
They're like right here.

10419
04:21:32,340 --> 04:21:32,820
Whoa!

10420
04:21:33,200 --> 04:21:34,720
Wait, they also have a sniper.

10421
04:21:35,980 --> 04:21:37,100
But they're better at it than me.

10422
04:21:39,180 --> 04:21:40,420
I think they have a scope.

10423
04:21:41,620 --> 04:21:42,380
They're on the tower?

10424
04:21:44,140 --> 04:21:45,340
It's right on the tower.

10425
04:21:45,380 --> 04:21:45,880
I'll scan them.

10426
04:21:46,040 --> 04:21:46,300
Okay.

10427
04:21:47,820 --> 04:21:48,440
Let me check.

10428
04:21:49,340 --> 04:21:50,840
Wait, wait, wait.

10429
04:21:51,560 --> 04:21:52,540
Crypto's like here.

10430
04:21:53,100 --> 04:21:54,220
Alright, I'm pushing up then.

10431
04:21:54,360 --> 04:21:55,020
Wait, yeah, the crypto's close.

10432
04:21:55,020 --> 04:21:55,320
Here, I'm pushing up.

10433
04:21:55,500 --> 04:21:55,780
He's here.

10434
04:21:55,920 --> 04:21:56,160
He's here.

10435
04:21:56,580 --> 04:21:57,460
Oh, they scanned me.

10436
04:21:57,520 --> 04:21:58,060
They know I'm here now.

10437
04:21:59,820 --> 04:22:00,460
Here, here, here.

10438
04:22:01,700 --> 04:22:02,360
Oh, no.

10439
04:22:03,060 --> 04:22:04,420
Okay, okay, okay.

10440
04:22:04,460 --> 04:22:04,920
Got it?

10441
04:22:05,400 --> 04:22:06,100
I'm pushing up.

10442
04:22:06,720 --> 04:22:07,760
I'm selling, I'm selling.

10443
04:22:09,660 --> 04:22:10,440
Okay, I'm selling.

10444
04:22:11,140 --> 04:22:13,000
Oh, he has a massive...

10445
04:22:13,520 --> 04:22:14,600
Oh, I might be dead.

10446
04:22:16,620 --> 04:22:17,860
Oh, that's my bitch!

10447
04:22:17,880 --> 04:22:18,380
Okay, go, go, go.

10448
04:22:19,800 --> 04:22:20,960
Okay, this side is...

10449
04:22:21,940 --> 04:22:22,580
Okay, I'm here.

10450
04:22:23,800 --> 04:22:26,440
Shit, I'm not even... I'm playing from NA.

10451
04:22:27,580 --> 04:22:28,140
Crack on...

10452
04:22:28,820 --> 04:22:29,660
She's almost dead.

10453
04:22:29,900 --> 04:22:30,160
Yeah.

10454
04:22:30,320 --> 04:22:30,940
I will go kill her.

10455
04:22:30,940 --> 04:22:32,020
Down here, down here, down here.

10456
04:22:32,100 --> 04:22:32,600
Crypto's here.

10457
04:22:32,700 --> 04:22:33,140
Crypto's here.

10458
04:22:33,200 --> 04:22:34,080
Okay, I will go kill it.

10459
04:22:35,400 --> 04:22:36,040
Where is he?

10460
04:22:36,320 --> 04:22:36,700
Crack?

10461
04:22:37,400 --> 04:22:38,280
Oh, there, over there.

10462
04:22:39,080 --> 04:22:39,720
I see him.

10463
04:22:40,120 --> 04:22:40,440
Crack?

10464
04:22:40,760 --> 04:22:41,680
Can I one-kick though?

10465
04:22:41,720 --> 04:22:42,300
I got him, I got him, I got him.

10466
04:22:42,340 --> 04:22:43,000
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

10467
04:22:43,060 --> 04:22:43,160
Nice.

10468
04:22:43,500 --> 04:22:45,320
Yeah, that's fucking right.

10469
04:22:46,240 --> 04:22:47,220
That's fucking right.

10470
04:22:48,280 --> 04:22:49,640
Oh, I thought you...

10471
04:22:50,120 --> 04:22:51,880
I don't know who you are.

10472
04:22:55,920 --> 04:22:57,400
You're so toxic.

10473
04:23:00,940 --> 04:23:03,140
Yeah, this is our POI.

10474
04:23:03,260 --> 04:23:04,820
Leave our POI.

10475
04:23:07,380 --> 04:23:08,900
What did they do to you?

10476
04:23:10,040 --> 04:23:11,140
They shot me.

10477
04:23:14,240 --> 04:23:14,720
That's right.

10478
04:23:14,860 --> 04:23:16,060
I'm gonna do this to you too.

10479
04:23:16,800 --> 04:23:17,360
That's right.

10480
04:23:21,020 --> 04:23:22,060
There's a fragment.

10481
04:23:23,100 --> 04:23:24,220
We're so free here.

10482
04:23:24,500 --> 04:23:25,200
Yeah, we're so free.

10483
04:23:25,360 --> 04:23:25,920
We can loot.

10484
04:23:26,060 --> 04:23:27,760
We should go to No Name and loot a little bit.

10485
04:23:27,880 --> 04:23:28,920
Hold on, she's... yeah.

10486
04:23:29,800 --> 04:23:30,400
Yeah, we're broke.

10487
04:23:30,620 --> 04:23:31,100
She's crazy.

10488
04:23:32,000 --> 04:23:33,620
Why am I crazy?

10489
04:23:35,880 --> 04:23:37,240
What did I do?

10490
04:23:39,780 --> 04:23:41,220
They deserved it.

10491
04:23:43,620 --> 04:23:45,620
They tried to creep our game.

10492
04:23:46,620 --> 04:23:49,500
They tried to land where we were landing.

10493
04:23:50,000 --> 04:23:51,360
That's all I needed.

10494
04:23:51,560 --> 04:23:53,620
Oh yeah, and they had a crypto.

10495
04:23:53,660 --> 04:23:56,140
And they had a sniper to contest us.

10496
04:23:56,280 --> 04:23:57,320
Yeah, exactly.

10497
04:23:59,620 --> 04:24:00,600
That's on them.

10498
04:24:00,760 --> 04:24:01,480
They should have left.

10499
04:24:03,100 --> 04:24:04,400
They fought back.

10500
04:24:04,820 --> 04:24:05,700
So I have to kill them.

10501
04:24:05,920 --> 04:24:07,140
They got a laser.

10502
04:24:10,800 --> 04:24:12,340
Alright, I need shield cells.

10503
04:24:12,460 --> 04:24:13,000
Holy shit.

10504
04:24:13,020 --> 04:24:15,820
I will play... I will play...

10505
04:24:18,140 --> 04:24:18,580
...Farbine.

10506
04:24:19,020 --> 04:24:20,500
Okay, I'm gonna do triple take.

10507
04:24:20,540 --> 04:24:22,060
That was a good triple take game.

10508
04:24:24,440 --> 04:24:25,820
Ooh, there is...

10509
04:24:26,940 --> 04:24:28,000
Mmm, I should...

10510
04:24:28,740 --> 04:24:30,220
Okay, I'm gonna... I should go...

10511
04:24:30,220 --> 04:24:30,740
Oh, there's this.

10512
04:24:30,860 --> 04:24:31,360
You want?

10513
04:24:32,300 --> 04:24:33,160
Oh, never mind.

10514
04:24:33,380 --> 04:24:34,560
I'm staying on triple take then.

10515
04:24:34,820 --> 04:24:35,900
I need it.

10516
04:24:36,120 --> 04:24:37,040
Yeah, it's a sign.

10517
04:24:37,040 --> 04:24:38,120
I can open the vault.

10518
04:24:38,580 --> 04:24:39,340
Oh, nice.

10519
04:24:39,400 --> 04:24:41,320
They're resting at the back here, by the way.

10520
04:24:41,400 --> 04:24:41,680
Oh, okay.

10521
04:24:41,880 --> 04:24:42,860
Yeah, we can fight them after.

10522
04:24:43,140 --> 04:24:43,620
Yeah.

10523
04:24:44,400 --> 04:24:44,680
Yeah.

10524
04:24:44,740 --> 04:24:45,640
I'll go open the vault.

10525
04:24:45,760 --> 04:24:45,780
Alright.

10526
04:24:46,200 --> 04:24:47,140
We're heading over.

10527
04:24:47,520 --> 04:24:48,200
I'm so broke.

10528
04:24:48,460 --> 04:24:48,720
Oh, wait!

10529
04:24:48,960 --> 04:24:49,420
Wait!

10530
04:24:49,740 --> 04:24:49,920
What?

10531
04:24:50,940 --> 04:24:52,280
I... What is this?

10532
04:24:52,660 --> 04:24:53,400
It's a bug.

10533
04:24:53,640 --> 04:24:54,380
What happened?

10534
04:24:54,660 --> 04:24:55,900
Okay, I'm fine.

10535
04:24:56,120 --> 04:24:57,300
Oh, what happened?

10536
04:24:57,540 --> 04:24:59,060
It's a... like a... um...

10537
04:24:59,060 --> 04:24:59,740
I'm... um...

10538
04:24:59,740 --> 04:25:01,100
I'm... um...

10539
04:25:01,100 --> 04:25:02,000
No, no, wait.

10540
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:03,480
Okay, okay.

10541
04:25:03,720 --> 04:25:04,780
What the fuck?

10542
04:25:04,840 --> 04:25:05,340
I'm not going to go.

10543
04:25:05,580 --> 04:25:05,980
Okay.

10544
04:25:06,240 --> 04:25:06,720
I...

10545
04:25:06,720 --> 04:25:07,300
Wait.

10546
04:25:07,640 --> 04:25:08,580
I'm going to go.

10547
04:25:09,300 --> 04:25:09,780
Okay.

10548
04:25:10,800 --> 04:25:12,360
It's an inventory bug.

10549
04:25:12,680 --> 04:25:13,100
Like...

10550
04:25:13,100 --> 04:25:13,480
Oh.

10551
04:25:13,740 --> 04:25:15,320
Yeah, it's an inventory bug.

10552
04:25:16,980 --> 04:25:17,940
Let's see.

10553
04:25:18,100 --> 04:25:18,740
Oh, there's a triple charger.

10554
04:25:19,240 --> 04:25:19,620
Oh.

10555
04:25:20,380 --> 04:25:20,860
Mine.

10556
04:25:21,020 --> 04:25:21,460
Yoink.

10557
04:25:21,580 --> 04:25:22,560
I just took everything.

10558
04:25:24,740 --> 04:25:25,780
Wait, they have crypto?

10559
04:25:25,980 --> 04:25:26,680
They have crypto?

10560
04:25:28,220 --> 04:25:28,780
They do?

10561
04:25:29,040 --> 04:25:29,660
How do you know?

10562
04:25:29,780 --> 04:25:30,300
Yeah, they do.

10563
04:25:30,520 --> 04:25:31,000
They do.

10564
04:25:31,300 --> 04:25:31,880
You know.

10565
04:25:32,680 --> 04:25:34,080
I heard their drone.

10566
04:25:35,300 --> 04:25:35,720
Here.

10567
04:25:35,980 --> 04:25:36,820
There's a triple charger.

10568
04:25:37,060 --> 04:25:37,660
I don't need it.

10569
04:25:38,060 --> 04:25:39,220
Oh, there's a scope.

10570
04:25:39,420 --> 04:25:40,040
I need it.

10571
04:25:40,180 --> 04:25:40,500
I need it.

10572
04:25:40,600 --> 04:25:41,020
I need it.

10573
04:25:41,380 --> 04:25:42,180
I took it.

10574
04:25:42,260 --> 04:25:42,800
But I don't have...

10575
04:25:45,220 --> 04:25:46,460
My scope now.

10576
04:25:46,520 --> 04:25:47,160
I took it.

10577
04:25:47,200 --> 04:25:47,800
I took it.

10578
04:25:48,880 --> 04:25:49,440
All right.

10579
04:25:50,120 --> 04:25:50,540
Uh...

10580
04:25:51,960 --> 04:25:53,040
You have to be over there.

10581
04:25:53,040 --> 04:25:53,800
Yeah, right outside here.

10582
04:25:54,040 --> 04:25:54,420
Yeah.

10583
04:25:54,460 --> 04:25:54,620
Okay.

10584
04:25:55,360 --> 04:25:56,300
Do you have...

10585
04:25:56,300 --> 04:25:56,920
Do you have...

10586
04:25:56,920 --> 04:25:57,740
Do you have any...

10587
04:25:58,640 --> 04:25:59,740
Do you have any...

10588
04:25:59,740 --> 04:25:59,800
Do you have any...

10589
04:25:59,800 --> 04:26:00,240
Do you have any...

10590
04:26:00,780 --> 04:26:01,140
Oh, yeah.

10591
04:26:01,140 --> 04:26:01,240
They're here.

10592
04:26:01,240 --> 04:26:01,320
Oh, yeah.

10593
04:26:01,320 --> 04:26:01,760
They're here.

10594
04:26:02,980 --> 04:26:03,340
Loba.

10595
04:26:03,660 --> 04:26:03,800
Okay.

10596
04:26:04,240 --> 04:26:04,740
All right.

10597
04:26:04,800 --> 04:26:06,160
Thank you.

10598
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:07,420
They have Loba.

10599
04:26:08,060 --> 04:26:08,620
I'm looking.

10600
04:26:08,780 --> 04:26:09,440
They opened the door.

10601
04:26:09,580 --> 04:26:09,660
Yeah, Loba.

10602
04:26:09,660 --> 04:26:09,820
They're...

10603
04:26:10,340 --> 04:26:11,040
Loba crypto.

10604
04:26:11,320 --> 04:26:12,160
No, they're far.

10605
04:26:12,280 --> 04:26:12,640
They're far.

10606
04:26:12,640 --> 04:26:12,980
They're far.

10607
04:26:13,040 --> 04:26:13,440
Oh, okay.

10608
04:26:13,440 --> 04:26:13,820
Crypto again?

10609
04:26:14,420 --> 04:26:14,780
Yeah.

10610
04:26:14,860 --> 04:26:15,520
Okay, can...

10611
04:26:15,520 --> 04:26:15,800
Okay.

10612
04:26:15,900 --> 04:26:16,600
I will go.

10613
04:26:16,740 --> 04:26:17,420
I will go.

10614
04:26:19,040 --> 04:26:20,040
I'm waiting for you, Ditto.

10615
04:26:20,500 --> 04:26:21,200
They're far though.

10616
04:26:21,200 --> 04:26:21,480
They're far.

10617
04:26:22,100 --> 04:26:22,460
Yeah.

10618
04:26:22,960 --> 04:26:23,600
Come here.

10619
04:26:23,920 --> 04:26:24,040
Come here.

10620
04:26:24,200 --> 04:26:25,720
I will zip line.

10621
04:26:25,960 --> 04:26:26,460
You see?

10622
04:26:27,060 --> 04:26:28,040
Oh, they're so far.

10623
04:26:28,240 --> 04:26:29,040
They're like right here.

10624
04:26:29,340 --> 04:26:29,680
Where?

10625
04:26:30,360 --> 04:26:31,020
I was...

10626
04:26:31,760 --> 04:26:32,440
Holy shit.

10627
04:26:32,520 --> 04:26:32,980
Do you see this?

10628
04:26:34,400 --> 04:26:35,840
One, two, three, four.

10629
04:26:36,200 --> 04:26:36,820
Do you see that?

10630
04:26:37,080 --> 04:26:37,220
What?

10631
04:26:37,660 --> 04:26:38,060
No.

10632
04:26:38,160 --> 04:26:39,260
I was scan doing that.

10633
04:26:39,560 --> 04:26:40,920
What the fuck are they doing?

10634
04:26:40,980 --> 04:26:41,640
Look at the map.

10635
04:26:42,480 --> 04:26:43,040
Right here.

10636
04:26:43,040 --> 04:26:43,520
What the heck?

10637
04:26:43,600 --> 04:26:44,160
Oh, yeah.

10638
04:26:44,340 --> 04:26:44,960
Oh, my God.

10639
04:26:45,280 --> 04:26:46,000
A lot.

10640
04:26:46,220 --> 04:26:46,720
A lot.

10641
04:26:46,740 --> 04:26:47,500
Yeah, and then there's here.

10642
04:26:49,060 --> 04:26:50,140
One team with us.

10643
04:26:50,540 --> 04:26:51,240
Oh, I got scan.

10644
04:26:51,300 --> 04:26:51,560
I got scan.

10645
04:26:51,700 --> 04:26:51,860
Okay.

10646
04:26:52,460 --> 04:26:52,960
What's going on?

10647
04:26:52,960 --> 04:26:53,640
It's Fable.

10648
04:26:54,360 --> 04:26:55,200
Wait, they went there.

10649
04:26:55,200 --> 04:26:55,420
Oh, there.

10650
04:26:55,680 --> 04:26:55,820
Oh, there.

10651
04:26:55,820 --> 04:26:56,020
Oh, there.

10652
04:26:56,540 --> 04:26:57,240
There's one.

10653
04:26:57,280 --> 04:26:58,440
There's one that flew too far.

10654
04:26:58,640 --> 04:26:58,680
Oh, they're flying.

10655
04:26:58,800 --> 04:26:59,140
They're flying.

10656
04:26:59,340 --> 04:26:59,600
Yeah.

10657
04:26:59,860 --> 04:27:00,760
They're getting high ground.

10658
04:27:00,920 --> 04:27:01,560
They're flying.

10659
04:27:02,520 --> 04:27:02,920
Okay.

10660
04:27:03,140 --> 04:27:04,540
I will try to get the anger.

10661
04:27:05,680 --> 04:27:06,600
I think they're running.

10662
04:27:07,620 --> 04:27:08,340
Yeah, they are.

10663
04:27:08,820 --> 04:27:11,600
Yeah, I think they went to the ring.

10664
04:27:12,500 --> 04:27:13,160
Yeah, they are.

10665
04:27:13,220 --> 04:27:13,660
They're gone.

10666
04:27:13,720 --> 04:27:13,920
Gone.

10667
04:27:13,940 --> 04:27:14,280
They're gone.

10668
04:27:14,280 --> 04:27:14,560
Gone.

10669
04:27:14,580 --> 04:27:16,320
I think we should go level 7.

10670
04:27:16,820 --> 04:27:17,220
Yeah.

10671
04:27:17,240 --> 04:27:17,420
Yeah.

10672
04:27:17,500 --> 04:27:18,020
Take this.

10673
04:27:18,060 --> 04:27:19,460
This has armor for you, Hiro.

10674
04:27:19,740 --> 04:27:20,140
Okay.

10675
04:27:21,440 --> 04:27:23,340
I will carve battery first.

10676
04:27:24,200 --> 04:27:24,660
Yeah.

10677
04:27:25,380 --> 04:27:26,260
Evil cash.

10678
04:27:27,000 --> 04:27:27,460
Okay.

10679
04:27:27,840 --> 04:27:29,600
I'm just getting a shield cell.

10680
04:27:29,820 --> 04:27:29,940
Okay.

10681
04:27:29,940 --> 04:27:30,760
I will carve battery first.

10682
04:27:30,760 --> 04:27:30,780
All right.

10683
04:27:30,880 --> 04:27:32,880
Let's get the lava siphon.

10684
04:27:34,040 --> 04:27:34,700
We should.

10685
04:27:34,880 --> 04:27:36,880
Yeah, we should get the lava siphon now.

10686
04:27:37,800 --> 04:27:38,260
Yes.

10687
04:27:39,480 --> 04:27:40,420
Let me see.

10688
04:27:40,520 --> 04:27:42,800
We should go here.

10689
04:27:43,400 --> 04:27:43,860
Hmm.

10690
04:27:44,340 --> 04:27:44,920
All right.

10691
04:27:44,920 --> 04:27:45,140
I'll wait.

10692
04:27:45,180 --> 04:27:47,540
Third floor is the base, I think.

10693
04:27:47,820 --> 04:27:48,500
I'll wait.

10694
04:27:49,120 --> 04:27:49,580
Wait.

10695
04:27:49,620 --> 04:27:49,840
Wait.

10696
04:27:49,860 --> 04:27:50,120
My phone is ringing.

10697
04:27:50,140 --> 04:27:50,540
I'm going to get my zip line.

10698
04:27:50,780 --> 04:27:51,260
All right.

10699
04:27:51,820 --> 04:27:52,420
We're here.

10700
04:27:53,500 --> 04:27:53,900
Okay.

10701
04:27:54,440 --> 04:27:55,060
Here, here.

10702
04:27:55,660 --> 04:27:56,200
Oh, no.

10703
04:27:56,260 --> 04:27:56,900
We can't.

10704
04:27:57,060 --> 04:27:57,460
Wait.

10705
04:27:58,760 --> 04:27:59,560
Tera, what happened?

10706
04:27:59,580 --> 04:27:59,760
Come here.

10707
04:28:00,080 --> 04:28:01,000
You're RGN.

10708
04:28:01,120 --> 04:28:01,660
Come here.

10709
04:28:01,680 --> 04:28:01,940
Come here.

10710
04:28:02,820 --> 04:28:03,220
Okay.

10711
04:28:03,420 --> 04:28:03,840
Oh, okay.

10712
04:28:05,200 --> 04:28:05,600
Yay.

10713
04:28:08,640 --> 04:28:10,080
There might be people here.

10714
04:28:10,080 --> 04:28:11,680
This zip line is lagging.

10715
04:28:12,780 --> 04:28:13,340
Oh, wait.

10716
04:28:13,500 --> 04:28:14,420
The zip line is fine for me.

10717
04:28:14,620 --> 04:28:15,280
At least you.

10718
04:28:15,500 --> 04:28:15,840
Really?

10719
04:28:16,060 --> 04:28:16,440
Yeah, yeah.

10720
04:28:16,640 --> 04:28:17,380
Oh, bye.

10721
04:28:17,440 --> 04:28:17,600
Bye.

10722
04:28:17,740 --> 04:28:17,860
Bye.

10723
04:28:18,240 --> 04:28:18,640
Okay.

10724
04:28:19,540 --> 04:28:19,940
100.

10725
04:28:20,120 --> 04:28:20,600
Okay.

10726
04:28:20,600 --> 04:28:22,040
We go check that building.

10727
04:28:22,720 --> 04:28:23,120
Okay.

10728
04:28:23,180 --> 04:28:23,520
Okay.

10729
04:28:23,520 --> 04:28:24,480
There's no one, I think.

10730
04:28:24,580 --> 04:28:24,780
Okay.

10731
04:28:24,880 --> 04:28:25,280
Okay.

10732
04:28:25,380 --> 04:28:26,000
I'll go check it.

10733
04:28:26,000 --> 04:28:26,100
Okay.

10734
04:28:26,160 --> 04:28:27,260
I'm going to poke a little bit.

10735
04:28:28,340 --> 04:28:28,940
And then...

10736
04:28:28,940 --> 04:28:29,480
They're not looking.

10737
04:28:29,520 --> 04:28:30,060
They're scared.

10738
04:28:30,960 --> 04:28:31,360
Wait.

10739
04:28:31,440 --> 04:28:32,240
I still have no shields.

10740
04:28:32,280 --> 04:28:32,500
Oh, shit.

10741
04:28:32,500 --> 04:28:33,200
Oh, then let's get this.

10742
04:28:33,880 --> 04:28:34,580
Oh, my God.

10743
04:28:34,660 --> 04:28:35,520
Oh, my...

10744
04:28:35,520 --> 04:28:35,940
You...

10745
04:28:36,720 --> 04:28:37,120
Okay.

10746
04:28:37,240 --> 04:28:39,240
You're going to get it.

10747
04:28:39,720 --> 04:28:40,120
Okay.

10748
04:28:40,300 --> 04:28:42,900
Third floor is the base, I think.

10749
04:28:43,120 --> 04:28:43,380
Okay.

10750
04:28:43,440 --> 04:28:44,240
I need a shield cell.

10751
04:28:44,380 --> 04:28:45,800
I just realized I have zero shield cells.

10752
04:28:46,560 --> 04:28:47,600
I can give you some.

10753
04:28:48,040 --> 04:28:48,440
Why?

10754
04:28:48,440 --> 04:28:49,440
Why is it all...

10755
04:28:49,440 --> 04:28:50,780
Because I forgot to loot.

10756
04:28:50,920 --> 04:28:50,960
Yeah.

10757
04:28:51,700 --> 04:28:52,640
Oh, my God.

10758
04:28:52,840 --> 04:28:53,000
Yeah.

10759
04:28:53,060 --> 04:28:53,520
I don't need bats.

10760
04:28:53,600 --> 04:28:54,400
I have a lot of bats.

10761
04:28:54,440 --> 04:28:55,060
You can take the bat.

10762
04:28:55,120 --> 04:28:55,380
Really?

10763
04:28:55,680 --> 04:28:56,460
You just need a shell?

10764
04:28:56,580 --> 04:28:57,780
I have seven bats.

10765
04:28:57,800 --> 04:28:58,280
Oh, yeah.

10766
04:28:58,540 --> 04:28:59,020
Oh, yeah.

10767
04:28:59,060 --> 04:28:59,080
Oh, yeah.

10768
04:28:59,080 --> 04:28:59,260
Oh, yeah.

10769
04:28:59,380 --> 04:28:59,540
Oh, yeah.

10770
04:28:59,540 --> 04:28:59,620
Okay.

10771
04:28:59,900 --> 04:29:00,760
One team there.

10772
04:29:01,760 --> 04:29:02,720
Sell the bottom ducky.

10773
04:29:03,140 --> 04:29:03,500
Okay.

10774
04:29:04,980 --> 04:29:05,560
Grab it.

10775
04:29:06,240 --> 04:29:07,120
He's one tech.

10776
04:29:07,420 --> 04:29:07,780
He's...

10777
04:29:07,780 --> 04:29:09,140
There's people behind us.

10778
04:29:09,160 --> 04:29:09,500
He's tech.

10779
04:29:09,500 --> 04:29:10,360
What the hey?

10780
04:29:11,840 --> 04:29:12,980
Why you shoot me?

10781
04:29:14,220 --> 04:29:15,860
There's a team in that small house.

10782
04:29:15,920 --> 04:29:16,720
There's a team in small house.

10783
04:29:16,720 --> 04:29:17,360
Okay.

10784
04:29:17,760 --> 04:29:18,060
Okay.

10785
04:29:18,200 --> 04:29:18,820
Let me...

10786
04:29:18,820 --> 04:29:20,060
We have three.

10787
04:29:20,220 --> 04:29:21,580
We have our mate.

10788
04:29:22,340 --> 04:29:22,740
No.

10789
04:29:22,940 --> 04:29:23,440
Not yet.

10790
04:29:23,640 --> 04:29:24,040
70%.

10791
04:29:24,040 --> 04:29:24,280
Wait.

10792
04:29:24,340 --> 04:29:24,960
They're coming over.

10793
04:29:25,040 --> 04:29:25,480
They're coming over.

10794
04:29:26,080 --> 04:29:26,480
What?

10795
04:29:27,580 --> 04:29:28,400
The password is cracked.

10796
04:29:29,120 --> 04:29:29,440
All cracked.

10797
04:29:30,200 --> 04:29:31,860
Yeah, but we can't do anything about it.

10798
04:29:32,100 --> 04:29:33,000
They're all above us.

10799
04:29:33,000 --> 04:29:33,160
One guy there.

10800
04:29:33,620 --> 04:29:34,220
Two guys.

10801
04:29:34,220 --> 04:29:35,040
Two guys above us.

10802
04:29:35,760 --> 04:29:36,560
I'm gonna...

10803
04:29:36,560 --> 04:29:36,660
Okay.

10804
04:29:36,680 --> 04:29:37,200
I will nade.

10805
04:29:37,220 --> 04:29:37,620
I will nade.

10806
04:29:37,620 --> 04:29:38,020
I will nade.

10807
04:29:38,020 --> 04:29:38,300
I will nade.

10808
04:29:38,300 --> 04:29:38,520
I will nade.

10809
04:29:38,520 --> 04:29:38,900
I nade it too.

10810
04:29:40,400 --> 04:29:40,800
No.

10811
04:29:40,800 --> 04:29:42,180
I hit the railing.

10812
04:29:43,700 --> 04:29:44,740
They're below us?

10813
04:29:44,920 --> 04:29:45,440
Yeah.

10814
04:29:45,460 --> 04:29:46,580
We gotta make sure nobody...

10815
04:29:46,580 --> 04:29:48,440
I'm gonna make sure nobody's below us.

10816
04:29:49,160 --> 04:29:50,340
I'm on the other door.

10817
04:29:51,360 --> 04:29:52,980
There's people here too.

10818
04:29:55,400 --> 04:29:55,920
Here.

10819
04:29:59,770 --> 04:30:00,750
Oh my god.

10820
04:30:00,990 --> 04:30:01,230
Yeah.

10821
04:30:01,250 --> 04:30:02,150
I'm looking below us too.

10822
04:30:02,650 --> 04:30:03,170
Okay.

10823
04:30:03,370 --> 04:30:04,110
Because they wanna...

10824
04:30:04,110 --> 04:30:04,870
They wanna...

10825
04:30:04,870 --> 04:30:06,510
I want people to flank us here.

10826
04:30:06,950 --> 04:30:07,570
No, I don't.

10827
04:30:07,690 --> 04:30:08,110
I haven't.

10828
04:30:08,490 --> 04:30:09,370
I think...

10829
04:30:09,950 --> 04:30:10,470
He'll...

10830
04:30:10,470 --> 04:30:10,950
He'll...

10831
04:30:10,950 --> 04:30:11,330
Pay here.

10832
04:30:11,390 --> 04:30:11,730
Pay here.

10833
04:30:12,010 --> 04:30:12,530
Pay here.

10834
04:30:12,550 --> 04:30:12,950
He has the...

10835
04:30:13,510 --> 04:30:14,210
Did you...

10836
04:30:14,210 --> 04:30:14,530
Yeah.

10837
04:30:15,070 --> 04:30:15,470
Wait.

10838
04:30:15,990 --> 04:30:16,550
I have...

10839
04:30:16,550 --> 04:30:16,690
I have...

10840
04:30:16,690 --> 04:30:17,050
He has the stair.

10841
04:30:17,430 --> 04:30:17,830
Wow.

10842
04:30:17,930 --> 04:30:18,170
Wait.

10843
04:30:18,310 --> 04:30:18,490
No.

10844
04:30:18,650 --> 04:30:19,550
Two hundred.

10845
04:30:19,710 --> 04:30:19,910
Okay.

10846
04:30:19,950 --> 04:30:20,090
Okay.

10847
04:30:22,690 --> 04:30:23,590
They went back.

10848
04:30:23,670 --> 04:30:23,930
They went up.

10849
04:30:23,950 --> 04:30:25,290
I can get him.

10850
04:30:25,390 --> 04:30:25,590
I can't get him.

10851
04:30:25,710 --> 04:30:26,390
I'm gonna...

10852
04:30:26,390 --> 04:30:27,270
He's scared.

10853
04:30:27,270 --> 04:30:27,750
I'm closing the door.

10854
04:30:27,750 --> 04:30:28,230
He's going this way.

10855
04:30:28,230 --> 04:30:28,410
He's going this way.

10856
04:30:29,190 --> 04:30:29,590
Okay.

10857
04:30:29,730 --> 04:30:30,390
I did it.

10858
04:30:30,410 --> 04:30:30,690
Close.

10859
04:30:31,030 --> 04:30:31,670
He went back.

10860
04:30:32,050 --> 04:30:32,870
I'm gonna close the door for us.

10861
04:30:32,870 --> 04:30:33,330
They went back.

10862
04:30:33,350 --> 04:30:34,210
They're scared.

10863
04:30:34,210 --> 04:30:35,170
They're scared, they went back.

10864
04:30:35,250 --> 04:30:36,550
Yeah, they can't go through the store now.

10865
04:30:36,830 --> 04:30:37,870
They're all...

10866
04:30:37,870 --> 04:30:38,470
Careful.

10867
04:30:38,690 --> 04:30:38,810
Okay.

10868
04:30:39,490 --> 04:30:40,930
Wait, there's so many people.

10869
04:30:41,110 --> 04:30:41,370
Okay.

10870
04:30:41,530 --> 04:30:42,330
Another squad!

10871
04:30:42,530 --> 04:30:42,790
I guess we can.

10872
04:30:42,930 --> 04:30:43,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10873
04:30:44,530 --> 04:30:45,110
Okay, come.

10874
04:30:45,990 --> 04:30:47,850
I'm not gonna use... I'm not gonna peek anymore.

10875
04:30:48,010 --> 04:30:49,050
I don't have many cells.

10876
04:30:49,070 --> 04:30:49,610
There's a...

10877
04:30:51,430 --> 04:30:51,830
Here.

10878
04:30:53,230 --> 04:30:54,230
I'll just take everything.

10879
04:30:55,210 --> 04:30:56,790
Okay, I'm gonna make sure...

10880
04:30:56,790 --> 04:30:57,210
Okay.

10881
04:30:58,530 --> 04:30:59,910
Oh my god, they're crazy.

10882
04:31:01,070 --> 04:31:02,790
Wait, they're coming on top of us?

10883
04:31:02,890 --> 04:31:03,130
Really?

10884
04:31:04,630 --> 04:31:05,690
Yeah, that's fine.

10885
04:31:06,770 --> 04:31:07,990
The guy right...

10886
04:31:07,990 --> 04:31:08,950
They're above us.

10887
04:31:09,050 --> 04:31:09,250
Here.

10888
04:31:09,930 --> 04:31:10,450
Okay.

10889
04:31:10,550 --> 04:31:11,170
That's fine.

10890
04:31:13,090 --> 04:31:14,770
I'm gonna scan them, okay?

10891
04:31:15,250 --> 04:31:15,670
Okay.

10892
04:31:16,530 --> 04:31:18,450
We play this loom, okay?

10893
04:31:18,770 --> 04:31:19,270
Okay.

10894
04:31:19,530 --> 04:31:19,870
Okay.

10895
04:31:20,230 --> 04:31:20,750
Okay.

10896
04:31:21,990 --> 04:31:22,910
I'm trying to...

10897
04:31:22,910 --> 04:31:23,730
Let's see, one, two...

10898
04:31:23,730 --> 04:31:24,790
How many people are above us?

10899
04:31:24,930 --> 04:31:25,350
Two.

10900
04:31:25,670 --> 04:31:26,190
Okay.

10901
04:31:26,930 --> 04:31:27,450
Two?

10902
04:31:27,590 --> 04:31:27,750
Yeah.

10903
04:31:27,850 --> 04:31:28,290
Only two.

10904
04:31:29,850 --> 04:31:30,970
Let me check the rest.

10905
04:31:31,130 --> 04:31:32,810
This kind of building is more cell.

10906
04:31:32,810 --> 04:31:32,990
Yeah.

10907
04:31:33,630 --> 04:31:35,790
This one, this one, there's one person down here.

10908
04:31:36,910 --> 04:31:37,310
Yeah.

10909
04:31:37,550 --> 04:31:39,450
I'm looking around behind us here.

10910
04:31:39,530 --> 04:31:40,050
I'm looking here.

10911
04:31:40,870 --> 04:31:41,790
There's a team here.

10912
04:31:42,450 --> 04:31:44,710
How many, how many battery do you guys have?

10913
04:31:44,890 --> 04:31:45,550
I have seven.

10914
04:31:45,570 --> 04:31:45,990
I have seven.

10915
04:31:46,150 --> 04:31:46,990
I have eight actually.

10916
04:31:47,050 --> 04:31:47,830
We have so many.

10917
04:31:47,990 --> 04:31:49,690
Can I have, can I have, can I have some?

10918
04:31:50,170 --> 04:31:50,910
Here, here's two.

10919
04:31:52,950 --> 04:31:53,790
There's one team here.

10920
04:31:53,890 --> 04:31:54,750
There's another top press.

10921
04:31:54,850 --> 04:31:55,110
Okay.

10922
04:31:57,210 --> 04:31:59,030
Someone look below us, just in case.

10923
04:31:59,450 --> 04:31:59,850
Okay.

10924
04:32:00,630 --> 04:32:01,830
I'll take a bath later.

10925
04:32:01,830 --> 04:32:02,350
Okay.

10926
04:32:02,730 --> 04:32:04,150
I'll just go look around now.

10927
04:32:07,430 --> 04:32:08,010
I'm checking.

10928
04:32:08,850 --> 04:32:09,530
They're fighting.

10929
04:32:09,710 --> 04:32:09,950
They're...

10930
04:32:10,690 --> 04:32:11,730
There's so many people.

10931
04:32:11,830 --> 04:32:13,230
Oh my god, so many people died.

10932
04:32:13,670 --> 04:32:14,370
Yeah, we're still here.

10933
04:32:14,510 --> 04:32:14,930
We're still here.

10934
04:32:15,010 --> 04:32:15,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10935
04:32:15,570 --> 04:32:16,630
Inside the zone.

10936
04:32:16,950 --> 04:32:18,530
So many people died though.

10937
04:32:18,570 --> 04:32:19,130
Holy shit.

10938
04:32:21,090 --> 04:32:21,810
This is zone.

10939
04:32:21,870 --> 04:32:22,690
This is zone right here.

10940
04:32:23,870 --> 04:32:24,430
Oh yeah.

10941
04:32:24,990 --> 04:32:26,010
Wait, wait, hello?

10942
04:32:26,370 --> 04:32:27,430
Am I, am I still here?

10943
04:32:27,530 --> 04:32:27,750
Yeah.

10944
04:32:27,770 --> 04:32:28,110
Oh my god.

10945
04:32:28,130 --> 04:32:28,750
My internet.

10946
04:32:29,010 --> 04:32:29,550
Oh no.

10947
04:32:29,990 --> 04:32:31,110
You're still in, you're still in.

10948
04:32:31,250 --> 04:32:31,970
I'm here, I'm here.

10949
04:32:32,090 --> 04:32:32,530
I'm here.

10950
04:32:32,630 --> 04:32:33,090
I'm here.

10951
04:32:33,110 --> 04:32:33,370
I'm here.

10952
04:32:33,390 --> 04:32:34,550
You're just flying around.

10953
04:32:34,710 --> 04:32:35,050
You're flying.

10954
04:32:35,250 --> 04:32:37,390
Yeah, I see a drone flying around.

10955
04:32:37,550 --> 04:32:38,050
You're still here.

10956
04:32:40,570 --> 04:32:41,470
Let me check.

10957
04:32:43,750 --> 04:32:45,110
You're still in here.

10958
04:32:46,530 --> 04:32:47,530
You're inside here.

10959
04:32:47,770 --> 04:32:49,790
How many light ammo do you have?

10960
04:32:50,710 --> 04:32:51,390
I have...

10961
04:32:51,390 --> 04:32:51,770
Light?

10962
04:32:52,170 --> 04:32:52,330
Uh...

10963
04:32:52,330 --> 04:32:52,890
Light.

10964
04:32:53,110 --> 04:32:53,950
I can give a bit.

10965
04:32:54,030 --> 04:32:54,330
Oh.

10966
04:32:54,510 --> 04:32:55,090
Thank you.

10967
04:32:55,210 --> 04:32:55,530
Okay.

10968
04:32:55,630 --> 04:32:56,130
I'll give you 20.

10969
04:32:56,190 --> 04:32:56,710
That's it.

10970
04:32:56,890 --> 04:32:58,650
I, I can, I can give you, I can give you some.

10971
04:32:58,730 --> 04:32:59,130
I can give.

10972
04:32:59,250 --> 04:32:59,930
Here, here, here.

10973
04:32:59,930 --> 04:33:00,050
Ditto.

10974
04:33:00,490 --> 04:33:00,850
Here.

10975
04:33:01,210 --> 04:33:02,490
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10976
04:33:03,390 --> 04:33:04,730
Holy shit, there's a team here too.

10977
04:33:05,090 --> 04:33:05,550
Thank you.

10978
04:33:06,710 --> 04:33:07,550
I get EMP.

10979
04:33:07,870 --> 04:33:09,070
Just tell me who do EMP.

10980
04:33:09,650 --> 04:33:11,690
I feel like we have to EMP the people above us.

10981
04:33:12,170 --> 04:33:13,310
Because they're the most annoying.

10982
04:33:13,510 --> 04:33:13,530
Me too.

10983
04:33:15,310 --> 04:33:16,910
We could do, do you want to go all the way down?

10984
04:33:17,050 --> 04:33:20,050
Do you want to go down to rotate or above?

10985
04:33:20,410 --> 04:33:22,130
Okay, let me check, let me check, let me check above her.

10986
04:33:23,950 --> 04:33:25,110
It's, it's one guy.

10987
04:33:25,490 --> 04:33:26,210
It's one guy?

10988
04:33:26,250 --> 04:33:26,790
It's one guy.

10989
04:33:27,510 --> 04:33:27,830
Okay.

10990
04:33:27,830 --> 04:33:28,310
It's one guy.

10991
04:33:28,390 --> 04:33:29,370
Do you want, do you want to fight him?

10992
04:33:29,490 --> 04:33:30,250
Do you want to just kill him?

10993
04:33:30,370 --> 04:33:30,670
I can.

10994
04:33:30,730 --> 04:33:31,090
He's not moving.

10995
04:33:31,250 --> 04:33:31,490
Yeah, yeah.

10996
04:33:31,770 --> 04:33:32,630
What, I can do it now.

10997
04:33:32,810 --> 04:33:33,130
Is he?

10998
04:33:33,390 --> 04:33:33,930
I'm alright.

10999
04:33:34,110 --> 04:33:34,830
Just kill him.

11000
04:33:37,610 --> 04:33:39,110
He just moved.

11001
04:33:39,250 --> 04:33:40,630
Are you fucking kidding me?

11002
04:33:41,710 --> 04:33:42,190
Here.

11003
04:33:42,270 --> 04:33:43,410
Are they coming to us?

11004
04:33:43,430 --> 04:33:46,970
He literally just moved the moment you said it's one guy.

11005
04:33:46,970 --> 04:33:47,730
Wait, did it get banned?

11006
04:33:48,630 --> 04:33:50,450
Like, like his team is gone.

11007
04:33:50,630 --> 04:33:51,270
Did it get banned?

11008
04:33:51,290 --> 04:33:51,790
I don't know.

11009
04:33:51,810 --> 04:33:52,930
What happened to them?

11010
04:33:53,230 --> 04:33:54,070
That's crazy.

11011
04:33:54,170 --> 04:33:55,490
I think they got banned.

11012
04:33:56,150 --> 04:33:57,570
That's so funny.

11013
04:33:57,770 --> 04:33:58,370
What happened?

11014
04:33:58,570 --> 04:33:59,070
What happened?

11015
04:33:59,190 --> 04:33:59,490
What happened?

11016
04:33:59,490 --> 04:34:00,590
We have no, he just disappeared.

11017
04:34:00,690 --> 04:34:02,330
I'm getting ready to EMP this.

11018
04:34:02,410 --> 04:34:03,370
I'm getting ready to EMP this.

11019
04:34:03,370 --> 04:34:03,450
Okay.

11020
04:34:03,770 --> 04:34:04,130
Where?

11021
04:34:04,450 --> 04:34:04,710
Where?

11022
04:34:04,810 --> 04:34:04,990
Where?

11023
04:34:05,230 --> 04:34:05,570
Here.

11024
04:34:06,430 --> 04:34:06,790
89.

11025
04:34:07,350 --> 04:34:08,150
All, all broken?

11026
04:34:08,830 --> 04:34:10,010
I can't do anything about it.

11027
04:34:10,470 --> 04:34:10,830
Okay.

11028
04:34:11,010 --> 04:34:12,370
I, I have no anger.

11029
04:34:12,510 --> 04:34:13,310
I have no anger.

11030
04:34:13,670 --> 04:34:14,070
Yeah, yeah.

11031
04:34:14,150 --> 04:34:15,910
I will go outside the, outside the building.

11032
04:34:15,910 --> 04:34:16,630
I'm going, I'm going here.

11033
04:34:16,770 --> 04:34:17,170
I'm going here.

11034
04:34:17,590 --> 04:34:17,950
Okay.

11035
04:34:18,210 --> 04:34:19,430
I'm gonna grab some nades too.

11036
04:34:19,430 --> 04:34:20,570
But there, there, there's a guy there.

11037
04:34:20,670 --> 04:34:20,790
Okay?

11038
04:34:20,870 --> 04:34:21,410
There's a guy there.

11039
04:34:21,550 --> 04:34:21,710
Ditto.

11040
04:34:24,450 --> 04:34:25,010
I'll go to Ditto.

11041
04:34:25,010 --> 04:34:25,930
Watch out for that guy.

11042
04:34:26,630 --> 04:34:26,990
Wait.

11043
04:34:27,250 --> 04:34:28,130
Oh my god.

11044
04:34:28,150 --> 04:34:28,990
He ran so fast.

11045
04:34:29,190 --> 04:34:30,870
If you guys find a sniper ammo, let me know.

11046
04:34:30,990 --> 04:34:32,050
This team, this team, this team.

11047
04:34:32,110 --> 04:34:32,270
Okay.

11048
04:34:33,370 --> 04:34:34,370
I really need sniper ammo.

11049
04:34:34,690 --> 04:34:36,010
I got scanned from my left.

11050
04:34:36,690 --> 04:34:37,170
That's them.

11051
04:34:38,410 --> 04:34:39,730
Almost get a lifeline.

11052
04:34:40,090 --> 04:34:41,130
I don't have an angle.

11053
04:34:42,070 --> 04:34:42,670
I'm trying to get across.

11054
04:34:42,670 --> 04:34:43,570
I'm charging my ult.

11055
04:34:44,530 --> 04:34:44,970
Okay.

11056
04:34:45,370 --> 04:34:46,350
There's a team here.

11057
04:34:46,590 --> 04:34:47,370
There's a team there.

11058
04:34:47,410 --> 04:34:48,310
Really behind this.

11059
04:34:51,670 --> 04:34:52,670
Team here too.

11060
04:34:52,930 --> 04:34:53,470
Team here.

11061
04:34:54,750 --> 04:34:55,570
That one's cracked.

11062
04:34:55,790 --> 04:34:56,010
Ditto.

11063
04:34:57,810 --> 04:34:58,250
Okay.

11064
04:34:58,250 --> 04:34:59,230
Oh, I have no anger.

11065
04:34:59,470 --> 04:34:59,630
Oh.

11066
04:35:00,030 --> 04:35:01,070
I'm trying, I'm trying.

11067
04:35:01,550 --> 04:35:02,410
I'm getting bats.

11068
04:35:02,430 --> 04:35:02,830
I'm getting bats.

11069
04:35:03,370 --> 04:35:03,930
You guys need bats here.

11070
04:35:03,930 --> 04:35:04,670
Here, I have so many bats.

11071
04:35:04,710 --> 04:35:05,570
They're resing there.

11072
04:35:05,670 --> 04:35:06,090
They're resing.

11073
04:35:06,190 --> 04:35:07,650
Can we go?

11074
04:35:09,070 --> 04:35:09,350
Okay.

11075
04:35:09,750 --> 04:35:11,270
Wait, they scanned us again, Ditto.

11076
04:35:11,430 --> 04:35:11,930
Here, here, here, here.

11077
04:35:12,190 --> 04:35:12,470
Wait.

11078
04:35:12,590 --> 04:35:13,210
I'm going to Ditto.

11079
04:35:13,250 --> 04:35:13,690
I'm going to Ditto.

11080
04:35:13,690 --> 04:35:14,390
We are going to Ditto.

11081
04:35:14,410 --> 04:35:14,770
Go to Ditto.

11082
04:35:16,170 --> 04:35:16,770
Oh my god.

11083
04:35:16,890 --> 04:35:18,070
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

11084
04:35:18,270 --> 04:35:18,830
Oh my god.

11085
04:35:18,950 --> 04:35:19,450
Oh, Ditto.

11086
04:35:19,630 --> 04:35:20,670
We're trying to get to you.

11087
04:35:21,650 --> 04:35:22,490
Oh, I'm getting shot.

11088
04:35:23,550 --> 04:35:23,830
Yeah.

11089
04:35:24,110 --> 04:35:24,390
Okay.

11090
04:35:24,450 --> 04:35:25,270
We can't do this.

11091
04:35:25,750 --> 04:35:26,330
I'm going inside.

11092
04:35:26,430 --> 04:35:27,130
I'm going inside the bin.

11093
04:35:27,510 --> 04:35:28,070
Oh no.

11094
04:35:28,130 --> 04:35:28,370
I'm dead.

11095
04:35:28,730 --> 04:35:29,010
Just...

11096
04:35:30,790 --> 04:35:31,070
Okay.

11097
04:35:31,150 --> 04:35:31,490
I don't want.

11098
04:35:31,490 --> 04:35:31,750
I don't want.

11099
04:35:31,750 --> 04:35:31,930
I don't want.

11100
04:35:31,950 --> 04:35:32,410
I don't want.

11101
04:35:33,930 --> 04:35:35,370
I'm in the barrel.

11102
04:35:35,490 --> 04:35:36,050
I'm in the barrel.

11103
04:35:36,230 --> 04:35:36,250
I'm in the barrel.

11104
04:35:39,350 --> 04:35:39,850
Oh my god.

11105
04:35:40,030 --> 04:35:40,590
I'm in the barrel.

11106
04:35:40,590 --> 04:35:40,810
I'm coming to you.

11107
04:35:40,830 --> 04:35:41,130
I'm coming to you.

11108
04:35:41,130 --> 04:35:41,590
I'm coming to you now.

11109
04:35:42,610 --> 04:35:43,330
I can't.

11110
04:35:43,330 --> 04:35:43,970
Oh, sorry.

11111
04:35:44,170 --> 04:35:44,210
He's dead.

11112
04:35:44,870 --> 04:35:46,190
You can res me.

11113
04:35:46,290 --> 04:35:47,010
He's resing.

11114
04:35:47,030 --> 04:35:47,350
He's resing.

11115
04:35:47,390 --> 04:35:47,870
Oh no.

11116
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:49,770
Oh my god.

11117
04:35:49,870 --> 04:35:50,230
No.

11118
04:35:50,670 --> 04:35:51,310
That team.

11119
04:35:51,670 --> 04:35:52,690
No, we should have stayed.

11120
04:35:52,750 --> 04:35:53,750
We should have stayed.

11121
04:35:53,910 --> 04:35:54,150
Yeah.

11122
04:35:54,310 --> 04:35:54,650
Yeah.

11123
04:35:57,290 --> 04:35:58,010
That team.

11124
04:35:58,170 --> 04:35:58,790
That team.

11125
04:35:58,790 --> 04:35:59,270
Are you...

11126
04:35:59,270 --> 04:36:00,250
Are you flat?

11127
04:36:01,750 --> 04:36:02,350
You didn't check.

11128
04:36:02,390 --> 04:36:04,070
Click on the rank and see if you're flat.

11129
04:36:04,630 --> 04:36:05,350
Click on rank.

11130
04:36:05,370 --> 04:36:05,830
Let me check.

11131
04:36:06,130 --> 04:36:06,890
Let me check.

11132
04:36:08,150 --> 04:36:08,790
Not yet.

11133
04:36:09,150 --> 04:36:09,530
Yeah.

11134
04:36:09,550 --> 04:36:10,050
How much?

11135
04:36:10,090 --> 04:36:10,490
Really?

11136
04:36:10,750 --> 04:36:11,710
How much more?

11137
04:36:13,030 --> 04:36:13,430
150.

11138
04:36:14,530 --> 04:36:15,050
It's okay.

11139
04:36:15,590 --> 04:36:15,990
150?

11140
04:36:16,450 --> 04:36:16,810
Yeah.

11141
04:36:17,350 --> 04:36:18,090
It's okay.

11142
04:36:18,490 --> 04:36:19,710
Oh my god.

11143
04:36:20,630 --> 04:36:21,950
We need one win.

11144
04:36:22,690 --> 04:36:24,450
We need one win.

11145
04:36:24,890 --> 04:36:25,270
Okay.

11146
04:36:25,270 --> 04:36:26,050
We'll win this one.

11147
04:36:26,250 --> 04:36:26,650
All right.

11148
04:36:26,690 --> 04:36:27,290
We can do it.

11149
04:36:27,410 --> 04:36:27,970
I should have stayed.

11150
04:36:28,090 --> 04:36:28,810
I should have kept my...

11151
04:36:28,810 --> 04:36:30,610
I should have kept my triple take.

11152
04:36:31,030 --> 04:36:31,530
I should have kept my triple take.

11153
04:36:31,530 --> 04:36:31,590
I should have kept my triple take.

11154
04:36:31,590 --> 04:36:31,730
I should have kept my triple take.

11155
04:36:31,730 --> 04:36:34,010
I was so happy getting the longbow.

11156
04:36:36,330 --> 04:36:39,590
I should have played with my triple take.

11157
04:36:40,150 --> 04:36:40,390
It's okay.

11158
04:36:40,970 --> 04:36:43,150
We get another one this round.

11159
04:36:47,450 --> 04:36:48,630
It's always...

11160
04:36:48,630 --> 04:36:51,390
Always the triple take and the longbow.

11161
04:36:52,290 --> 04:36:54,030
I see gold longbow.

11162
04:36:58,430 --> 04:36:59,090
I...

11163
04:36:59,090 --> 04:36:59,710
I don't...

11164
04:36:59,710 --> 04:37:01,330
I don't play longbow actually.

11165
04:37:01,850 --> 04:37:02,590
Oh, longbow is fun.

11166
04:37:02,590 --> 04:37:03,790
I haven't played longbow in a long time.

11167
04:37:03,830 --> 04:37:05,490
I mean, when you have the gold sight...

11168
04:37:05,490 --> 04:37:05,630
Really?

11169
04:37:05,630 --> 04:37:06,510
It's just the gold sight.

11170
04:37:06,650 --> 04:37:07,690
The gold sight is fun.

11171
04:37:07,770 --> 04:37:08,550
Oh, the gold sight.

11172
04:37:08,830 --> 04:37:09,090
Yeah.

11173
04:37:09,190 --> 04:37:09,390
Yeah.

11174
04:37:09,670 --> 04:37:11,930
When you get the gold sight, it's like, oh, I want it.

11175
04:37:13,750 --> 04:37:14,830
You can see everything?

11176
04:37:15,090 --> 04:37:15,350
Yeah.

11177
04:37:15,690 --> 04:37:17,370
It's just so fun to see everything.

11178
04:37:19,670 --> 04:37:20,070
No.

11179
04:37:26,130 --> 04:37:27,790
We need either...

11180
04:37:27,790 --> 04:37:29,990
Yeah, we need Ditto to get a lot of kills.

11181
04:37:30,470 --> 04:37:31,950
The moment she hits 150...

11182
04:37:32,330 --> 04:37:34,170
We know it's over.

11183
04:37:36,170 --> 04:37:36,890
Probably.

11184
04:37:37,150 --> 04:37:39,090
Oh, that was Syphon.

11185
04:37:40,930 --> 04:37:41,650
Yeah.

11186
04:37:41,830 --> 04:37:44,350
Oh, Carbine.

11187
04:37:45,570 --> 04:37:47,310
Carbine is not that...

11188
04:37:49,890 --> 04:37:51,330
There is...

11189
04:37:51,330 --> 04:37:52,530
Wait, there's not a song.

11190
04:37:53,390 --> 04:37:54,450
It's only...

11191
04:37:54,450 --> 04:37:54,770
What?

11192
04:37:55,190 --> 04:37:56,670
It's just long range.

11193
04:37:56,970 --> 04:37:58,790
Wait, they're landing together.

11194
04:37:59,390 --> 04:37:59,930
What?

11195
04:38:00,070 --> 04:38:00,330
Oh.

11196
04:38:01,110 --> 04:38:01,510
Yeah.

11197
04:38:01,790 --> 04:38:02,970
The two teams.

11198
04:38:03,090 --> 04:38:03,670
All of them.

11199
04:38:04,190 --> 04:38:04,790
All of them.

11200
04:38:04,850 --> 04:38:05,670
All three teams.

11201
04:38:05,890 --> 04:38:06,790
Three teams?

11202
04:38:07,310 --> 04:38:07,910
Okay, I'm coming over.

11203
04:38:08,010 --> 04:38:08,270
I'm coming over.

11204
04:38:08,490 --> 04:38:09,870
They all landed together.

11205
04:38:10,310 --> 04:38:10,710
Okay.

11206
04:38:10,770 --> 04:38:11,590
I'm heading over.

11207
04:38:13,750 --> 04:38:14,550
One guy.

11208
04:38:16,750 --> 04:38:17,150
Why?

11209
04:38:17,250 --> 04:38:17,630
They...

11210
04:38:17,630 --> 04:38:18,850
But they didn't fight.

11211
04:38:19,170 --> 04:38:19,610
What is that?

11212
04:38:19,710 --> 04:38:20,170
They're not fighting.

11213
04:38:20,190 --> 04:38:21,150
Oh, they're not fighting.

11214
04:38:21,250 --> 04:38:21,930
They're not fighting.

11215
04:38:21,930 --> 04:38:22,150
They're not fighting.

11216
04:38:22,150 --> 04:38:22,230
Okay, okay, okay.

11217
04:38:22,350 --> 04:38:22,690
Now.

11218
04:38:23,890 --> 04:38:24,670
It was slow.

11219
04:38:25,050 --> 04:38:25,450
Okay.

11220
04:38:27,170 --> 04:38:27,930
Do you want to go?

11221
04:38:28,370 --> 04:38:29,070
Yeah, I'm ready.

11222
04:38:29,150 --> 04:38:29,410
I'm ready.

11223
04:38:31,150 --> 04:38:32,650
Okay, let's go together.

11224
04:38:32,870 --> 04:38:33,270
Yeah.

11225
04:38:34,010 --> 04:38:34,610
All right.

11226
04:38:34,630 --> 04:38:35,310
I'm heading over.

11227
04:38:35,470 --> 04:38:36,390
Wait, there's one guy on top.

11228
04:38:36,510 --> 04:38:36,670
Ditto.

11229
04:38:38,210 --> 04:38:39,010
Oh, wait.

11230
04:38:39,150 --> 04:38:39,330
Wait.

11231
04:38:39,350 --> 04:38:41,010
Yeah, I heard that here.

11232
04:38:41,110 --> 04:38:42,190
Yeah, how did I get burned?

11233
04:38:42,230 --> 04:38:42,770
I was like...

11234
04:38:42,770 --> 04:38:43,490
I was like running.

11235
04:38:43,670 --> 04:38:44,910
You're so far from it.

11236
04:38:45,410 --> 04:38:46,230
High five, one.

11237
04:38:48,550 --> 04:38:49,090
Three of them.

11238
04:38:49,090 --> 04:38:49,590
Be careful.

11239
04:38:50,050 --> 04:38:50,450
Three of them.

11240
04:38:50,450 --> 04:38:51,130
They didn't fly.

11241
04:38:51,290 --> 04:38:51,550
Watch.

11242
04:38:52,130 --> 04:38:53,330
Oh my god.

11243
04:38:53,510 --> 04:38:53,890
Be careful.

11244
04:38:53,930 --> 04:38:54,270
Be careful.

11245
04:38:54,270 --> 04:38:54,570
Be careful.

11246
04:38:55,590 --> 04:38:57,390
Okay, we'll wait a little bit.

11247
04:38:57,770 --> 04:38:58,430
We wait.

11248
04:38:59,050 --> 04:38:59,390
I like to wait.

11249
04:38:59,390 --> 04:38:59,670
Wait a bit.

11250
04:39:00,270 --> 04:39:01,010
Wait until it knocks.

11251
04:39:01,290 --> 04:39:01,350

04:39:07,870 --> 04:39:08,250
They're down.

11263
04:39:08,490 --> 04:39:09,570
Some people are down here.

11264
04:39:09,610 --> 04:39:10,070
I saw a knock.

11265
04:39:10,130 --> 04:39:10,310
I saw a knock.

11266
04:39:10,330 --> 04:39:10,930

Okay.

11329
04:40:08,070 --> 04:40:08,210
Okay.

11330
04:40:08,210 --> 04:40:08,390
Okay.

11331
04:40:09,450 --> 04:40:09,930
Body.

11332
04:40:09,930 --> 04:40:10,310
Cute.

11333
04:40:10,530 --> 04:40:11,170
My body.

11334
04:40:13,030 --> 04:40:14,910
It's a sacrifice I had to make.

11335
04:40:17,390 --> 04:40:19,050
Let me grab...

11336
04:40:19,050 --> 04:40:20,230
Grab a car.

11337
04:40:22,510 --> 04:40:22,990
Wait.

11338
04:40:24,070 --> 04:40:25,830
You said there were three squads.

11339
04:40:26,170 --> 04:40:26,990
Wait let me check.

11340
04:40:27,050 --> 04:40:27,290

04:40:27,470 --> 04:40:28,270
I remembered.

11342
04:40:28,450 --> 04:40:29,630
It was like three squads.

11343
04:40:29,770 --> 04:40:30,610
Wait there's no...

11344
04:40:30,610 --> 04:40:31,270
They're all dead.

11345
04:40:31,350 --> 04:40:31,750
No squad?

11346
04:40:32,030 --> 04:40:32,350
No squad?

11347
04:40:32,410 --> 04:40:32,810
Okay.

11348
04:40:32,810 --> 04:40:32,930
Okay.

11349
04:40:34,560 --> 04:40:34,930
That's good.

11350
04:40:35,090 --> 04:40:36,110
That's what we needed.

11351
04:40:36,290 --> 04:40:36,350
That's good.

11352
04:40:37,050 --> 04:40:37,590
Yeah.

11354
04:40:40,490 --> 04:40:41,030
Nice!

11355
04:40:41,610 --> 04:40:43,630

11356
04:40:44,690 --> 04:40:45,230
Wow.

11357
04:40:45,350 --> 04:40:46,750
We are so good.

11358
04:40:47,130 --> 04:40:47,570

11359
04:40:49,650 --> 04:40:51,130
Oh my god, they looted this too.

11360
04:40:54,450 --> 04:40:56,110
Do you need bats, guys?

11361
04:40:56,730 --> 04:40:58,010
I have two.

11362
04:40:58,130 --> 04:40:58,850
I have zero.

11363
04:40:59,670 --> 04:41:01,090
I'll give you some.

11364
04:41:01,090 --> 04:41:02,350
Are you here, Dokie?

11365
04:41:02,450 --> 04:41:02,730
Where are you?

11366
04:41:02,870 --> 04:41:03,750
I'm all the way here.

11367
04:41:04,170 --> 04:41:05,350
Do you need this?

11368
04:41:05,530 --> 04:41:07,910
I need some light, I think.

11369
04:41:08,050 --> 04:41:08,350
Light?

11370
04:41:08,630 --> 04:41:08,830
Okay.

11371
04:41:09,970 --> 04:41:11,590
I can give you...

11372
04:41:11,590 --> 04:41:12,790
I can craft.

11373
04:41:13,450 --> 04:41:15,330

11374
04:41:15,990 --> 04:41:16,630
Oh, yeah.

11375
04:41:16,630 --> 04:41:17,290
You should.

11376
04:41:18,510 --> 04:41:19,670
You don't need a craft.

11377
04:41:19,730 --> 04:41:20,530
That was 300.

11378
04:41:21,050 --> 04:41:22,590
Okay, 1,020.

11379
04:41:23,630 --> 04:41:24,590

04:41:28,050 --> 04:41:28,550
Alright.

11382
04:41:29,630 --> 04:41:30,630
Where do we go?

11383
04:41:31,470 --> 04:41:32,270
That's a lot.

11384
04:41:32,530 --> 04:41:32,790
That's a lot.

11385
04:41:32,790 --> 04:41:33,350
Holy shit.

11386
04:41:33,470 --> 04:41:34,090
That's a lot.

11387
04:41:34,230 --> 04:41:34,330
What the fuck?

11388
04:41:34,850 --> 04:41:35,850
I have 300.

11389
04:41:36,310 --> 04:41:36,890
Are you in...

11390
04:41:36,890 --> 04:41:38,150
You're not even running double light.

11391
04:41:38,470 --> 04:41:39,030
You're not...

11392
04:41:39,030 --> 04:41:40,430
You just have 300.

11393
04:41:41,770 --> 04:41:41,870
No.

11394
04:41:43,310 --> 04:41:43,770
Ooh.

11395
04:41:44,470 --> 04:41:45,730
Dokie, do you want more bats?

11396
04:41:45,870 --> 04:41:46,830
There's not more bats here.

11397
04:41:47,170 --> 04:41:48,110
No, I'm okay.

11398
04:41:48,750 --> 04:41:49,750
Oh, wait.

11399
04:41:49,870 --> 04:41:50,890
I'm gonna scan the ring.

11400
04:41:51,190 --> 04:41:51,610
Okay.

11401
04:41:51,650 --> 04:41:52,570
Look at it.

11402
04:41:52,590 --> 04:41:52,910
Grab it.

11403
04:41:53,030 --> 04:41:55,590
Yeah, I don't have a beacon here.

11404
04:41:55,670 --> 04:41:56,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11405
04:41:56,290 --> 04:41:56,750
Okay.

11406
04:41:56,790 --> 04:41:57,710
There's nobody here anymore.

11407
04:41:57,710 --> 04:41:58,070
You know what?

11408
04:41:58,110 --> 04:41:58,490
I'll...

11409
04:41:59,090 --> 04:41:59,450
Really?

11410
04:41:59,710 --> 04:42:00,070
Yeah.

11411
04:42:00,190 --> 04:42:01,270
Wait, there's one squad.

11412
04:42:02,050 --> 04:42:02,750
There's one squad.

11413
04:42:02,830 --> 04:42:02,850
There's one squad.

11414
04:42:02,850 --> 04:42:03,130
Oh, no.

11415
04:42:04,170 --> 04:42:04,890
She's out.

11416
04:42:05,650 --> 04:42:06,370
Fake news.

11417
04:42:06,790 --> 04:42:07,290
Let me check.

11418
04:42:07,470 --> 04:42:08,110
Let me check.

11419
04:42:08,310 --> 04:42:08,530
Okay.

11420
04:42:08,890 --> 04:42:09,950
I don't see them here.

11421
04:42:10,070 --> 04:42:11,390
Yeah, how was I supposed to know?

11422
04:42:12,350 --> 04:42:12,770
They're here.

11423
04:42:12,950 --> 04:42:13,530
They just came.

11424
04:42:13,910 --> 04:42:14,610
They're gonna loot.

11425
04:42:14,690 --> 04:42:15,150
They're gonna loot.

11426
04:42:15,290 --> 04:42:16,050
We can fight.

11427
04:42:16,210 --> 04:42:16,550
We can fight.

11428
04:42:16,630 --> 04:42:17,170
I can EMP.

11429
04:42:18,130 --> 04:42:18,490
Okay.

11430
04:42:18,510 --> 04:42:19,170
Don't EMP yet.

11431
04:42:19,170 --> 04:42:19,750
Wait until we're closer.

11432
04:42:19,910 --> 04:42:20,190
Only one?

11433
04:42:20,390 --> 04:42:20,990
Wait, wait, wait.

11434
04:42:21,270 --> 04:42:22,050
I can't.

11435
04:42:22,270 --> 04:42:22,850
They're white.

11436
04:42:22,870 --> 04:42:23,630
They're white.

11437
04:42:23,630 --> 04:42:24,050
Oh, okay.

11438
04:42:24,050 --> 04:42:24,810
Okay, so they're babies.

11439
04:42:24,850 --> 04:42:25,210
They're babies.

11440
04:42:25,790 --> 04:42:26,110
Okay.

11441
04:42:26,230 --> 04:42:26,730
Only one?

11442
04:42:26,770 --> 04:42:27,250
Yeah, they're babies.

11443
04:42:27,330 --> 04:42:28,050
They're looting here.

11444
04:42:28,170 --> 04:42:28,950
Yeah, they want loot.

11445
04:42:29,050 --> 04:42:29,910
They want loot because they're babies.

11446
04:42:30,830 --> 04:42:31,470
I hear them.

11447
04:42:31,510 --> 04:42:31,830
I hear them.

11448
04:42:31,850 --> 04:42:32,170
I hear them.

11449
04:42:32,910 --> 04:42:33,230
Gas?

11450
04:42:33,890 --> 04:42:34,410
There's gas?

11451
04:42:35,310 --> 04:42:35,710
On me.

11452
04:42:36,230 --> 04:42:37,150
You mean Caustic?

11453
04:42:37,230 --> 04:42:37,610
Yeah, yeah.

11454
04:42:37,610 --> 04:42:38,250
Caustic, Caustic, Caustic.

11455
04:42:39,310 --> 04:42:39,630
Wait.

11456
04:42:40,030 --> 04:42:40,650
Behind me?

11457
04:42:41,590 --> 04:42:42,470
Oh, my God.

11458
04:42:42,550 --> 04:42:44,150
There was a guy right behind me.

11459
04:42:44,570 --> 04:42:45,070
Over here.

11460
04:42:45,110 --> 04:42:45,350
Over here.

11461
04:42:45,470 --> 04:42:45,730
Whoa.

11462
04:42:46,010 --> 04:42:46,330
Goodbye.

11463
04:42:48,490 --> 04:42:49,130
It's not low.

11464
04:42:50,190 --> 04:42:50,630
I'm coming.

11465
04:42:50,690 --> 04:42:51,050
They don't...

11466
04:42:51,050 --> 04:42:52,150
He's so low.

11467
04:42:52,310 --> 04:42:52,990
Too low.

11468
04:42:53,090 --> 04:42:53,490
Too low.

11469
04:42:54,350 --> 04:42:54,790
Don't worry.

11470
04:42:54,870 --> 04:42:55,470
I'm coming back soon.

11471
04:42:55,490 --> 04:42:56,070
I'm almost there.

11472
04:42:57,870 --> 04:42:58,450
Too low.

11473
04:42:58,530 --> 04:42:58,850
Too low.

11474
04:42:58,890 --> 04:42:59,790
Okay, down, down, down.

11475
04:42:59,990 --> 04:43:00,510
Down, down, down.

11476
04:43:00,510 --> 04:43:00,810
Down, down, down.

11477
04:43:00,830 --> 04:43:01,430
Nice last guy.

11478
04:43:02,750 --> 04:43:03,630
Nice last guy.

11479
04:43:03,630 --> 04:43:03,670
Okay.

11480
04:43:04,390 --> 04:43:05,010
Hey, guys.

11481
04:43:05,090 --> 04:43:05,270
I'm back.

11482
04:43:05,610 --> 04:43:06,110
Wait, wait, wait.

11483
04:43:06,150 --> 04:43:06,790
Me come back?

11484
04:43:08,850 --> 04:43:09,950
Oh, my God.

11485
04:43:12,030 --> 04:43:13,130
You guys, I'm saved.

11486
04:43:17,730 --> 04:43:19,150
There's so many things here.

11487
04:43:19,170 --> 04:43:19,450
Wait, here.

11488
04:43:19,530 --> 04:43:19,930
Gold knock.

11489
04:43:20,210 --> 04:43:20,830
What the fuck?

11490
04:43:20,830 --> 04:43:21,030
What the fuck?

11491
04:43:21,850 --> 04:43:22,690
Why were they...

11492
04:43:22,690 --> 04:43:24,650
How are they, like, poor and rich at the same time?

11493
04:43:24,650 --> 04:43:25,090
I thought they were solo.

11494
04:43:25,950 --> 04:43:26,550
Oh, my God.

11495
04:43:26,570 --> 04:43:27,470
The guy was behind me.

11496
04:43:27,530 --> 04:43:28,250
Dude, they had nothing?

11497
04:43:28,930 --> 04:43:32,230
They had, like, white armor, but they had items.

11498
04:43:32,350 --> 04:43:32,550
Yeah.

11499
04:43:32,670 --> 04:43:34,090
They were fucking goaded.

11500
04:43:34,110 --> 04:43:35,010
What the heck?

11501
04:43:35,030 --> 04:43:36,430
There's so much stuff in here.

11502
04:43:36,430 --> 04:43:37,570
I need energy armor.

11503
04:43:38,430 --> 04:43:39,130
Here, here, here.

11504
04:43:39,150 --> 04:43:39,410
Energy.

11505
04:43:39,450 --> 04:43:40,610
There's a lot of energy here, too.

11506
04:43:40,790 --> 04:43:41,110
Yeah.

11507
04:43:41,170 --> 04:43:42,090
Okay, okay, okay.

11508
04:43:42,090 --> 04:43:42,510
Okay.

11509
04:43:42,510 --> 04:43:43,070
I got it.

11510
04:43:43,790 --> 04:43:44,430
Oh, hell.

11511
04:43:44,650 --> 04:43:44,870
Okay.

11512
04:43:44,930 --> 04:43:45,590
I lived.

11513
04:43:47,110 --> 04:43:47,750
Let's see.

11514
04:43:49,450 --> 04:43:51,010
I died right next to you.

11515
04:43:51,010 --> 04:43:51,610
I died right next to the cart.

11516
04:43:51,790 --> 04:43:52,030
No, Scott.

11517
04:43:52,870 --> 04:43:53,470
No, Scott.

11518
04:43:53,490 --> 04:43:53,810
Okay.

11519
04:43:53,810 --> 04:43:54,590
You can scan ring now.

11520
04:43:55,070 --> 04:43:55,450
Okay.

11521
04:43:55,450 --> 04:43:56,150
Yeah, you can scan it now.

11522
04:43:56,330 --> 04:43:56,690
No, Scott.

11523
04:43:56,870 --> 04:43:57,070
Okay.

11524
04:43:58,210 --> 04:43:58,770
I live.

11525
04:43:59,710 --> 04:44:00,230
All right.

11526
04:44:00,250 --> 04:44:01,570
While you scan, I'll get the Evo.

11527
04:44:02,070 --> 04:44:02,650
I live.

11528
04:44:03,050 --> 04:44:03,430
Okay.

11529
04:44:06,050 --> 04:44:07,530
Dorky, give me some dawn.

11530
04:44:08,650 --> 04:44:09,030
Dawn.

11531
04:44:09,170 --> 04:44:09,390
Dawn.

11532
04:44:09,630 --> 04:44:10,690
You're just...

11533
04:44:10,690 --> 04:44:10,970
What?

11534
04:44:11,050 --> 04:44:12,170
You're just one HP.

11535
04:44:12,230 --> 04:44:12,890
Come over here.

11536
04:44:13,210 --> 04:44:13,990
Come over here.

11537
04:44:14,030 --> 04:44:14,650
And then you get it.

11538
04:44:14,970 --> 04:44:15,970
You have to come over here.

11539
04:44:16,870 --> 04:44:17,250
Ooh.

11540
04:44:17,370 --> 04:44:17,550
Wait.

11541
04:44:17,590 --> 04:44:18,010
That's a PK.

11542
04:44:18,010 --> 04:44:19,050
I don't like the PK.

11543
04:44:20,310 --> 04:44:20,690
Oh.

11544
04:44:20,850 --> 04:44:20,990
Oh.

11545
04:44:21,530 --> 04:44:22,650
Put the dawn there.

11546
04:44:23,770 --> 04:44:24,510
Let's see.

11547
04:44:24,850 --> 04:44:26,090
Oh, I don't like this.

11548
04:44:26,190 --> 04:44:27,170
I don't like this.

11549
04:44:27,210 --> 04:44:27,870
You don't like PK?

11550
04:44:27,990 --> 04:44:28,250
This ring.

11551
04:44:28,490 --> 04:44:29,250
Oh, the ring.

11552
04:44:29,270 --> 04:44:29,350
Oh.

11553
04:44:29,350 --> 04:44:29,470
No, no.

11554
04:44:29,490 --> 04:44:30,350
I mean, the ring.

11555
04:44:30,350 --> 04:44:31,110
The ring is...

11556
04:44:32,190 --> 04:44:33,190
It's hard to panic.

11557
04:44:33,830 --> 04:44:34,630
That's true.

11558
04:44:34,930 --> 04:44:35,610
Oh, yeah.

11559
04:44:35,710 --> 04:44:36,430
I should...

11560
04:44:36,430 --> 04:44:38,550
I don't like landslides.

11561
04:44:38,550 --> 04:44:38,930
Wait.

11562
04:44:38,930 --> 04:44:39,710
There's no one with the PK?

11563
04:44:39,710 --> 04:44:40,410
Pick a countdown.

11564
04:44:40,530 --> 04:44:43,690
Ditto, I'll give you the tower, Ditto.

11565
04:44:44,010 --> 04:44:44,450
Okay.

11566
04:44:44,450 --> 04:44:44,710
Okay.

11567
04:44:44,750 --> 04:44:45,430
Yeah, you give me this.

11568
04:44:45,650 --> 04:44:46,870
Does no one want the PK?

11569
04:44:47,950 --> 04:44:48,390
No.

11570
04:44:48,630 --> 04:44:49,070
Okay.

11571
04:44:49,190 --> 04:44:49,830
I'm gonna do it.

11572
04:44:51,010 --> 04:44:51,450
Really?

11573
04:44:51,730 --> 04:44:51,910
Yeah.

11574
04:44:52,030 --> 04:44:54,190
I'm gonna do it with like 200 ping.

11575
04:44:56,710 --> 04:44:57,150
Let's go.

11576
04:44:58,530 --> 04:45:00,210
Oh, you have 200 ping?

11577
04:45:00,430 --> 04:45:01,150
No, I have 100.

11578
04:45:01,350 --> 04:45:01,910
100 ping.

11579
04:45:03,330 --> 04:45:04,310
120, I think.

11580
04:45:04,430 --> 04:45:06,070
That's usually how much ping I get.

11581
04:45:06,090 --> 04:45:07,430
Do you need energy?

11582
04:45:07,750 --> 04:45:08,130
Ditto.

11583
04:45:08,610 --> 04:45:09,010
Okay.

11584
04:45:09,130 --> 04:45:09,890
Which way are we gonna go?

11585
04:45:10,090 --> 04:45:10,250
I'm good.

11586
04:45:11,310 --> 04:45:13,110
We go countdown.

11587
04:45:14,150 --> 04:45:14,550
Countdown?

11588
04:45:14,690 --> 04:45:14,950
All right.

11589
04:45:15,310 --> 04:45:16,070
Yeah, countdown.

11590
04:45:16,210 --> 04:45:16,670
Let's look.

11591
04:45:16,970 --> 04:45:17,650
Valerie here.

11592
04:45:19,070 --> 04:45:19,870
Oh, my God.

11593
04:45:19,970 --> 04:45:20,990
Let me place my...

11594
04:45:20,990 --> 04:45:21,370
Dang.

11595
04:45:21,670 --> 04:45:22,250
All right.

11596
04:45:22,250 --> 04:45:23,510
Who wants the red armor?

11597
04:45:25,310 --> 04:45:26,610
You can grab it.

11598
04:45:26,710 --> 04:45:27,510
Oh, I can?

11599
04:45:27,770 --> 04:45:28,070
Okay.

11600
04:45:28,570 --> 04:45:29,510
I need it.

11601
04:45:29,530 --> 04:45:29,810
Yeah.

11602
04:45:30,270 --> 04:45:31,410
I need it the most.

11603
04:45:33,070 --> 04:45:35,470
If I'm going in with my PK...

11604
04:45:35,470 --> 04:45:36,790
Oh, there's another gold rose.

11605
04:45:37,870 --> 04:45:38,350
Okay.

11606
04:45:38,630 --> 04:45:38,890
Yeah.

11607
04:45:39,010 --> 04:45:39,450
Yeah.

11608
04:45:39,450 --> 04:45:39,570
Yeah.

11609
04:45:39,570 --> 04:45:40,030
Yeah.

11610
04:45:40,030 --> 04:45:40,410
Yeah.

11611
04:45:40,450 --> 04:45:40,930
Yeah.

11612
04:45:40,930 --> 04:45:41,070
Yeah.

11613
04:45:41,070 --> 04:45:41,190
Yeah.

11614
04:45:41,270 --> 04:45:41,450
Yeah.

11615
04:45:41,450 --> 04:45:41,550
Yeah.

11616
04:45:41,670 --> 04:45:42,150
Yeah.

11617
04:45:42,150 --> 04:45:42,210
Yeah.

11618
04:45:42,210 --> 04:45:42,310
Yeah.

11619
04:45:42,310 --> 04:45:42,450
Yeah.

11620
04:45:42,650 --> 04:45:43,130
Yeah.

11621
04:45:43,130 --> 04:45:43,150
I'm gonna go.

11622
04:45:43,150 --> 04:45:45,770
Oh, I don't like to this way and this way.

11623
04:45:46,030 --> 04:45:48,530
We should go this way.

11624
04:45:48,550 --> 04:45:48,930
We go.

11625
04:45:48,970 --> 04:45:49,710
See if we can get to landslide.

11626
04:45:50,810 --> 04:45:51,330
Okay.

11627
04:45:51,490 --> 04:45:54,390
Let's see if there's no one in landslide.

11628
04:45:54,730 --> 04:46:01,310
But I think there might be people at landslide.

11629
04:46:01,310 --> 04:46:05,290
We can go here and see if Hiro scans anybody.

11630
04:46:05,870 --> 04:46:06,630
Oh, yeah.

11631
04:46:06,630 --> 04:46:07,010
Okay.

11632
04:46:07,010 --> 04:46:07,290
Yeah.

11633
04:46:07,390 --> 04:46:08,330
If Hiro scans somebody.

11634
04:46:08,330 --> 04:46:09,310
Oh, my gosh.

11635
04:46:09,550 --> 04:46:10,170
Do he?

11636
04:46:10,670 --> 04:46:11,190
What?

11637
04:46:11,310 --> 04:46:12,370
You are so smart.

11638
04:46:12,630 --> 04:46:13,010
I know.

11639
04:46:15,590 --> 04:46:16,310
I know.

11640
04:46:16,470 --> 04:46:17,090
I know.

11641
04:46:17,350 --> 04:46:18,150
You are so smart.

11642
04:46:18,650 --> 04:46:19,330
Let's see.

11643
04:46:19,530 --> 04:46:20,210
I'll grab this.

11644
04:46:20,810 --> 04:46:21,430
Sounds like...

11645
04:46:21,430 --> 04:46:21,730
Okay.

11646
04:46:22,390 --> 04:46:23,130
That's gun sound.

11647
04:46:23,530 --> 04:46:24,190
That's gun sound.

11648
04:46:24,530 --> 04:46:24,930
Okay.

11649
04:46:24,930 --> 04:46:27,630
We gotta wait for Hiro to see how many teams are around.

11650
04:46:27,670 --> 04:46:29,630
I will go grab evil harvester.

11651
04:46:29,870 --> 04:46:30,310
Yeah.

11652
04:46:30,470 --> 04:46:31,050
And from the same...

11653
04:46:31,050 --> 04:46:31,610
Nobody near.

11654
04:46:31,910 --> 04:46:32,590
Nobody near.

11655
04:46:32,690 --> 04:46:33,810
Then we could go through this.

11656
04:46:34,370 --> 04:46:34,810
Yeah.

11657
04:46:34,950 --> 04:46:35,930
We should be able to go through this.

11658
04:46:35,930 --> 04:46:36,110
Yeah.

11659
04:46:36,630 --> 04:46:37,530
Where do you wanna go?

11660
04:46:37,950 --> 04:46:39,070
There's one team there.

11661
04:46:39,610 --> 04:46:41,410
You wanna fight or do you wanna...

11662
04:46:41,410 --> 04:46:42,110
This way.

11663
04:46:42,310 --> 04:46:42,970
Oh, I'm gonna go this way.

11664
04:46:42,970 --> 04:46:43,110
Oh, I'm gonna go this way.

11665
04:46:43,130 --> 04:46:44,010
Oh, I think...

11666
04:46:44,010 --> 04:46:45,490
Oh, Ditto wants to fight now.

11667
04:46:45,650 --> 04:46:45,850
Can you...

11668
04:46:47,290 --> 04:46:48,290
Can you scan there?

11669
04:46:49,090 --> 04:46:49,450
Where?

11670
04:46:49,610 --> 04:46:49,970
Okay.

11671
04:46:51,010 --> 04:46:51,570
Oh, yeah.

11672
04:46:51,630 --> 04:46:51,750
Here?

11673
04:46:51,910 --> 04:46:52,110
Okay.

11674
04:46:52,430 --> 04:46:53,350
It's kind of far.

11675
04:46:53,490 --> 04:46:53,710
Yeah.

11676
04:46:53,810 --> 04:46:54,390
I quit.

11677
04:46:55,210 --> 04:46:55,570
It's scanned.

11678
04:46:55,570 --> 04:46:56,190
Oh, there's a team.

11679
04:46:56,230 --> 04:46:57,110
There's a team here too.

11680
04:46:57,290 --> 04:46:57,490
Yeah.

11681
04:46:57,510 --> 04:46:58,290
Ditto, you wanna go?

11682
04:46:59,170 --> 04:47:00,050
There's a team there too.

11683
04:47:01,890 --> 04:47:04,790
We could just wait until it closes.

11684
04:47:04,910 --> 04:47:05,130
Okay.

11685
04:47:05,130 --> 04:47:05,270
Let me check.

11686
04:47:05,790 --> 04:47:06,150
Yeah.

11687
04:47:06,270 --> 04:47:06,630
Okay.

11688
04:47:06,870 --> 04:47:07,570
There's blue armor by there.

11689
04:47:07,590 --> 04:47:08,110
I cracked him.

11690
04:47:09,190 --> 04:47:10,630
I cracked him from all the way here.

11691
04:47:10,690 --> 04:47:11,130
The blue armor.

11692
04:47:11,310 --> 04:47:12,510
Let me try and scan.

11693
04:47:12,890 --> 04:47:13,070
Okay.

11694
04:47:14,110 --> 04:47:14,390
Yeah.

11695
04:47:14,550 --> 04:47:16,630
I'm gonna look behind us here too, just in case.

11696
04:47:16,870 --> 04:47:17,150
Okay.

11697
04:47:17,270 --> 04:47:17,550
Okay.

11698
04:47:17,550 --> 04:47:18,030
Team, team, team, team, team.

11699
04:47:18,110 --> 04:47:19,250
Team, team, team, team, team, team, team, team, team.

11700
04:47:19,570 --> 04:47:19,850
Yeah.

11701
04:47:19,870 --> 04:47:21,190
We have to focus on this.

11702
04:47:21,190 --> 04:47:21,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11703
04:47:21,290 --> 04:47:21,570
Yeah.

11704
04:47:21,690 --> 04:47:22,290
Make them back up.

11705
04:47:22,350 --> 04:47:22,750
Maybe one.

11706
04:47:23,010 --> 04:47:23,890
Maybe one, I think.

11707
04:47:23,950 --> 04:47:24,130
No, no.

11708
04:47:24,130 --> 04:47:24,550
Three, three, three.

11709
04:47:24,610 --> 04:47:25,070
I saw three.

11710
04:47:25,250 --> 04:47:25,810
One fell.

11711
04:47:25,890 --> 04:47:26,110
Yeah.

11712
04:47:26,110 --> 04:47:26,590
One ran down.

11713
04:47:26,590 --> 04:47:26,930
I'll EMT.

11714
04:47:27,330 --> 04:47:27,690
I'll EMT.

11715
04:47:28,410 --> 04:47:29,070
Yeah, I know.

11716
04:47:29,190 --> 04:47:30,070
Blue, blue, purple.

11717
04:47:30,130 --> 04:47:30,470
Blue, purple.

11718
04:47:31,590 --> 04:47:32,150
Let me check.

11719
04:47:32,650 --> 04:47:33,670
They're all the way down here.

11720
04:47:33,710 --> 04:47:34,290
They're all the way down here.

11721
04:47:35,110 --> 04:47:35,470
They're here.

11722
04:47:37,130 --> 04:47:38,490
Why are they running to us?

11723
04:47:38,510 --> 04:47:39,290
We cracked them.

11724
04:47:43,130 --> 04:47:44,910
Their third ran the different direction.

11725
04:47:47,990 --> 04:47:48,590
Low armor.

11726
04:47:49,190 --> 04:47:50,050
They're trying to run.

11727
04:47:51,350 --> 04:47:51,950
Be careful.

11728
04:47:54,910 --> 04:47:55,610
Flash, flash, flash.

11729
04:47:56,190 --> 04:47:57,490
That's a different squad.

11730
04:47:57,590 --> 04:47:57,850
What?

11731
04:47:58,010 --> 04:47:58,330
No, no, no.

11732
04:47:58,350 --> 04:47:58,890
It's his teammate.

11733
04:48:00,670 --> 04:48:01,290
I got one.

11734
04:48:01,550 --> 04:48:01,870
Oh, fighter.

11735
04:48:02,170 --> 04:48:02,530
Nice.

11736
04:48:03,030 --> 04:48:03,390
Last.

11737
04:48:03,390 --> 04:48:04,670
There's a rev over there.

11738
04:48:04,690 --> 04:48:05,070
I got two.

11739
04:48:06,450 --> 04:48:07,450
Did you give me a Q?

11740
04:48:07,590 --> 04:48:07,950
Yeah.

11741
04:48:08,290 --> 04:48:09,070
All dead, all dead.

11742
04:48:09,150 --> 04:48:10,390
We got Q, we got Q, we got Q.

11743
04:48:10,590 --> 04:48:11,410
Did you give me a Q?

11744
04:48:11,410 --> 04:48:12,730
I don't know if they're all dead though.

11745
04:48:13,130 --> 04:48:13,430
I'm taking one flu.

11746
04:48:14,190 --> 04:48:15,050
Over there, over there.

11747
04:48:15,290 --> 04:48:16,610
We go, we go, we go, right?

11748
04:48:16,610 --> 04:48:16,850
We go, right?

11749
04:48:17,190 --> 04:48:17,530
Yeah.

11750
04:48:18,570 --> 04:48:19,410
Don't kick you.

11751
04:48:19,750 --> 04:48:20,090
Drone.

11752
04:48:20,330 --> 04:48:21,090
Oh, sorry.

11753
04:48:23,010 --> 04:48:23,690
Thank you.

11754
04:48:23,870 --> 04:48:26,490
Oh, they get, they get keeping us.

11755
04:48:27,410 --> 04:48:27,890
Yeah, yeah.

11756
04:48:27,950 --> 04:48:28,770
So we have to go this way.

11757
04:48:29,530 --> 04:48:29,870
Okay.

11758
04:48:31,050 --> 04:48:31,990
They get keeping us.

11759
04:48:32,250 --> 04:48:33,110
We can, okay.

11760
04:48:33,470 --> 04:48:34,150
Let me check.

11761
04:48:34,150 --> 04:48:35,230
I think we, let me, let me drone.

11762
04:48:35,470 --> 04:48:36,410
I'll drone, I'll drone.

11763
04:48:36,550 --> 04:48:37,110
I can scan.

11764
04:48:37,270 --> 04:48:38,730
This is zone, this is zone, this is zone, this is zone.

11765
04:48:38,850 --> 04:48:39,190
Yeah.

11766
04:48:39,690 --> 04:48:41,890
Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll throw my drone down here.

11767
04:48:41,970 --> 04:48:42,210
Okay.

11768
04:48:42,550 --> 04:48:42,730
I'm gonna go down here.

11769
04:48:42,750 --> 04:48:43,090
Okay.

11770
04:48:43,090 --> 04:48:43,110
Okay.

11771
04:48:48,390 --> 04:48:48,870
That's a lie.

11772
04:48:49,170 --> 04:48:49,410
Oh.

11773
04:48:51,050 --> 04:48:51,530
No way.

11774
04:48:52,050 --> 04:48:53,750
I saw them, I saw them over here earlier.

11775
04:48:54,530 --> 04:48:55,590
I'm not sure where they are now.

11776
04:48:55,690 --> 04:48:56,850
Wait, I don't see them, actually.

11777
04:48:57,010 --> 04:48:57,690
Yeah, then we can go move up.

11778
04:48:57,690 --> 04:48:58,130
Wait, they're not here.

11779
04:48:58,230 --> 04:48:58,630
They're not here.

11780
04:48:58,710 --> 04:48:59,070
They're not here.

11781
04:48:59,110 --> 04:48:59,310
They're here.

11782
04:48:59,510 --> 04:49:00,090
We gotta get out of the tunnel.

11783
04:49:00,230 --> 04:49:00,670
I don't want to...

11784
04:49:00,670 --> 04:49:02,670
Can, can, can we play on, on the...

11785
04:49:02,670 --> 04:49:03,430
Nobody here, nobody here.

11786
04:49:03,450 --> 04:49:03,750
Nobody here.

11787
04:49:03,910 --> 04:49:04,270
Everybody's here.

11788
04:49:04,450 --> 04:49:04,970
Everybody's fighting there.

11789
04:49:05,770 --> 04:49:06,770
Okay, we can, we can, we can, we can.

11790
04:49:06,770 --> 04:49:07,150
Yeah, we're safe.

11791
04:49:07,170 --> 04:49:07,730
We're safe all there.

11792
04:49:08,150 --> 04:49:08,530
Yeah, yeah.

11793
04:49:08,550 --> 04:49:09,450
Get the ring, get the ring too.

11794
04:49:09,450 --> 04:49:11,030
We take the high guard, we take the high guard.

11795
04:49:11,090 --> 04:49:11,190
Yeah.

11796
04:49:11,190 --> 04:49:13,350
Yeah, you scan the ring because all of them are fighting here.

11797
04:49:13,490 --> 04:49:14,150
Little scan ring.

11798
04:49:14,410 --> 04:49:15,650
Okay, I will scan the ring, okay?

11799
04:49:17,110 --> 04:49:18,150
I'm going to check the package.

11800
04:49:18,790 --> 04:49:19,370
Okay, okay.

11801
04:49:19,850 --> 04:49:20,930
Oh my gosh!

11802
04:49:22,350 --> 04:49:23,210
What the f***?

11803
04:49:23,390 --> 04:49:24,790
1, 2, 3 teams.

11804
04:49:25,050 --> 04:49:25,830
Oh, it's here.

11805
04:49:26,010 --> 04:49:27,530
We should push up here now.

11806
04:49:27,790 --> 04:49:29,330
Okay, okay, okay, I will push up here.

11807
04:49:30,230 --> 04:49:31,330
We care package though.

11808
04:49:31,670 --> 04:49:31,770
Yeah.

11809
04:49:31,990 --> 04:49:32,710
It's a Devo.

11810
04:49:32,870 --> 04:49:33,650
Because I want to get...

11811
04:49:33,650 --> 04:49:34,070
Someone should get...

11812
04:49:34,070 --> 04:49:35,730
No, there's another one coming down here.

11813
04:49:35,830 --> 04:49:36,250
Oh, shit.

11814
04:49:36,490 --> 04:49:37,530
Someone should get the Devo.

11815
04:49:38,690 --> 04:49:39,090
Okay.

11816
04:49:39,150 --> 04:49:40,130
I'll take it, I'll take it.

11817
04:49:40,130 --> 04:49:40,990
You can take it.

11818
04:49:41,230 --> 04:49:42,530
I'll grab... I'll stay here.

11819
04:49:42,570 --> 04:49:44,370
But there's another one here though.

11820
04:49:44,570 --> 04:49:45,530
I will look left.

11821
04:49:45,670 --> 04:49:46,410
I will look left.

11822
04:49:46,410 --> 04:49:47,350
Check what that is first.

11823
04:49:47,470 --> 04:49:48,210
I'm going to look right here.

11824
04:49:50,050 --> 04:49:53,230
Because the last team is here and then another team is here, left side.

11825
04:49:53,350 --> 04:49:54,830
Over there, over there, over there.

11826
04:49:56,150 --> 04:49:56,590
Okay.

11827
04:49:58,150 --> 04:50:00,170
Yeah, I'm going to put my package here too.

11828
04:50:01,070 --> 04:50:02,190
They should know we're here as well.

11829
04:50:02,810 --> 04:50:04,150
Okay, okay, okay.

11830
04:50:04,310 --> 04:50:04,750
Then...

11831
04:50:04,750 --> 04:50:06,870
There are only two teams left.

11832
04:50:07,130 --> 04:50:07,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11833
04:50:08,770 --> 04:50:09,850
Left and right.

11834
04:50:09,850 --> 04:50:11,170
But there's another Devotion.

11835
04:50:11,470 --> 04:50:11,930
Oh, shit.

11836
04:50:11,990 --> 04:50:13,630
Okay, I'll grab one of the Devotions.

11837
04:50:13,730 --> 04:50:14,430
I'll grab the other Devotion.

11838
04:50:14,430 --> 04:50:15,490
Okay, you take one.

11839
04:50:15,630 --> 04:50:15,930
Okay.

11840
04:50:16,270 --> 04:50:16,850
I'll grab that.

11841
04:50:17,090 --> 04:50:17,990
I'll grab this one then.

11842
04:50:19,010 --> 04:50:20,110
I have a lot of energy.

11843
04:50:20,250 --> 04:50:20,930
Do you guys need it?

11844
04:50:21,310 --> 04:50:21,630
No.

11845
04:50:21,770 --> 04:50:23,830
I'm running PKD.

11846
04:50:24,110 --> 04:50:24,430
Oh.

11847
04:50:25,510 --> 04:50:25,830
Wait.

11848
04:50:26,410 --> 04:50:27,230
Okay, they're there.

11849
04:50:27,470 --> 04:50:27,950
They're there.

11850
04:50:28,910 --> 04:50:29,550
They're fighting.

11851
04:50:29,750 --> 04:50:30,150
They're down.

11852
04:50:30,150 --> 04:50:30,930
Push up, push up, push up.

11853
04:50:31,030 --> 04:50:31,330
They're fighting.

11854
04:50:32,670 --> 04:50:33,370
You gotta push up.

11855
04:50:34,470 --> 04:50:35,230
Hiro, you gotta come up.

11856
04:50:35,270 --> 04:50:35,630
You gotta come up.

11857
04:50:36,350 --> 04:50:37,610
Yeah, I'm a bit far.

11858
04:50:37,890 --> 04:50:38,210
Wait.

11859
04:50:38,310 --> 04:50:38,950
Yeah, just run up.

11860
04:50:38,970 --> 04:50:39,370
Go, go, go.

11861
04:50:39,370 --> 04:50:39,550
They're fighting.

11862
04:50:39,790 --> 04:50:40,030
They're fighting.

11863
04:50:40,210 --> 04:50:40,450
They're fighting.

11864
04:50:41,150 --> 04:50:41,770
Hard fight.

11865
04:50:41,850 --> 04:50:42,130
Hard fight.

11866
04:50:44,030 --> 04:50:45,170
I'll try EMP them.

11867
04:50:50,010 --> 04:50:50,950
Let me EMP.

11868
04:50:51,170 --> 04:50:51,430
Okay.

11869
04:50:51,990 --> 04:50:52,730
I'm on the town.

11870
04:50:53,270 --> 04:50:53,930
EMP left side.

11871
04:50:53,930 --> 04:50:54,050
EMP left side.

11872
04:50:54,490 --> 04:50:54,850
Okay.

11873
04:50:55,390 --> 04:50:55,750
Okay.

11874
04:50:55,750 --> 04:50:55,810
Oh, shit.

11875
04:50:56,290 --> 04:50:56,650
Okay.

11876
04:50:56,690 --> 04:50:57,030
It's fine.

11877
04:50:57,090 --> 04:50:57,210
It's fine.

11878
04:50:57,210 --> 04:50:57,550
I'm okay.

11879
04:50:57,570 --> 04:50:57,870
I'm okay.

11880
04:50:57,890 --> 04:50:58,010
I'm going out.

11881
04:50:58,150 --> 04:50:58,570
I'm going out.

11882
04:50:58,870 --> 04:50:59,230
Yeah.

11883
04:50:59,330 --> 04:50:59,470
Yeah.

11884
04:50:59,590 --> 04:51:00,230
They didn't...

11885
04:51:00,230 --> 04:51:00,630
They got...

11886
04:51:00,630 --> 04:51:01,530
They got one knocked.

11887
04:51:01,750 --> 04:51:02,210
One knocked at first.

11888
04:51:02,210 --> 04:51:02,670
I EMP'd the other one.

11889
04:51:03,110 --> 04:51:03,750
One knocked?

11890
04:51:03,870 --> 04:51:03,970
This...

11891
04:51:03,970 --> 04:51:05,150
We can actually fight here.

11892
04:51:06,870 --> 04:51:07,990
Oh, they're all dead.

11893
04:51:08,110 --> 04:51:08,650
Oh, come.

11894
04:51:08,810 --> 04:51:09,150
Oh.

11895
04:51:10,070 --> 04:51:11,090
They're not dead.

11896
04:51:11,130 --> 04:51:11,870
They're not dead.

11897
04:51:11,870 --> 04:51:12,250
No, no, no.

11898
04:51:12,250 --> 04:51:13,830
We have to focus on the left side too.

11899
04:51:14,010 --> 04:51:14,030
Yeah, I know.

11900
04:51:14,370 --> 04:51:15,970
This one is very hurt.

11901
04:51:16,090 --> 04:51:16,850
Very hurt.

11902
04:51:16,970 --> 04:51:17,150
Yeah.

11903
04:51:18,050 --> 04:51:18,690
I can't...

11904
04:51:18,690 --> 04:51:19,990
I don't have an angle on this team.

11905
04:51:20,150 --> 04:51:21,390
I'm looking at my right just in case.

11906
04:51:21,630 --> 04:51:21,990
Okay.

11907
04:51:22,130 --> 04:51:22,530
Mm-hmm.

11908
04:51:25,010 --> 04:51:25,790
Oh, my God.

11909
04:51:27,590 --> 04:51:28,230
I'm gonna wait.

11910
04:51:28,270 --> 04:51:30,050
I forgot D.Va's recoil is so hard too.

11911
04:51:30,110 --> 04:51:31,370
I'm gonna look at this team for you.

11912
04:51:36,510 --> 04:51:37,230
This team.

11913
04:51:38,030 --> 04:51:38,550
All right.

11914
04:51:39,530 --> 04:51:40,070
See here.

11915
04:51:40,390 --> 04:51:41,470
I'm looking here for us.

11916
04:51:41,470 --> 04:51:41,810
Oh, the Corsi.

11917
04:51:41,810 --> 04:51:42,430
Blue armor.

11918
04:51:42,930 --> 04:51:43,290
Yeah.

11919
04:51:43,290 --> 04:51:43,670
They're all...

11920
04:51:43,670 --> 04:51:44,750
This team is blue as well.

11921
04:51:47,930 --> 04:51:48,370
Oh.

11922
04:51:50,630 --> 04:51:52,610
On the left team.

11923
04:51:52,690 --> 04:51:53,930
Left team have...

11924
04:51:54,650 --> 04:51:56,410
Left team have three people.

11925
04:51:56,490 --> 04:51:57,910
We have to focus on left team.

11926
04:51:58,610 --> 04:51:59,050
Yeah.

11927
04:51:59,210 --> 04:52:00,410
You guys focus on left.

11928
04:52:00,430 --> 04:52:01,610
I'm focusing on right for us.

11929
04:52:01,770 --> 04:52:02,050
Okay.

11930
04:52:03,150 --> 04:52:03,590
Okay.

11931
04:52:04,210 --> 04:52:04,650
Wait.

11932
04:52:04,710 --> 04:52:05,390
One's pushing up little.

11933
04:52:05,610 --> 04:52:06,010
Here.

11934
04:52:06,070 --> 04:52:07,150
Oh, that's fine.

11935
04:52:07,250 --> 04:52:07,550
That's fine.

11936
04:52:07,670 --> 04:52:08,110
Yeah.

11937
04:52:10,870 --> 04:52:11,310
Okay.

11938
04:52:11,590 --> 04:52:12,430
All right, guys.

11939
04:52:12,510 --> 04:52:13,070
Calm down.

11940
04:52:13,150 --> 04:52:13,650
Thank you.

11941
04:52:13,670 --> 04:52:14,050
They're here.

11942
04:52:15,630 --> 04:52:16,670
Can you use the drone?

11943
04:52:17,370 --> 04:52:17,770
Here.

11944
04:52:17,850 --> 04:52:18,030
Yeah.

11945
04:52:18,170 --> 04:52:18,570
Yeah.

11946
04:52:18,610 --> 04:52:18,790
Yeah.

11947
04:52:18,910 --> 04:52:20,010
My drone just broke.

11948
04:52:21,370 --> 04:52:22,730
They're trying to get...

11949
04:52:22,730 --> 04:52:23,610
They're here.

11950
04:52:24,390 --> 04:52:25,130
Oh, okay.

11951
04:52:25,130 --> 04:52:25,410
The one down.

11952
04:52:25,930 --> 04:52:26,650
The one down.

11953
04:52:27,530 --> 04:52:28,490
Left team down.

11954
04:52:28,690 --> 04:52:28,790
Okay.

11955
04:52:29,230 --> 04:52:31,990
They keep destroying my drone, but it keeps getting...

11956
04:52:33,290 --> 04:52:34,190
I'm getting across.

11957
04:52:34,330 --> 04:52:35,530
I'm getting across on the left...

11958
04:52:35,530 --> 04:52:36,150
The right team.

11959
04:52:36,670 --> 04:52:37,070
Okay.

11960
04:52:37,170 --> 04:52:38,150
They might push up to us.

11961
04:52:38,710 --> 04:52:39,630
So I'm gonna be sure.

11962
04:52:39,910 --> 04:52:39,930
Hey, hey.

11963
04:52:39,930 --> 04:52:40,890

11964
04:52:41,010 --> 04:52:41,890

Right here.

11987
04:52:57,230 --> 04:52:57,730
Right here.

11988
04:52:59,070 --> 04:52:59,550
Right here.

11989
04:53:12,970 --> 04:53:13,610
Right here.

11990
04:53:13,610 --> 04:53:13,970
Let's go back.

11991
04:53:14,050 --> 04:53:15,090
Actually, let's get zone.

11992
04:53:15,090 --> 04:53:15,830
We're not even in zone.

11993
04:53:15,990 --> 04:53:16,990
You guys are not even in zone.

11994
04:53:17,350 --> 04:53:18,230
No, I'm going up.

11995
04:53:18,530 --> 04:53:19,110
Go up.

11996
04:53:19,530 --> 04:53:20,270
I'll be bottom.

11997
04:53:22,730 --> 04:53:24,670
Okay, I'll be bottom.

11998
04:53:26,950 --> 04:53:27,470
Right here?

11999
04:53:33,120 --> 04:53:34,360
I think they want to push up.

12000
04:53:35,780 --> 04:53:37,040
Are they fighting each other?

12001
04:53:37,580 --> 04:53:38,440
I'm pushing up.

12002
04:53:39,820 --> 04:53:40,620
Cosney is cracked.

12003
04:53:41,620 --> 04:53:42,220
I'll crack.

12004
04:53:42,840 --> 04:53:43,240
Okay.

12005
04:53:44,040 --> 04:53:45,060
Cosney is cracked too.

12006
04:53:47,260 --> 04:53:48,140
I knocked one.

12007
04:53:49,800 --> 04:53:50,740
I got one.

12008
04:53:53,920 --> 04:53:54,700
I got one.

12009
04:53:55,140 --> 04:53:55,620
Okay.

12010
04:53:58,960 --> 04:53:59,840
I'm going to Doki.

12011
04:54:00,200 --> 04:54:00,820
Okay, here.

12012
04:54:01,020 --> 04:54:01,340
On me.

12013
04:54:02,660 --> 04:54:03,940
Oh my god.

12014
04:54:04,160 --> 04:54:04,860
This is dumb.

12015
04:54:08,900 --> 04:54:09,580
One hit.

12016
04:54:11,980 --> 04:54:13,060
In the cart.

12017
04:54:13,980 --> 04:54:15,340
Okay, be careful.

12018
04:54:17,180 --> 04:54:18,140
Last guy.

12019
04:54:18,200 --> 04:54:18,640
They're inside.

12020
04:54:20,780 --> 04:54:20,940
Nice.

12021
04:54:21,540 --> 04:54:22,200
Last one.

12022
04:54:22,900 --> 04:54:23,500
Solo.

12023
04:54:23,760 --> 04:54:24,180
Solo.

12024
04:54:25,400 --> 04:54:26,560
Oh my god.

12025
04:54:27,040 --> 04:54:28,080
I can.

12026
04:54:31,520 --> 04:54:32,160
Oh my god.

12027
04:54:32,340 --> 04:54:33,140
Got him.

12028
04:54:33,740 --> 04:54:34,340
Nice.

12029
04:54:34,740 --> 04:54:36,760
I'm just like, fuck off.

12030
04:54:36,820 --> 04:54:38,100
Get out of there.

12031
04:54:38,840 --> 04:54:39,440
Yeah.

12032
04:54:39,640 --> 04:54:41,080
He's just sitting inside.

12033
04:54:42,100 --> 04:54:44,580
He's just like he's staying in there.

12034
04:54:46,880 --> 04:54:47,800
Oh my god.

12035
04:54:47,820 --> 04:54:48,340
We did it.

12036
04:54:48,340 --> 04:54:49,640
That has to be Plat.

12037
04:54:49,880 --> 04:54:51,380
That has to be Plat.

12038
04:54:51,580 --> 04:54:51,960
That's a champion.

12039
04:54:55,220 --> 04:54:55,720
Nice.

12040
04:54:58,440 --> 04:54:58,940
Nice.

12041
04:55:00,140 --> 04:55:01,420
We got champion.

12042
04:55:01,640 --> 04:55:02,340
Let's see.

12043
04:55:02,380 --> 04:55:03,380
I'm returning the lobby.

12044
04:55:03,740 --> 04:55:05,600
Yeah, I'm returning the lobby too.

12045
04:55:06,960 --> 04:55:08,660
It definitely is, right?

12046
04:55:09,160 --> 04:55:09,660
Surely.

12047
04:55:10,320 --> 04:55:12,120
I got gold 1 from that.

12048
04:55:12,180 --> 04:55:13,620
I got 330 points from that.

12049
04:55:13,880 --> 04:55:14,540
I'm gold.

12050
04:55:14,540 --> 04:55:15,780
Oh, you got it!

12051
04:55:15,780 --> 04:55:16,220
We got Plat!

12052
04:55:16,280 --> 04:55:16,980
We did it!

12053
04:55:17,520 --> 04:55:19,600
We accomplished our goal!

12054
04:55:20,360 --> 04:55:21,460
Both the goals!

12055
04:55:22,200 --> 04:55:22,800
600.

12056
04:55:25,160 --> 04:55:26,060
Oh my god.

12057
04:55:26,060 --> 04:55:28,720
Oh yeah, because when you rank up to another tier, you get half.

12058
04:55:28,740 --> 04:55:30,540
I got 764.

12059
04:55:31,040 --> 04:55:33,560
I got 330, guys.

12060
04:55:33,880 --> 04:55:37,540
You almost got Plat.

12061
04:55:38,240 --> 04:55:38,840
Guys!

12062
04:55:39,660 --> 04:55:40,260
GG.

12063
04:55:40,260 --> 04:55:41,060
That was fun.

12064
04:55:41,340 --> 04:55:43,380
We are so good.

12065
04:55:44,540 --> 04:55:45,240
We are so good.

12066
04:55:45,240 --> 04:55:46,420
Our teamwork is so good.

12067
04:55:46,680 --> 04:55:46,900
I know!

12068
04:55:47,180 --> 04:55:48,620
We are fucking gamers!

12069
04:55:51,540 --> 04:55:54,280
We are so good, guys.

12070
04:55:54,700 --> 04:55:55,740
Look at us.

12071
04:55:55,900 --> 04:55:57,040
We climbed so much.

12072
04:55:57,420 --> 04:56:00,100
We got like wins against other Master Players.

12073
04:56:02,580 --> 04:56:03,340
We are so good.

12074
04:56:03,400 --> 04:56:03,620
GG.

12075
04:56:03,760 --> 04:56:04,780
I had a lot of fun.

12076
04:56:04,860 --> 04:56:05,440
Yeah, me too.

12077
04:56:05,440 --> 04:56:08,800
We played for 5 hours.

12078
04:56:09,020 --> 04:56:09,700
Oh my god!

12079
04:56:10,940 --> 04:56:12,360
We played so long.

12080
04:56:12,420 --> 04:56:13,740
We were so long.

12081
04:56:14,540 --> 04:56:15,500
Oh my gosh.

12082
04:56:15,540 --> 04:56:16,780
I had a lot of fun, though.

12083
04:56:16,900 --> 04:56:17,920
I had so much fun.

12084
04:56:18,300 --> 04:56:19,440
We should do this again.

12085
04:56:19,720 --> 04:56:20,680
We should definitely grind again.

12086
04:56:21,200 --> 04:56:21,660
Yeah.

12087
04:56:21,820 --> 04:56:22,280
Alright.

12088
04:56:23,180 --> 04:56:24,000
GG, guys.

12089
04:56:24,460 --> 04:56:25,780
I'm gonna head off.

12090
04:56:25,820 --> 04:56:27,100
It was so good to play, guys.

12091
04:56:27,920 --> 04:56:28,720
Bye bye!

12092
04:56:28,920 --> 04:56:30,000
I'm gonna talk to my dragons.

12093
04:56:30,560 --> 04:56:30,980
Bye bye!

12094
04:56:31,920 --> 04:56:32,380
Bye!

12095
04:56:33,260 --> 04:56:33,920
Bye, Ditto!

12096
04:56:36,040 --> 04:56:36,960
Go eat!

12097
04:56:39,240 --> 04:56:40,160
Bye bye!

12098
04:56:40,380 --> 04:56:40,460
Bye bye!

12099
04:56:41,400 --> 04:56:41,860
Oh!

12100
04:56:43,740 --> 04:56:44,520
That was so good.

12101
04:56:44,540 --> 04:56:44,720
That was so fun.

12102
04:56:44,940 --> 04:56:47,140
I had a great time playing with Hiro and Ditto.

12103
04:56:47,380 --> 04:56:48,280
We grinded.

12104
04:56:48,280 --> 04:56:50,100
We won so many games.

12105
04:56:50,420 --> 04:56:51,400
Oh my god.

12106
04:56:51,500 --> 04:56:53,100
We won so many games together.

12107
04:56:53,620 --> 04:56:56,100
And like our teamwork was so good.

12108
04:56:56,940 --> 04:56:59,200
I'm gonna go back to Yiha land.

12109
04:57:02,320 --> 04:57:05,460
I had an incredible time today.

12110
04:57:06,460 --> 04:57:12,120
Tomorrow is Once Human launch with Tenjin tomorrow.

12111
04:57:12,860 --> 04:57:13,500
Um...

12112
04:57:14,540 --> 04:57:18,940
I was not expecting to stream for five hours, but it was really fun though.

12113
04:57:19,080 --> 04:57:20,300
Like we won so many games.

12114
04:57:20,480 --> 04:57:22,820
We fragged the fuck out today.

12115
04:57:22,920 --> 04:57:30,260
My aim when I got warmed up, my aim was like killing it until like I forgot how to control the devotion recoil.

12116
04:57:30,520 --> 04:57:31,600
But other than that...

12117
04:57:35,160 --> 04:57:38,840
Other than that, I had a great time.

12118
04:57:39,540 --> 04:57:39,920
Um...

12119
04:57:40,540 --> 04:57:41,300
Wait, let's see.

12120
04:57:41,360 --> 04:57:42,260
Wait, I need to double check.

12121
04:57:42,460 --> 04:57:43,820
Is the YouTube figure still...

12122
04:57:44,520 --> 04:57:45,180
orderable?

12123
04:57:45,440 --> 04:57:46,100
Guys!

12124
04:57:47,040 --> 04:57:48,900
In ten hours guys!

12125
04:57:49,160 --> 04:57:51,440
Okay, before I leave, I need a shill.

12126
04:57:53,520 --> 04:57:55,640
Complete the Triforce.

12127
04:57:59,520 --> 04:58:05,680
Guys, all I'm saying is like you need this for the figure Triforce.

12128
04:58:05,820 --> 04:58:11,740
Look, your shrine is gonna look real silly if it's incomplete.

12129
04:58:11,940 --> 04:58:12,480
I'm not...

12130
04:58:15,640 --> 04:58:16,660
You need...

12131
04:58:16,660 --> 04:58:22,240
If we're completing the Triforce, we need like the U2s, the Nendoroid, and the Funko Pop.

12132
04:58:22,360 --> 04:58:24,520
I will not stop until I get a Funko Pop.

12133
04:58:24,720 --> 04:58:28,540
But, it's gonna look really silly if you don't have the U2s figure.

12134
04:58:29,420 --> 04:58:30,700
Start it up.

12135
04:58:36,510 --> 04:58:37,030
Um...

12136
04:58:37,030 --> 04:58:41,270
But yes, the U2 figures has ten hours left before it's gone forever!

12137
04:58:42,150 --> 04:58:42,670
Uh...

12138
04:58:42,670 --> 04:58:46,390
So feel free to pre-order it before it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.

12139
04:58:50,430 --> 04:58:50,830
Um...

12140
04:58:50,830 --> 04:58:51,150
Um...

12141
04:58:51,150 --> 04:58:52,270
Is the Funko Pop confirmed?

12142
04:58:52,570 --> 04:58:57,470
No, but I will not stop until I get that Funko Pop so I can complete the Triforce, guys.

12143
04:58:57,810 --> 04:59:00,430
It's like, okay, you know like, um...

12144
04:59:00,790 --> 04:59:01,430
What was it?

12145
04:59:01,470 --> 04:59:07,010
What's that word called when people have like an Oscar, a BAFTA, a Tony... Oh my gosh, what is it called?

12146
04:59:08,030 --> 04:59:08,430
Um...

12147
04:59:09,170 --> 04:59:15,050
When you have an Oscar, BAFTA, Tony, uh...

12148
04:59:15,050 --> 04:59:15,570
EGOT!

12149
04:59:15,810 --> 04:59:16,210
Yes!

12150
04:59:16,970 --> 04:59:17,790
This is our EGOT!

12151
04:59:19,810 --> 04:59:26,990
So you know how celebrities who get, win like the EGOT, which is basically like an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony award?

12152
04:59:27,310 --> 04:59:29,150
This is gonna be my EGOT.

12153
04:59:29,350 --> 04:59:34,770
So like, I'm gonna get like, it's called the Triforce because it means you get a figure for like, um...

12154
04:59:34,770 --> 04:59:37,010
for like every well-known figure play.

12155
04:59:37,130 --> 04:59:39,270
So like Funko Pop, U2s, and Nendoroid.

12156
04:59:39,370 --> 04:59:45,490
So we have like, so we gotta make sure, like, uh, yeah the Funko Pop will appear once you purchase the other two.

12157
04:59:45,650 --> 04:59:48,630
Yeah, the Holy Trinity .

12158
04:59:51,910 --> 04:59:52,310
.

12159
04:59:52,310 --> 04:59:56,470
So guys, we have to complete the collection.

12160
04:59:57,130 --> 04:59:58,350
Anyway guys, that was so fun!

12161
04:59:58,470 --> 05:00:01,810
I had a great time, uh, with Hiro and Ditto.

12162
05:00:02,150 --> 05:00:04,950
Um, we were really, really good together, all of us.

12163
05:00:05,130 --> 05:00:10,550
We were fragging the fuck out, uh, and um, I had an incredible time with them.

12164
05:00:10,750 --> 05:00:11,630
I'm gonna head off now.

12165
05:00:11,730 --> 05:00:12,410
I'm really tired.

12166
05:00:12,870 --> 05:00:14,710
We streamed five hours of Apex.

12167
05:00:15,030 --> 05:00:16,370
Um, so I'm gonna call it here.

12168
05:00:16,970 --> 05:00:18,410
My throat, it needs to rest now.

12169
05:00:18,750 --> 05:00:21,630
But, uh, thank you all for the, uh, gifted membership.

12170
05:00:21,790 --> 05:00:23,090
Thank you for the 20 gift-a-ships!

12171
05:00:23,090 --> 05:00:23,690
Thank you, thank you!

12172
05:00:23,710 --> 05:00:24,830
Thank you for all the Akkas.

12173
05:00:24,910 --> 05:00:26,250
Thank you all for the gift-a-ships.

12174
05:00:26,250 --> 05:00:27,350
Thank you all for the memberships.

12175
05:00:27,970 --> 05:00:28,290
Um...

12176
05:00:29,110 --> 05:00:29,750
Minecraft update.

12177
05:00:29,870 --> 05:00:32,930
I'm sorry if you guys haven't got whitelisted yet, uh, regarding the Minecraft server.

12178
05:00:33,030 --> 05:00:35,050
We're very slowly, like, getting through the whitelist.

12179
05:00:35,150 --> 05:00:41,790
Cause like, we're, uh, implementing a new chat system, uh, for the, for it in, uh, within a few days.

12180
05:00:41,990 --> 05:00:49,070
So within a few days we're gonna have a new chat system where you can chat within your factions, you can chat within a group, and you can chat global chat.

12181
05:00:49,270 --> 05:00:53,730
So there's like three diff- like, I'm not sure yet how many chats there's gonna be, but I asked them.

12182
05:00:53,910 --> 05:00:54,310
And!

12183
05:00:54,550 --> 05:00:59,050
Um, in the future, uh, we're gonna have a server made regarding the Minecraft server.

12184
05:00:59,350 --> 05:01:04,590
Um, and we're planning on hiring a full-on moderation team that handles just the server.

12185
05:01:04,810 --> 05:01:07,350
Uh, because it got a lot bigger than I expected it to be.

12186
05:01:07,430 --> 05:01:09,090
A lot of people are joining the Minecraft server.

12187
05:01:09,970 --> 05:01:10,370
Um...

12188
05:01:10,990 --> 05:01:12,950
And it's getting a lot bigger than I expected it.

12189
05:01:13,030 --> 05:01:14,310
So we're gonna have regular updates.

12190
05:01:14,410 --> 05:01:22,510
And, um, we're gonna have uh, donations to the server so that it goes straight to the Minecraft development team.

12191
05:01:22,710 --> 05:01:30,650
Um, so like, uh, cause we were talking about it because uh, you know, I use your superchats, your memberships to fund the Minecraft server.

12192
05:01:30,930 --> 05:01:34,790
But I figured it would be uh, why are you so- why MindTalk?

12193
05:01:34,890 --> 05:01:35,970
What do you mean, Ditto?

12194
05:01:36,070 --> 05:01:37,750
I am so nice.

12195
05:01:38,110 --> 05:01:39,810
I was so nice.

12196
05:01:42,350 --> 05:01:44,290
I'm not toxic, Ditto.

12197
05:01:44,330 --> 05:01:44,390
I'm not toxic, Ditto.

12198
05:01:44,410 --> 05:01:45,470
I don't know what you're talking about.

12199
05:01:45,610 --> 05:01:47,270
I was not toxic at all.

12200
05:01:47,530 --> 05:01:59,930
Anyway, anyway, um, so like, we're talking about like funding it because um, I put down payment for uh, for like a couple of uh, we're already using- we're almost used up all the payment regarding like server updates.

12201
05:02:00,210 --> 05:02:01,850
So we're talking about like future funding.

12202
05:02:02,090 --> 05:02:08,770
And like, I already used your guys like when your money goes towards like uh, future investments in the channel.

12203
05:02:08,950 --> 05:02:18,210
So I pitched an idea that like uh, for those who wanna fund the Minecraft server, we're gonna have a specific donation link that just goes straight to the Minecraft server.

12204
05:02:18,470 --> 05:02:24,150
Cause I was like- cause we were like, oh we're- at first they were like, well there's too many steps to it because they're gonna donate to you anyway.

12205
05:02:24,350 --> 05:02:25,630
So you- and you just pay us.

12206
05:02:25,790 --> 05:02:29,470
And then I was like, yeah, but they really wanna donate to the Minecraft server and they donate to me.

12207
05:02:29,650 --> 05:02:31,110
YouTube takes 30% of that.

12208
05:02:31,290 --> 05:02:47,450
So I might as well like, if they wanna go directly to the server itself and it goes towards the team, um, and it goes towards the team, towards the Minecraft server specifically, um, I told them to make a, uh, fund just for that.

12209
05:02:47,570 --> 05:02:53,790
And when we reach that fund, uh, and when we reach that fund, uh, you guys won't need to donate anymore.

12210
05:02:53,930 --> 05:02:55,250
And then it goes straight into development.

12211
05:02:55,410 --> 05:02:58,150
Like, uh, so they just grab the money from that fund.

12212
05:02:58,350 --> 05:03:05,330
The team- the Minecraft team will just grab the money from that fund and, uh, and just use that to improve more and more on the server.

12213
05:03:05,570 --> 05:03:07,470
And like more and more updates and everything.

12214
05:03:07,990 --> 05:03:25,310
Um, so, cause I was already funding the server, but I thought like, since like you guys are fun- like sending donations and super chats, uh, to me, and I put it towards the server, it just makes it more easier to just like have it directly to them instead of just YouTube taking 30% of the cut.

12215
05:03:25,510 --> 05:03:45,290
Um, but I already put a- I already put like a- I already put in my own money regarding like future improvements to the server, but after that, um, after that like we're planning on having a donation goal- not donation goal, but like just if you wanna provide more- if you wanna like fund for future updates on the server.

12216
05:03:45,470 --> 05:03:50,050
And when we hit that certain goal, we like cap it so that people don't like over-donate, you know?

12217
05:03:50,150 --> 05:03:53,710
And then the team just like grabs the funds to create more stuff.

12218
05:03:54,030 --> 05:03:57,530
And, um, and that's what we're doing for the server.

12219
05:03:57,790 --> 05:04:04,810
Uh, so yeah, I didn't realize how- how, like, like how much work I guess?

12220
05:04:05,010 --> 05:04:06,550
How much it was gonna grow into?

12221
05:04:06,950 --> 05:04:12,730
Cause like, I didn't realize there's so many people that was like so- like it was like- it was getting more- bigger.

12222
05:04:12,990 --> 05:04:15,030
It's actually turning into a real SMP.

12223
05:04:15,310 --> 05:04:18,650
So like I- I was not expecting that.

12224
05:04:18,830 --> 05:04:27,150
Like- I was not expecting it to like actually turn into like a real ass SMP thing.

12225
05:04:27,450 --> 05:04:27,990
So-

12226
05:04:32,310 --> 05:04:38,090
So we're- it's- it's like getting- growing more- it's like- it's growing more and more every day.

12227
05:04:40,390 --> 05:04:40,690
Um...

12228
05:04:41,990 --> 05:04:42,590
Um...

12229
05:04:43,150 --> 05:04:46,210
But yes, I really apologize uh, if you're not whitelisted yet.

12230
05:04:46,610 --> 05:04:51,010
We're handling it slowly because there's like a lot of other stuff we're dealing with at the moment.

12231
05:04:51,170 --> 05:04:57,090
So, um, and we're gonna try and- we're planning on streamlining the whitelist a little bit more in the future.

12232
05:04:57,670 --> 05:04:58,110
Uh...

12233
05:04:58,110 --> 05:04:59,750
Regarding the server stuff.

12234
05:05:00,010 --> 05:05:00,830
Uh, Discord server.

12235
05:05:01,150 --> 05:05:02,490
Also, thank you for the super chat!

12236
05:05:02,550 --> 05:05:02,750
Thank you!

12237
05:05:02,810 --> 05:05:03,270
Thank you!

12238
05:05:03,390 --> 05:05:05,710
My husband enjoys your Minecraft game and even- No!

12239
05:05:06,210 --> 05:05:06,870
I'm sorry!

12240
05:05:07,570 --> 05:05:09,790
That means you gotta join Minecraft 2.

12241
05:05:09,850 --> 05:05:12,390
You have to play Minecraft 2 so you can go on Minecraft Day.

12242
05:05:12,590 --> 05:05:13,530
It's on my server.

12243
05:05:14,570 --> 05:05:14,970
Alright.

12244
05:05:15,850 --> 05:05:17,350
I'm gonna head off now, everybody.

12245
05:05:18,870 --> 05:05:26,490
As always, everyone, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing and if you stay up for me, head to bed, cause you deserve it!

12246
05:05:26,590 --> 05:05:27,470

12247
05:05:27,890 --> 05:05:28,570

Mmm... Bye!
