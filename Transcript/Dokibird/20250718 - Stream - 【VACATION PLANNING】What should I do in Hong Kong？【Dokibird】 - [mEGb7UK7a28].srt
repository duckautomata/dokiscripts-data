1
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,640
Hey, everybody!

2
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,760
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,740
Today we're doing some vacation planning today.

4
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,340
But yes, I am planning on taking a vacation this year.

5
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,380
I don't know when.

6
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,520
But one of the places I've always talked about how much I really want to go back to.

7
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,660
And always saying how, like, oh, if I do a take-up vacation, it would be back to Hong Kong.

8
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,800
Because it's been, I think, almost 10 years since I've been back there.

9
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,420
And why are we whispering?

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,440
Because it's 9 p.m.

11
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,080
and I'm tired.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm tired.

13
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm tired.

14
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,440
It's like a mini Goodnight Dragoons right now.

15
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,580
So it'll be wintertime in Hong Kong.

16
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,440
Yeah, but, like, I'd rather be back there during the winter than during the summer.

17
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,300
I might not have been there for a while.

18
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,860
But I know how humid it is back there.

19
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,800
Yeah, no.

20
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,200
Yeah, no.

21
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,200
It's really bad.

22
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,420
It's usually, like, in mosquitoes, too.

23
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:22,440
I've been living in Canada for so long that I can almost forget how bad the mosquito problem was back there.

24
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Back then.

25
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,960
And I'm pretty sure it's still pretty bad.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,340
Just because, like, it's just, like, peak mosquito environment.

27
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,320
Because it's humid and it's really hot.

28
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,600
Uh, so, uh, because, like, for those who don't know, uh, they always...

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,260
I don't know if they still play this trailer.

30
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,380
Not trailer, sorry.

31
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,060
Play this ad.

32
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,640
Ha, ha, ha.

33
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,260
Like, I call ads a trailer.

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,440
But I don't know if they still play this ad on TV.

35
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,920
But there's a very, uh, oh, and it's surrounded by water, too.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,740
And there's a very common Hong Kong ad, um, that plays, like, every, every, like, 10 to 15 minutes.

37
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:14,900
I think, I think, every ad break there is, this PSA, about making sure you empty the water around you in your home.

38
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,920
Or the mosquito will use it as a breeding ground.

39
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,840
Or to make sure to, uh, when it's raining, uh, to go home immediately.

40
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,040
And, like, clear all the water around you.

41
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,840
Uh, from your, like, pots and all, like, from your pots and bowls everywhere around you.

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,900
It, and it, it, this PSA was made during, like, the 1980s, I think.

43
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:47,020
Because, like, my mom used to tell me that, like, she used to watch this PSA, like, uh, when she was a teenager.

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,040
So, like, even further back in the 80s, I'm pretty sure.

45
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,400
Like, as a teenager or young adult, she would be like, um, always, like, I've seen this PSA for years.

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,420
And they, I don't know if they still use it, uh, because when I was there, they were still using it.

47
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,200
But, um, yeah, dengue fever is no joke.

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,920
So, uh, uh, I don't know if they remade it or anything.

49
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,900
But I know, like, malaria and dengue, yeah, malaria and dengue fever is, like, like, it's not a joke.

50
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:28,780
So, like, it's a way, uh, uh, to, like, uh, uh, make sure you, like, re-remember to, like, empty all of that stuff.

51
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,840
Yeah, um, it's really dengue.

52
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:43,600
Yeah, that's why I, that's why, like, I personally, I, I, I've also, like, my blood, my blood is, like, really, really attractive to mosquitoes, too.

53
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:51,200
Uh, so, uh, so, like, I remember back then, I would, uh, I would have to wear these, like, mosquito bands.

54
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,040
Like, the, the one that smelled, I don't even know what it's made of.

55
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,900
But my mom would make me wear these, like, mosquito bracelets, where it's, like, a very strong smell.

56
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,660
And I have to spray, like, mosquito repellent every fucking day that I go out.

57
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,000
And, um, and, like, uh, but I still, still get bit.

58
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,300
I still get bit by mosquitoes.

59
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,000
So, I'm not going back during the summer, too, because of that.

60
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,260
Uh, because it's been a very long, like, there's, I don't have, we don't have, really have mosquitoes in Canada.

61
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,940
Um, well, where I live, we don't really have mosquitoes here.

62
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,940
Uh, so, it's been a very, very long time, uh, since, uh, since I've been back.

63
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,560
And I, I, I, I know I scratch myself, too, when I get mosquito bites, because I cannot help it.

64
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,740
I have no self-control.

65
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:49,540
Every time I get bit by a mosquito, I would scratch myself, till, like, I have these little, like, scab wounds on, on my arms, or legs.

66
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,240
And then my mom would still, will rub on those, like, what are they called?

67
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,760
Those ointments and stuff.

68
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,580
The one where it's, like, okay, I'm gonna draw it, because I don't know what it looks, what it's called.

69
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,700
It's, like, this really common ointment, um, that people would rub on.

70
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:17,620
Yeah, and it stings, like, she doesn't, she didn't care that, like, uh, she didn't care that, like, I have an open fucking wound.

71
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,180
She would still rub this ointment on me.

72
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,520
And, um, and I, I don't want it.

73
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,320
I, like, I can't go back, guys.

74
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,720
I can't go back.

75
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know, I just know it's, it's, there's a red cap on it.

76
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
And this is what it looks like.

77
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,860
I'm gonna save it.

78
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,200
Let's see it.

79
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,480
I can't go back, guys.

80
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,260
Not again.

81
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,900
I am, I have no self-control.

82
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,860
I can't go back.

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,940
This is what it looks like.

84
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,340
I don't remember what it's called, though.

85
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,880
But it looks like this.

86
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,460
The, it's not a tire bomb.

87
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,220
It's something like this.

88
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,160
Um.

89
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,980
Um.

90
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,400
That you rub on your mosquito bite.

91
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,960
And, uh.

92
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,080
Someone will know what this is.

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
It's the rub one.

94
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,040
It was, like, that one.

95
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,580
It's very strong.

96
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,400
Like, when they, when you rub it on you, you feel it instantly.

97
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,420
And, uh.

98
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,480
And, I can't go back.

99
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,460
I can't.

100
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,600
Because I know I have no self-control.

101
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,620
I have no self-control.

102
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,100
And I know.

103
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,680
I know I will, I will scratch it.

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,060
I know.

105
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,760
But it's, like, um.

106
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
It's a stick.

107
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,980
I don't know what it's called.

108
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,120
But, and it's, like, a little stick thing.

109
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,140
And then, um.

110
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,120
It's, like, a little bent or whatever.

111
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,980
And then, uh.

112
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Uh.

113
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,000
And then, yeah.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,320
Yeah, my, my mom would, like, rub this fucker on me.

115
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,360
Um.

116
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,880
Anyway.

117
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,700
Uh.

118
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,180
What was I gonna say?

119
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:13,980
But, yes.

120
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll be going.

121
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,800
Or maybe.

122
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,660
I was gonna think.

123
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,440
I found out that there's gonna be a.

124
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,740
Uh.

125
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,780
There's gonna be a Hatsune Miku concert in Hong Kong, too.

126
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,420
But then I know I'm not gonna be able to fucking get the tickets.

127
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,140
And that's the only thing.

128
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,620
And I was, like.

129
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,260
I was thinking.

130
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,600
I was, like.

131
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,560
Oh, man.

132
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,480
Like, I was, like.

133
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,060
Oh, my God.

134
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,900
There's a Hatsune.

135
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,660
But I know.

136
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,340
I know I won't be able to get the fucking tickets to get there.

137
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,600
I'll have to buy a scalper's ticket to get it.

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,120
And it's gonna be, like.

139
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,880
Um.

140
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,320
Yeah.

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
They're doing, like, a world.

142
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,880
They're doing a world tour.

143
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,520
Tour.

144
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,340
Or something.

145
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:48,860
And.

146
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Yeah.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,360
Um.

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,960
I feel like it's already...

149
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,840
I have to buy, like, scalp tickets or some shit to even have a chance.

150
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,820
No, Toki.

151
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't enable Yimium.

152
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,940
There's no other way!

153
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,820
How else am I gonna get the tickets?

154
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,780
Guys!

155
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,620
How else?

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,580
There's no other way!

157
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,480
I don't know.

158
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,320
I maybe have to go to Mong Kok.

159
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
And someone will scalp the ticket.

160
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,640
Most likely.

161
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,700
I don't know if they'll still...

162
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,880
If they still do that.

163
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,460
But I remember, like.

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,580
When I went to...

165
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,260
I went...

166
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,900
I actually...

167
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,720
My very first concert was, uh...

168
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Girls' Generation.

169
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,160
I went...

170
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,320
No.

171
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,060
Not Girls' Generation.

172
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,460
It's Wonder Girls.

173
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,380
My first ever concert...

174
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,420
Was actually in Hong Kong.

175
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,860
For Wonder Girls.

176
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,880
And it's...

177
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
I want nobody, nobody but you.

178
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,600
I want nobody, nobody but you.

179
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,700
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,660
Yeah, that was, like, the OG.

181
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,020
Um...

182
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,720
But that was, like, my very first concert I've ever been to.

183
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,900
But anyway, I was speaking of that.

184
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,900
Because, like...

185
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
I wonder if you can just show up.

186
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,560
And then, like...

187
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,860
You know those people that...

188
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,400
Because I remember when I went to that concert...

189
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,960
There were people selling tickets at the entrance.

190
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,860
Be like, tickets!

191
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,740
Tickets!

192
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Ha-ha-ha...

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,780
Ha-ha-ha...

194
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,800
Who wants to get in for tickets?

195
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,580
Ha-ha-ha-ha...

196
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:23,600
Ha-ha-ha...

197
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
Ha-ha...

198
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,380
Um...

199
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,160
So I don't know.

200
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,500
Maybe...

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,620
Maybe I can sneak my way in.

202
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,460
Um...

203
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,720
But I don't know.

204
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,120
I don't know when I'll be back.

205
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,980
But I want to go around this year, but I don't know exactly when I want to be there.

206
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,040
But yeah, I think the best time to go is during around the wintertime because it doesn't snow.

207
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
It doesn't snow, so I don't have to worry about it.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,100
And when it's cold in Hong Kong...

209
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,260
When it's cold in Hong Kong, it's not that cold.

210
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,600
At least it's not Canadian cold weather.

211
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,380
Like, that's all that matters to me.

212
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,540
I'm just like, at least it's not Canadian cold.

213
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,480
So I'm fine with that.

214
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm fine with that.

215
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,960
I don't have to deal with the humidity.

216
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,900
And it's not Canadian cold.

217
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,320
And there's no... I don't have to deal with snow too.

218
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,620
And I love the decorations that they do too.

219
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,080
The decorations are really pretty.

220
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,260
Um...

221
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,960
Uh...

222
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,260
Yeah.

223
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,560
It could be worse.

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,880
Yeah.

225
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,040
Um...

226
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,180
Yeah, I don't know.

227
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,400
I don't exactly...

228
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,880
Also, like, people are wondering...

229
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,940
I am planning on like...

230
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,420
I won't say like, vlogging.

231
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Maybe vlogging.

232
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,880
And like, taking pictures and stuff.

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,720
And what my plans are when I do come...

234
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:51,980
Go...

235
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,620
Is that I'm gonna record some stuff.

236
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,580
And I'm gonna send it to like...

237
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,240
A...

238
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,100
Maybe like...

239
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,480
Cause I was thinking about 2D at first.

240
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,320
Doing a 2D.

241
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,960
But like...

242
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,600
I think it's easier if I send like...

243
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,260
A 3D...

244
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,000
To a 3D animator.

245
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,500
And just like...

246
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,300
Animate myself.

247
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,860
Like...

248
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,520
Exploring Hong Kong and stuff.

249
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,320
Like...

250
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,680
Uh...

251
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,000
And stuff.

252
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,860
And then like...

253
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,640
Have that like...

254
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
Being posted while I'm gone too.

255
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,020
Can I...

256
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,820
And send some footage.

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,620
Send some like...

258
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,800
Footages and stuff.

259
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,640
Over to a 3D animator.

260
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,400
To make some cute little scenes.

261
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,500
I don't know if I'll be like...

262
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,360
Shorts or something.

263
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,280
Or...

264
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,080
It will be like...

265
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,360
Shorts or like...

266
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,080
Video format.

267
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,680
But that's what I'm planning on doing.

268
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,500
While I'm like...

269
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:28,680
Gone.

270
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,760
So at least you guys get some...

271
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,680
Some sort of content.

272
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:31,880
And like...

273
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
It won't just be like...

274
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,420
Um...

275
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:35,760
Um...

276
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,660
You know, I won't just be like...

277
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,140
Missing, missing.

278
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,760
Cause I don't know if I'll be able to stream.

279
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,680
I don't know.

280
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:39,960
Depending.

281
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,020
Cause I'll most likely be...

282
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,200
At...

283
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,720
You know.

284
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,820
I don't know.

285
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,220
I don't know if I'll do that.

286
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,460
Cause I wanna...

287
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,420
I won't be...

288
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,260
I don't wanna do a BNB.

289
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,820
I don't wanna do a BNB.

290
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,600
I'm too scared.

291
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,040
I hear too many horror stories.

292
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,060
Of people who rent BNBs.

293
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,540
Now.

294
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,720
Because like...

295
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,200
A lot...

296
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,720
There's just too many rules.

297
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,000
When it comes to...

298
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,760
Like...

299
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,200
I feel like it got...

300
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,140
A lot trickier.

301
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,760
And stuff.

302
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,440
Renting like BNBs.

303
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,460
Because there's so many rules now.

304
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,480
About it.

305
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,360
And like...

306
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,620
Like...

307
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,240
And then like...

308
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,980
If you don't clean it.

309
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,680
You'll be charged like...

310
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,320
Uh...

311
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,140
You'll be charged like cleaning fees.

312
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,740
And stuff.

313
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,960
And...

314
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,740
Um...

315
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,320
And...

316
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,500
Yeah.

317
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,140
So...

318
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm too scared to do BNBs.

319
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:22,940
So...

320
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,280
I've never done one before.

321
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,280
I've never done one before.

322
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,480
But I've heard too many stories about like...

323
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,220
Uh...

324
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,400
BNBs and stuff.

325
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:31,820
Like...

326
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,520
Around the world.

327
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,560
So like...

328
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,040
Uh...

329
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,760
I don't know.

330
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm like...

331
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
Most likely...

332
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,980
I'm not gonna rent...

333
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,960
Not gonna do a hotel.

334
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,700
But I'm gonna do like the...

335
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,720
What's it called?

336
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Apartment hotels.

337
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,220
I don't know if you guys ever heard about apartment hotels.

338
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:57,860
But I rented one of those in Japan, and I know they do have some of them in Hong Kong, but it's basically like... I don't know if it's... I think it's like a lot cheaper.

339
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,680
But it's a lot cheaper, but you just have to take care of the... Yes, service apartments!

340
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,100
Yes!

341
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,580
Yes, service apartments!

342
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,860
They're a lot cheaper than hotels if you're renting for a long stay.

343
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:22,140
And you can cook there, and it gives a lot of space and everything.

344
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,420
And I believe there's a washing machine too.

345
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,580
But yeah, I'm thinking of trying to do that.

346
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
I also want to go to Hong Kong Disneyland to see the new Frozen World.

347
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,180
I heard it's the... What was it?

348
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,860
It's the... 20th anniversary?

349
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,600
I can't believe it's the 20th anniversary.

350
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,640
Oh my gosh!

351
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,800
I was watching a video earlier of, like, the 20th anniversary for Hong Kong Disneyland and the stuff they have.

352
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,380
But I'll show you guys the video.

353
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,020
Whoops.

354
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll show you the video.

355
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:07,980
This is a YouTuber I like to watch that gives me, like... That gives me, like, I guess amusement park updates and stuff.

356
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,200
Let's see.

357
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,660
Todd, okay.

358
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,240
Let's see.

359
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll... Okay, so... Alright.

360
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,640
Let me see.

361
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,780
I'll show you the videos.

362
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,640
React time.

363
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,540
Oh baby!

364
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,980
It's time to react!

365
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,800
Okay.

366
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,980
Let's see.

367
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,200
Alright, this is a YouTuber I watch.

368
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,780
His name is TDR Explorer.

369
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,540
I like to watch his stuff when he talks about, like, amusement parks.

370
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,460
You can definitely feel the energy in here.

371
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,020
Yay!

372
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,220
My soul is enjoying this.

373
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,420
Oh my god.

374
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,020
What is this?

375
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,740
Yay!

376
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,040
No, we're not.

377
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,000
We're not gonna watch the whole hour, guys.

378
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,460
This is, like, merch and stuff.

379
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:02,820
Yay!

380
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,380
Merch!

381
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,020
Okay, most likely I won't buy any.

382
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,740
I don't know.

383
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,180
Also, this is so popular.

384
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,780
Like, this character.

385
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,540
I don't... This is... Okay.

386
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,320
Wait, I need to show this... This character.

387
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,680
I don't know what they're called.

388
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:21,800
Um...

389
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,100
But they're very popular in Asia.

390
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,980
Like, in... I know, like, in Japan, these guys are really popular.

391
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,480
They're very popular too.

392
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,040
But they are not... No, they're... They're... No, they're like... It's like the... They're like...

393
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,460
This, like, this bear?

394
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,620
Is it Doofy?

395
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,400
Is it... Duffy or something?

396
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,160
I don't...

397
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,320
I don't... I don't... Yeah, Duffy and Friends!

398
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,820
Yes!

399
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,500
Yes!

400
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,640
Duffy and Friends!

401
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,780
They're incredibly popular, but only in Asia.

402
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,760
Because, like... I don't... I don't know why.

403
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,900
They're not... They're not, like, famous at all outside of Asia.

404
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,580
Like, people in NA have no idea what they are.

405
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,320
But these guys are so popular.

406
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,380
Unless you're, like, a Disney adult or some shit.

407
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,200
But... Unless you're a Disney adult.

408
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,280
Because I've seen, like, pin collectors, uh...

409
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,900
Really liking Duffy and Friends.

410
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,460
That, you know, my favorite...

411
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,720
My favorite pin collecting channel that I like to watch.

412
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,600
Because, like, I live vicariously through them.

413
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,460
Like, I don't understand their hobby, but it's... They're... They have really nice enthusiasm.

414
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,420
Um... But... Uh...

415
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,400
Duffy and Friends are, like, incredibly popular in Asia.

416
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,780
And, um...

417
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,220
And, uh... I don't know why they never, like, made it out of Asia.

418
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,120
I guess because they're just...

419
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,720
It's just... Like, I... For me?

420
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,740
I'm gonna say it.

421
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,820
It might be a hot take.

422
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
It might be a hot take.

423
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,900
But I find them very generic.

424
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,600
I...

425
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,360
I'm sorry.

426
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm sorry.

427
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,180
I... I just find them very generic, in my opinion.

428
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,980
But I... I'm sorry.

429
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,040
But I know they're very famous and popular in Asia.

430
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,860
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,720
I'm...

432
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,560
Cookies and chocolate crunch.

433
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,120
All right.

434
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,500
Yay!

435
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,260
I got this land!

436
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,210
I got...

437
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:23,590
Okay.

438
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,410
Now for the actual real content.

439
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,750
This is what I want.

440
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,550
This is... This is what I want.

441
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,810
This... Look at this.

442
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,110
I want this.

443
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,210
This is what I'm here for.

444
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,750
Oh my god!

445
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,230
Yo.

446
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,370
Of course.

447
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,090
Here's my Disney-themed food!

448
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,550
What the fuck is that?

449
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,230
Look!

450
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:52,930
Oh my god!

451
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,990
That's a tea set!

452
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,850
Oh my god!

453
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,670
That's so cute!

454
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,710
Oh my god!

455
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,150
Look at this tea set!

456
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,290
That's actually so cute!

457
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,350
Look at all that food!

458
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,030
Okay, but you gotta admit, that actually looks really, really good for a tea set.

459
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,790
I'm gonna order this just for...

460
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,990
I'm gonna go there by myself.

461
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,510
And I'm like, I want the tea set for two.

462
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,750
And they're like, oh, is anyone gonna show up?

463
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,390
I was like, no.

464
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,870
I said, a tea set for two.

465
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,540
Oh, there's a buffet, too.

466
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,620
Did I stutter?

467
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,880
It's for me and myself.

468
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,180
I am the two!

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,600
Oh my god, that's...

470
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,880
I don't know what that is, but I'm getting sugar over, though, just looking at it.

471
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Uh, don't make me...

472
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,780
Don't make me repeat myself!

473
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,360
Are these jello shots?

474
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,300
Like, what the fu- Jello shots for kids!

475
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,320
Holy shit!

476
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,680
Okay, that looks bougie as hell, though.

477
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,080
Aww, it's like...

478
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,180
It's like a little pastry.

479
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,380
What is that pineapple?

480
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,760
Is that beef wellington?

481
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,800
Okay, that...

482
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm sorry, but that looks disgusting.

483
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,320
I'm...

484
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,300
What is that?

485
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,600
What...

486
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,300
Is that a fucking...

487
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,420
A ball of pasta?

488
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,420
Wait, what is that?

489
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,900
Okay...

490
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,880
Okay, this is cute.

491
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,300
The...

492
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,540
The mongol bodine.

493
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,680
I love the...

494
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,780
Mango...

495
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,200
Is that a ramen ball?

496
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,860
What the fu- is that?

497
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,080
But this looks cute, because that's a mongol bodine.

498
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,220
I like that.

499
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,500
That's shaped as a...

500
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,780
Shaped like a Winnie the Pooh!

501
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,530
So much for us.

502
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,950
Okay, I'm sorry.

503
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:55,490
We're...

504
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,070
We're definitely...

505
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,250
We're...

506
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,070
This is what...

507
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,910
This is what I'm looking forward to.

508
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,090
This is exactly what...

509
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,130
This is where I'm spending 80% of my time in Disneyland.

510
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,950
Because, like, there's no wait time in Hong Kong.

511
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,550
I'm sorry.

512
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:11,930
There's...

513
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,310
For those who don't know...

514
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,730
Hong Kong...

515
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,590
There's no wait time in Hong Kong Disneyland.

516
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,870
I don't know...

517
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,070
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

518
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,390
There's no wait time there.

519
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,390
So...

520
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,350
So...

521
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,230
We're gonna be able to go to any of the rides so fast.

522
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,650
Yeah, it's so cute.

523
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,690
Oh!

524
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,270
Oh my god.

525
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,370
Look at that.

526
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,150
Is that full fucking chicken just for me?

527
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,190
Oh!

528
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,330
That's a...

529
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,490
Oh my...

530
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:51,590
Bro!

531
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,490
Oh my god!

532
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,330
That Thai chicken is just for me, I guess.

533
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,010
Food in favor.

534
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,390
Whole ass chicken!

535
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,850
And ribs!

536
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Yeah, family...

537
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't know if you heard...

538
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,380
Well, I don't know if the video's loud enough.

539
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,320
He said there's a lot of family feast meals.

540
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,100
And I'm like, yeah!

541
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm the family!

542
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,360
A solid snake!

543
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,960
Thank you for the super chat!

544
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,380
Thank you!

545
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,860
Thank you!

546
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:27,720
Food fun!

547
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,520
All the merch sales going to Doki's and food amusement fest!

548
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,980
Oh yeah, there's Zootopia stuff.

549
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,960
Zootopia is, like, incredibly popular in Asia.

550
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,080
I don't know if you guys know that.

551
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,560
Always because it's, like, furry related.

552
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,160
And, like, um, and we just like cute animals.

553
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,060
I swear, like, cute mascots and stuff.

554
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:56,260
I swear, like, uh, like, it's like how, like, Stitch is, like, incredibly popular in Asia in general.

555
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,500
But yeah, Zootopia is, like, very, very popular in Asia in general.

556
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,800
I think it's just, like, related to, like, mascots and stuff.

557
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,720
Like, we just love mascots in general.

558
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,000
That is a really cute cupcake.

559
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,900
Okay, I...

560
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,140
This apparently is $688.

561
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:25,980
Look.

562
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,840
I don't know that's...

563
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,780
That has to be in Hong Kong dollars.

564
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,840
There's no way.

565
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,740
There's no way this is, like, 688 US dollars.

566
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,240
This has to be, like, HKD.

567
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,060
I don't know how much that is in USD, but this should be, like, 688 HKD.

568
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,420
And, like, the thing is...

569
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,920
I know Disney that...

570
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,500
Because, like, some of you guys are, like, uh...

571
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,240
Some of you guys might be, like, oh, but amusement park food is, like, not that great and overpriced.

572
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,220
No, no, that, like...

573
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,080
Asia...

574
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,720
Asia amusement park food is, like, so much better.

575
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,560
Like, it's actually, like, better.

576
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,020
Like, it's a whole different level compared to, like, NA amusement park food.

577
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,480
Because someone did, like, a comparison between the two...

578
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,580
Like, the two Nintendo World...

579
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,040
Nintendo World, like, Toastal Cafe and stuff.

580
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,900
Um, it's still overpriced.

581
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,760
No, 100%.

582
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,800
It's still overpriced.

583
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,900
But at least it doesn't taste like cardboard.

584
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,580
You know?

585
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,140
And...

586
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,900
At least it doesn't taste like cardboard.

587
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,820
But it's, um...

588
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,300
It's still pretty good.

589
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,280
Oh, my God.

590
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
That's crazy.

591
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,480
I want to order this and be, like, no strawberry.

592
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Okay, that...

593
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
That's a tea set right there.

594
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,780
Oh, my...

595
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,400
Okay, that tea set is so cute.

596
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,100
Because it looks like it came from a cartoon.

597
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,180
Oh, my God.

598
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,340
Oh, my God.

599
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:03,780
That's true.

600
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,120
Ate the family.

601
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,440
Therefore, she is the family.

602
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,200
Yeah.

603
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,500
Thank you for the super chat.

604
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,040
Thank you.

605
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,900
Thank you.

606
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,460
Oh, my God.

607
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,820
Look at this tea set.

608
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,660
That's so cute.

609
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,140
The burger looks like it came out of a cartoon.

610
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:20,620
Yeah.

611
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,540
It even has, like, the little burgers.

612
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,700
It looks like they came out of the cartoon.

613
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,760
Hosted by Coca-Cola.

614
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,320
It's sponsored by Coca-Cola.

615
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah, it's like a little Ferris wheel.

616
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:33,820
Yeah.

617
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,060
Aw, these little mini ones.

618
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,740
I'm sorry.

619
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,260
Duffy is so generic to me.

620
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,640
I'm sorry.

621
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,480
All the Duffy fans.

622
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,300
Please don't...

623
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,000
Please, guys.

624
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,180
Please don't hate-raid my channel.

625
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,640
I'm sorry, Duffy fans.

626
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,080
No, he's just looking through, like, the options and stuff of, like, what kind of food there is.

627
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,680
But, like...

628
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,660
There's, like...

629
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,160
Please don't castle me.

630
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,500
Oh, and I saw, like...

631
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,940
I think this is by Sawaski.

632
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,420
This looks like...

633
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,900
I don't know if you guys know this, but Sawaski is incredibly popular in Hong Kong.

634
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,980
I'm pretty sure the crystals are from Sawaski.

635
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,860
You see Sawaski scores?

636
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,660
I don't...

637
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:19,820
I don't know.

638
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,780
Sawaski is everywhere.

639
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,830
Show us the rides.

640
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,350
Um...

641
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,070
I think it's Sawaski.

642
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,050
It looks like Sawaski...

643
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,010
Sawaski crystals.

644
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,410
But they're, like, everywhere.

645
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:37,530
Okay.

646
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,110
Let's see.

647
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:40,950
I hope...

648
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,390
Okay.

649
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,110
I hope the...

650
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,610
They're not...

651
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,230
He's not too loud and it's not too quiet.

652
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,530
The rides?

653
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,490
Uh...

654
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,490
I don't even know if he's good on any of the rides.

655
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,250
Oh, my God.

656
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,410
Look at all this merch.

657
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,830
Oh, my God.

658
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,510
There's so much merch.

659
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,550
Look at all this.

660
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:57,990
What is this?

661
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,070
What is he opening?

662
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,270
Oh, my God.

663
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:02,990
Blind boxes.

664
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,910
I will buy it.

665
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,770
Blind boxes.

666
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,490
What the fuck is he opening?

667
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,010
Oh, my God.

668
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,230
They're trash cans.

669
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,150
It's a gotcha Tissy land bins.

670
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,290
It's, like, actual gotcha trash.

671
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,170
Oh, my God.

672
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,330
I, like, realized they're, like, it's a fucking trash cans.

673
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:48,110
Like, out of any Disney stuff you get, you want to gotcha the fucking trash can.

674
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:54,070
Like, I, like, garbage pool heaven.

675
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,130
My 24 karat gold, gold trash can.

676
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,950
It's a little trash gotcha.

677
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,990
My favorite Disney blind box.

678
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,850
The double mystic.

679
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,470
Oh, my God.

680
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,750
I want to see him eat this.

681
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,270
Oh, my God.

682
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,710
I, how do you eat this, though?

683
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,410
How the fuck?

684
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,370
That's crazy.

685
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,930
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

686
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,390
All right.

687
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,470
Yeah!

688
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,730
It's, like, I'm there.

689
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,110
Get the feet off the sand.

690
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:41,650
No, I'm sorry.

691
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,210
They think they go to the school or something.

692
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,010
When did he eat this?

693
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,630
Holy shit, he ate so much.

694
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,110
Okay.

695
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,630
Back to...

696
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,430
Yeah.

697
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,550
Oh, ho!

698
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,290
Yeah!

699
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,210
You don't belong here.

700
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,150
Duffy.

701
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,470
He thinks he goes to the school or something.

702
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,550
Yeah!

703
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,960
All right.

704
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,540
Skiff.

705
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,580
Too much.

706
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,780
Aw!

707
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,780
The outfits are so cute.

708
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,380
Okay.

709
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,480
Oh, my God.

710
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,220
This is just all Duffy meet and greets.

711
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,060
And then there's the castle.

712
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,690
Is he still eating?

713
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,710
Oh, my...

714
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,360
Back to food.

715
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,300
Back to the real content.

716
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,520
He's...

717
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,740
It's time.

718
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,900
He went back for it in seconds.

719
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,280
Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

720
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:09,840
That's good.

721
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,900
I need to know about this.

722
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,280
Oh, wait.

723
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,200
Is this...

724
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,420
Oh!

725
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,440
Wait.

726
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,560
That's so cute.

727
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:16,860
Wait.

728
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,620
What is this?

729
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh!

730
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,460
They're pork buns.

731
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,580
That's cute.

732
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,120
Wait.

733
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,380
That's really cute.

734
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,360
I want that.

735
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,000
I didn't...

736
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,880
This is, like, apparently a buffet or some shit.

737
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,340
Yeah.

738
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,060
It's a...

739
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,760
It's a buffet.

740
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,640
I think it's nice.

741
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,760
It's nice that they do this.

742
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,700
I think that's really, really cute.

743
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,700
We don't want to see.

744
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,180
I'm sorry.

745
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,580
Okay.

746
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,960
For those who want to actually see it.

747
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,120
I'll show you guys an actual ride from Hong Kong Disneyland.

748
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,120
Um.

749
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,700
Um.

750
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,480
I'll show you the...

751
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:50,820
Okay.

752
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,080
This one's really famous.

753
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,940
Mystic Manor Hong Kong Disneyland.

754
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,620
I've been to Mystic Manor before.

755
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,460
Um.

756
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,800
Like I said, like...

757
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,920
There's no actual, like...

758
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,600
Lines for Hong Kong...

759
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,020
I don't know if it's different.

760
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,200
Is it different now?

761
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,280
Because, like, back then...

762
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,900
Back then, there was, like, barely any lines.

763
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,560
You can literally just go through instantly.

764
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,420
But maybe it's different now.

765
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,280
Because it is the 20th anniversary.

766
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,820
So maybe it's different now.

767
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,900
But usually, like...

768
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,560
Usually, it's very easy to, like, finish Hong Kong Disneyland in, like, a couple of hours.

769
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,180
Alright.

770
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,020
I'll show you guys.

771
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,620
This is, like...

772
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:30,880
What?

773
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,900
This is, um...

774
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,640
This is, like...

775
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,460
Uh...

776
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,300
Cues aren't bad.

777
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,860
Yeah, it's good.

778
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,580
Cues aren't bad.

779
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,740
You may wait maybe a bit during peak times.

780
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,380
I wonder what...

781
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,460
What's peak time?

782
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't...

783
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,260
I went there, like...

784
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,120
Three times.

785
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
But, um...

786
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,920
I went there three times and...

787
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,860
Um...

788
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,880
And...

789
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,260
Um...

790
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,000
Never had to wait too long for it.

791
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,040
Alright.

792
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,060
I'll show you.

793
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,580
I'll show you...

794
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,220
I'll show you Mystic Manor.

795
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,920
So, this is basically, like...

796
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,820
Their version...

797
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,560
Instead of the Haunted Manor...

798
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,720
The Haunted Manor...

799
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,560
We have the Mystic Manor.

800
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,360
Um...

801
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,760
And, uh...

802
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,420
Oh, make sure it doesn't line up with a school trip.

803
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:14,760
Oh!

804
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,600
If it's, like...

805
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,540
Yeah, if I go during the winter, it'll be fine.

806
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,140
Because, like, every...

807
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,700
All the kids will have to go to school.

808
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,680
Um...

809
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,060
Oh, let me know about the sound.

810
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,640
Oh!

811
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,200
But, one thing I really want to go is Ocean Park.

812
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,460
Okay, we all skip here.

813
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,440
Is the sound okay?

814
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,380
Or is it too loud?

815
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,020
Let me know.

816
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,360
So, like...

817
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,260
Basically...

818
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,360
You're in some old man's house.

819
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,680
And...

820
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:48,920
Yeah.

821
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,540
I like Ocean Park more.

822
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,640
Ocean Park is really, really fun.

823
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,960
You get...

824
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah.

825
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,180
I'm pretty sure I'll get demonetized.

826
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,860
But, that's okay.

827
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,960
I want to see the pandas!

828
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,260
I haven't seen the pandas in so long!

829
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,360
Apparently, they got a third...

830
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,480
Wait.

831
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,160
How long do pandas live for?

832
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,080
Okay, this is fucked up for me to ask.

833
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,460
But, like...

834
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:14,960
Because, like...

835
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
Are they the same pandas?

836
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,380
I hope they're the same pandas.

837
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,080
This is Mystic Mani!

838
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,500
Because I saw them when I was, like, a kid.

839
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,300
So...

840
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,060
Oh, okay, there.

841
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,100
Look.

842
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,640
That's good.

843
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,420
So, it's the same pandas that I saw.

844
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,080
So, you're basically...

845
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,340
So, this monkey's a little shithead.

846
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,640
And he, like...

847
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,740
He basically, like...

848
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,520
Uh...

849
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,160
Opens a magic box and makes everything come alive.

850
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,360
Yeah, there are more...

851
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,600
There are six now?

852
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,920
Did they make babies?

853
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh, my God!

854
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,100
Did they do it?

855
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,400
Wait.

856
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,660
Did they actually make babies?

857
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,840
Or, like...

858
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,480
Were they sent new pandas?

859
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,620
Oh, my God!

860
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,040
When I was there, there was only two!

861
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
They did it!

862
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,220
Congrats on the sex.

863
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,360
Oh, my God!

864
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

865
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,060
This ride actually freaked me out.

866
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,840
Because, like I said, I...

867
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,560
I...

868
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,180
Really hate animatronics in general.

869
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,880
And I wasn't...

870
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,640
I didn't know what I was watching.

871
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,680
Like, I didn't know...

872
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,580
I didn't know exactly...

873
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,760
What I'd be, like...

874
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,240
Um...

875
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
Experiencing when I'm, like...

876
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,940
In this ride.

877
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,140
So...

878
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,940
I was...

879
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,780
I didn't know that they were, like...

880
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,400
All the animatronics are, like...

881
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,860
Up that close to me.

882
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,640
And it freaked me out a lot.

883
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,160
Like, now- this is- like, these are okay, but then, like, the further you go in, the more- the more stuff happens.

884
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,980
And I was, like, not happy about it.

885
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,040
I was not hap- like this, that- that actually scared me.

886
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,340
I remember when that happened, and that fucking scared- This one, too, I was not happy.

887
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:08,800
I-

888
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,880
But- because it got dark, too.

889
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,140
So I was, like, oh, I was not happy.

890
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,480
I- I-

891
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,380
I, like, closed my eyes for, like, half of this ride.

892
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,000
How small was I?

893
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,940
I won't- I won't tell you the age.

894
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,280
I was just saying... that... um...

895
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,060
I was... maybe at... maybe older than ten.

896
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,530
Yeah!

897
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,450
I hated these, too.

898
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,030
Okay, no, this one's here, which- not this one.

899
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:09,530
Um, it was- not- there's, like, not this one, but there was one here that I was not a fan of.

900
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,550
Bum, bum.

901
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,870
I'm speeding it, though.

902
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,190
I'm gonna speed it a little.

903
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,970
I love this channel, by the way.

904
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,910
Attraction 360?

905
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,450
I live vicariously through this channel.

906
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,530
This room.

907
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,510
I didn't like this room.

908
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,750
I did not like this room.

909
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,850
I did not like this room!

910
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,810
This room?

911
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,850
Oh my god.

912
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,210
Because, like, these guys- oh, I- I- I don't like the tiki stuff.

913
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,810
I actually have, like- it- it- it does not look very friendly.

914
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,310
Because, like, there's a reason why.

915
00:37:49,570 --> 00:38:06,030
Um, I told this story before, but when I was li- very little, um, for some fucking reason, my parents owned this li- this, like, little diet box thing, filled with tiny-ass tiki mask.

916
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,010
I don't even know their tiki mask or, like, aboriginal mask.

917
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,050
Um, but, like, uh, I don't remember.

918
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:18,470
And they would put it- hang it on the stairs to the basement.

919
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:23,330
And then whenever I see it at night, it's- I, like, freak out.

920
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,790
Because, like, it, like- it, like, gives me nightmares and stuff.

921
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:31,530
But, I did not like this- this area.

922
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,450
I- I closed my eyes for this.

923
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,430
I closed my eyes for, uh, for this part of the ride.

924
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,910
Because I was not a fan.

925
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,540
But, yeah.

926
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,980
I will say, this was cool, though.

927
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,780
This was really cool.

928
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,040
I like that.

929
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,680
Because it, like, it's like, you know, Wukon and, uh, Wukon statue.

930
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,160
Why are they- because he's a fucking asshole!

931
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,260
He did this!

932
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,220
Yeah, this is Mystic Manor.

933
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,520
That is a very short- I mean, it's, uh...

934
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,060
It's, like, a five minute ride.

935
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,200
It's pretty decent, I think.

936
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,480
I think it's pretty decent.

937
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,200
And everything, uh, and then everything, uh, went okay.

938
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:30,820
Yay!

939
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,180
Oh my- I'm sorry.

940
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,840
I know, like, we were supposed to be vacation planning.

941
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,240
But, like, that, like, reminded me about something.

942
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,060
But, I have to show you guys.

943
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,520
I know we were supposed to be vacation planning.

944
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
But, I was gonna look up Ocean Park stuff.

945
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,440
But, I- Okay, Sing...

946
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,780
Universal Studios.

947
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,480
You know there's a Universal Studios in Beijing now?

948
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,420
I did not realize they opened the Universal Studios in Beijing.

949
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,240
There's a Disneyland in Shanghai.

950
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,460
Which I love- I would love to go as well.

951
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,640
Um, which is great because my, uh, my 3D studio, um, is actually located in Shanghai.

952
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,920
So, like, it's a good excuse for me, you know, when I do my 3D debut.

953
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,920
It's a good excuse for me to, you know, go to Shanghai Disneyland.

954
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,320
Um, but, like...

955
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:25,800
Okay.

956
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,820
I'm definitely gonna get demonetized here, but...

957
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,920
But, it's actually really cool.

958
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,280
But, they have a sing show.

959
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,300
Um, in...

960
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,540
They have a sing show at Universal Studios in Beijing.

961
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,560
And I was- Okay, but, like...

962
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,100
Alright, I'll show you, like...

963
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,160
So, like, it's, like, Chinese sing.

964
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,660
Where they introduce everything in Chinese.

965
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,400
And then singing in English.

966
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,220
But, like, it's actually so cool.

967
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,400
It's so fucking cool.

968
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,490
Okay, wait.

969
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,330
Okay, this...

970
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:15,770
Okay.

971
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,090
Oh, you can't see it properly.

972
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,550
Oh, sorry.

973
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,510
Let's do this one.

974
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,030
This is better.

975
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,330
This guy's closer.

976
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,930
This guy's closer.

977
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:25,750
Alright.

978
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,710
This is better.

979
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,430
Alright, here we go.

980
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:33,710
Look at this.

981
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,610
The costumes are great, by the way.

982
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,730
Until, like...

983
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,550
The final one.

984
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,290
Which looks a little freaky.

985
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,010
Yeah, it's an animatronic.

986
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,170
But, the rest are, like, actual costumes.

987
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,330
Yeah, it's- it's Mandarin.

988
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,390
Look at this.

989
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,240
Yeah!

990
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,400
Yeah!

991
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,720
Woo!

992
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,250
Let him go!

993
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,810
That's my boy!

994
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,990
Okay, you can't see it very well here.

995
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,190
Because, like, the thing is covering it.

996
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,710
But...

997
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,410
But, like...

998
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,370
I think he's singing, too.

999
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,270
I'm pretty sure.

1000
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,350
I'm pretty sure.

1001
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,830
I don't think this is a recording.

1002
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,250
It does not sound like a recording recording.

1003
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,530
Yeah!

1004
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,250
I'm still standing.

1005
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,310
In a mudslide.

1006
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,150
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1007
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,710
It doesn't sound like a recording recording.

1008
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,470
Yeah, yeah.

1009
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,890
It's like, one lifts.

1010
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,530
Okay, but look at this.

1011
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,530
I like how, like...

1012
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,170
They're so big.

1013
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,660
Yeah, and then...

1014
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,360
Okay, all right.

1015
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,040
And then there's the elephant here.

1016
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,940
I think that's crazy.

1017
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,120
Like, that it's able to...

1018
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,500
Not crazy, but, like, it's actually so cool.

1019
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,040
To see...

1020
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,920
To see, like...

1021
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,160
The costume moving, too.

1022
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,080
Like, the mouse.

1023
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,640
But I know this is not a recent thing.

1024
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,260
Because, uh...

1025
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,760
Because I know, like...

1026
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,680
The Disney mascots do that, too.

1027
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,880
Where the mouse move.

1028
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,000
And the...

1029
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,720
The eyes can blink, too.

1030
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,180
Okay.

1031
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,180
All right.

1032
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,300
I will show you.

1033
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,040
Like, all these costumes look so good.

1034
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,760
And then we get to the Scarlett Johansson porcupine.

1035
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,410
The scene's great, though.

1036
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,010
I love the scene, though.

1037
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,530
But...

1038
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,430
I just.

1039
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,350
There's just something about...

1040
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,790
I think it's the eyes.

1041
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,370
I think it's the...

1042
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,590
I think.

1043
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,870
I think it's the eyes.

1044
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:51,970
Maybe.

1045
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,770
I...

1046
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:53,150
Yes!

1047
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,090
It's the eyes, right?

1048
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,390
It's the eyes.

1049
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,290
It's more than just the eyes.

1050
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,410
The thing is, everything else looks... I love everything.

1051
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,150
Okay.

1052
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:18,650
Okay, it's like... She's just so out of place.

1053
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,690
She just looks so out of place.

1054
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,950
With everyone else.

1055
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,590
That's really it.

1056
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,380
That's what I was like.

1057
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,400
Everything else looks amazing, though.

1058
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,080
I mean, it looks fun.

1059
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,880
It's just... It's just the eyes.

1060
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,240
I can't... I don't know what it is about it.

1061
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,440
It might emerge.

1062
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,880
One of those things is not like the other.

1063
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,060
Yeah, I like the... I love... Like, he knows what he's doing.

1064
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,620
She does, too!

1065
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,760
It's just... The costume is not... Really helping her right now.

1066
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,900
Yeah, the costume is just not helping her.

1067
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,220
But I wanted to show you guys this.

1068
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,120
I... I didn't know what Universal... Universal is now in Beijing, though.

1069
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,280
Universal Studios.

1070
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,520
That's so cool.

1071
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,800
I want to go there, too.

1072
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,840
Um... Yeah... She's just set up to fail.

1073
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:27,860
Unfortunately.

1074
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,280
Um... But... Oh, that's Ocean Park.

1075
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,860
What is... What is new at Ocean Park?

1076
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:33,960
Anyway.

1077
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,880
Uh... Okay.

1078
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,580
Water World.

1079
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,640
We're not going there.

1080
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,720
My God.

1081
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,260
I don't want to do any of the roller coasters.

1082
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,960
I'm really bad with roller coasters.

1083
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,120
Um... Ocean Park Attraction Guide.

1084
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,880
Alright.

1085
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,920
Let's see.

1086
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,960
Yay!

1087
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,060
Ocean Park!

1088
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,420
Yay!

1089
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,280
No!

1090
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,760
I hate the... I don't like roller coasters.

1091
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,760
No!

1092
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,380
Penguins!

1093
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,680
Disneyland opened in 2005, but instead...

1094
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,100
Okay.

1095
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,040
The main gift shop, as well as lots of attractions.

1096
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,480
I know that...

1097
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,060
This is very unique.

1098
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,400
Okay.

1099
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:15,980
Let's see.

1100
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,580
Whiskers Harbor.

1101
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,900
Amazing Asian Animals.

1102
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,280
Polar Adventure.

1103
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,020
Thrill...

1104
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,020
I know, like...

1105
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,680
I got really tired walking around this, though.

1106
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,280
Because I was...

1107
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,600
I was there during the summer.

1108
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,200
It was so fucking hot.

1109
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,560
I don't like roller coasters.

1110
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,160
I'm like...

1111
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,900
I don't like...

1112
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,760
I have fear of heights.

1113
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,200
Um...

1114
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,300
Oh, it's so cute.

1115
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:39,740
Aquarium!

1116
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,860
Ocean Park sucks now?

1117
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,000
Oh!

1118
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,560
It was so pretty back then.

1119
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,100
It was so fun back then.

1120
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,860
Oh, Halloween events are always really fun.

1121
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,040
I don't...

1122
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,280
I don't want to go on...

1123
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,840
I just don't want to go on the roller coasters.

1124
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,320
Because I'm not a fan of roller coasters.

1125
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,420
Oh, panda, panda, panda.

1126
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,340
Oh, my God!

1127
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,560
I should go to the monkey...

1128
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,240
Monkey Mountain!

1129
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,620
Okay, sorry.

1130
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,500
I don't have ADHD.

1131
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,600
I don't know...

1132
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
I've never been to Monkey Mountain.

1133
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,360
But there's a mountain in Hong Kong...

1134
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,480
That's just filled with monkeys.

1135
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,140
And you're not supposed to, like...

1136
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,960
Feed them anything.

1137
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,660
Or they'll fucking steal your stuff.

1138
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,040
Oh, it's an animal's crucial conservation effort...

1139
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,580
That can help save this particular species.

1140
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,360
Sky, thank you for the rain.

1141
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,540
Thank you, thank you.

1142
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,840
That will take you back to the retro era...

1143
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,340
Oh.

1144
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,720
Oh, that's cute.

1145
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,340
I can enjoy the photo-friendly area...

1146
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,660
Monkey Mountain has monkeys...

1147
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't know what it's actually called.

1148
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,920
I don't know what the...

1149
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,000
Those monkeys...

1150
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,040
I've never been there!

1151
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,380
I've only passed...

1152
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,080
I've only, like, passed...

1153
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,580
Like, passed the mountains...

1154
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,920
And seen the monkeys walking on the road.

1155
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,280
And then my parents would be, like...

1156
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,580
My parents would be...

1157
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,380
I'd be like, I want to go to Monkey Mountain.

1158
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,500
And then my parents would be like, no, you don't.

1159
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,100
I'm like, oh, my God.

1160
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,540
I want to go to Monkey...

1161
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,460
Like, we would pass it by the...

1162
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,160
The taxis.

1163
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,500
Taxis, like, you know, like the red taxis, the red calves.

1164
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,940
We'll be in the red cab and then we'll pass by Monkey Mountain.

1165
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,320
It's like, I want to just go see the Monkey Mountain.

1166
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,520
I want to see the monkeys at Monkey Mountain.

1167
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,180
I heard like, no, you don't.

1168
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,780
You don't.

1169
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
Don't bite you.

1170
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,620
No, you don't, little doki.

1171
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:42,180
I choose from a selection of sea creatures, including seahorses, dolphins, sharks, and goldfish.

1172
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,020
This is a great attraction for all the family.

1173
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,600
to enjoy.

1174
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,340
Next, we have Sloth and Friends Studio.

1175
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:55,280
It's a bit featuring the lovable slow-moons, along with macaws, kinkajus, and pythons.

1176
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,340
And they are right.

1177
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,920
As long as I don't feed them, it'll be fun, right?

1178
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,700
Oh, the cable.

1179
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,860
I don't want to go through the cable car.

1180
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,720
I know like a lot of people, like this is like an iconic attraction, the cable car.

1181
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:28,560
But like, I, I, my fear of heights actually, I, I don't know if I told you guys this story before, but, um, when I was traveling with my parents in Europe, we, we took these like, we have to take a cable car up to like this very giant mountain, um, like this snowy mountain,

1182
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:43,180
and like, if you guys didn't know, like, the higher the altitude is, the harder it is to breathe, and like, apparently my heart was beating too fast, and I couldn't, I was having a lot of trouble breathing and stuff too, um, while we were going up, so then my parents,

1183
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:50,840
like, my dad had to take me back down, because like, the altitude, I, it was the altitude, and like, I was just too, too scared of the heights.

1184
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,660
Um, but like, I'm just really bad with heights in general.

1185
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:04,280
I find, for me, it's just scary, because like, I'm not really good with heights in general.

1186
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:08,740
Okay.

1187
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,960
Show me the pandas!

1188
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,240
I wanna see the pandas!

1189
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,160
Yay!

1190
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,740
Yay!

1191
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,920
I was here!

1192
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,040
Yes!

1193
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,680
I see these, uh, Yingying and Lele!

1194
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,780
Why is there only two?

1195
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,940
Where is this, the four others?

1196
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,920
You can find Yingying and Lele, two amazing giant...

1197
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,580
Where are the four other pandas?

1198
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,300
I was told there were four, six pandas.

1199
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,280
...in their specialized habitat.

1200
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:48,460
You can also see some red pandas, and the largest amphibian in the world, a Chinese giant salamander.

1201
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:48,940
Oh!

1202
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:54,460
Our animal exhibits include Gator Marsh, showcasing rare Asian alligators, and finally...

1203
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,160
The four others are VIP?

1204
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,460
VIP?

1205
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,460
I will become VIP.

1206
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,540
I will become VIP.

1207
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,380
I'll be like, um, do you know who I am?

1208
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,580
I am a VTuber!

1209
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,160
Hahaha!

1210
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:10,100
The two walking trails include the Emerald Trail that features lots of different birds and beautiful...

1211
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,640
That's cute!

1212
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:12,160
...making it...

1213
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,440
...is Toto the Loco, a mini train ride that takes you on a small adventure.

1214
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,680
Where do I ride on this train?

1215
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,120
...is perfect for the younger visitors.

1216
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:18,800
Hahaha!

1217
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:18,900
Hahaha!

1218
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,800
Oh, wait, there's meerkats?!

1219
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,160
...and includes interactive elements...

1220
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,060
I didn't know there were meerkats...

1221
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,280
...that the younger visitors will love.

1222
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:30,760
Next up is Castle of Red, a maze of tunnels, climbing nets, and fun, interactive animals...

1223
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,960
I think this is for children.

1224
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,520
...and lots of people...

1225
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:33,840
...a mini-shirt.

1226
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,480
Hahaha!

1227
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,220
...a mini-shirt!

1228
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,040
Oh my god!

1229
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,300
Yeah, I'm not going on that ride!

1230
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,540
...and the ocean...

1231
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,160
...a great...

1232
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,760
...is the South Pole spectacular.

1233
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:44,680
What's this?

1234
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,840
PENGUINS!

1235
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,360
...penguins...

1236
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,520
...from three different species...

1237
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,380
...including king penguins, rock hopper penguins, and white bonneted gentoo penguins.

1238
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,720
If you love these animals, then I would suggest dining in the nearby restaurant called Tuxedo...

1239
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,420
...that offers a panoramic view of the beautiful birds as you die.

1240
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,500
That's so cute!

1241
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,860
I want to eat natural penguins.

1242
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,820
Now head to the Arctic box.

1243
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,520
Hey, there's arctic boxes now?

1244
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,720
That features the elusive tundra predator.

1245
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,760
The information boards explain the key behaviors of the species along with the impact of humans...

1246
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,760
Oh, that's cute!

1247
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,740
The final attraction in Polar Adventure is the North Pole Encounter.

1248
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,540
This exhibit showcases two huge pacific walruses and spotted seals.

1249
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,500
Visitors are able to view these...

1250
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,040
Oh my god!

1251
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,320
It's the fat seals!

1252
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,940
I love these!

1253
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:40,760
Okay, I love these seals because when they squish up against the glass, it's so silly.

1254
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,180
I love seeing those fat fucks!

1255
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,620
We now head to the next one, Roll Mountain.

1256
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,660
A carnival...

1257
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,700
Oh, it's like a little carn...

1258
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,980
Yeah, it's like a little carnival!

1259
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,880
This one is the Ultramax flat ride called The Flash.

1260
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,680
This will spin you 22 meters into the air.

1261
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,720
This one, I don't mind.

1262
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,480
This one, I don't mind as a ride.

1263
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,040
I know...

1264
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,320
I can just close my eyes and feel the wind.

1265
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:06,940
That's fine.

1266
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,860
Never mind.

1267
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,800
It goes upside down.

1268
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,080
I'm not fine with that.

1269
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:10,660
Never mind.

1270
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,460
I take it back.

1271
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,720
I thought it just goes like right to the left, but it goes upside down.

1272
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,860
I'm not fine with that.

1273
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,340
I'm...

1274
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,360
Never mind.

1275
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,140
That is not fine.

1276
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,880
I'm fine with this.

1277
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,120
I'm fine...

1278
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,200
Yeah, I don't go upside down.

1279
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,740
Okay, these are like...

1280
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,660
This is a classic.

1281
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,020
This is a classic ride.

1282
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,560
I like how all these are just classic...

1283
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,080
I like that they're all just classic rides.

1284
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,600
Oh!

1285
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:51,880
Oh!

1286
00:54:54,100 --> 00:55:01,120
I love this marine world.

1287
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,460
Oh, so this is like part of the aquarium stuff.

1288
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,600
What the fuck?

1289
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:14,100
Okay, I was gonna be like, that's so, like, out of nowhere, you know?

1290
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,480
It's like, oh, look at all these animals.

1291
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,680
And it's like, welcome to the demon grove.

1292
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,440
And I'm like, what?

1293
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,200
Where did this come from?

1294
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,360
Oh, I don't like this.

1295
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,540
I don't like that.

1296
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,280
That is the bad part of the neighborhood.

1297
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:49,360
Like, we were talking about cute animals and, like, and, like, penguins.

1298
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,520
It's like, welcome to demon grove.

1299
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,460
Took a wrong turn.

1300
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,000
Welcome to Japan.

1301
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,220
What is this?

1302
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,180
Wait, what is it?

1303
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,060
Wait, what?

1304
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,260
What the?

1305
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:11,940
Oh!

1306
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,620
Laser tag.

1307
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,120
What the fuck?

1308
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,820
In my ocean?

1309
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,520
Where is the ocean involved?

1310
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,400
Like, the alien egg, wait!

1311
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,440
There was the alien egg.

1312
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,640
Did you guys see that?

1313
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,200
And a massive force of up to 4Gs, this is certainly not...

1314
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:38,460
What?

1315
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,480
What is it called again?

1316
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,160
Wait, I need to see what this is called.

1317
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,320
1,800 lab?

1318
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,960
You either head to the cable car at the top part of the...

1319
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,080
Yeah, Xenomorph!

1320
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,140
Or for a shorter way, you can head further on up to the Ocean Express, located in the rainforest.

1321
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:57,060
Each night, there are two nighttime shows in the Aqua City Lagoon, near the entrance of the park.

1322
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:05,520
First is Visions of Comic-Con, showcasing the city's character, and evoking a spectrum of emotions, with the use of lights and fountains.

1323
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:13,440
And the second show is Soul of the Ocean, that uses a special mix of original music, projection mapping technology...

1324
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,400
That's so cool!

1325
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,780
Oh my god, that is scary!

1326
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:17,800
I...

1327
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,160
That is so scary, I'm sorry.

1328
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,300
That's...

1329
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,740
Oh, is BGM a bit loud?

1330
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,300
Come here...

1331
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,180
Oh, whoops, sorry!

1332
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,320
I forgot I had BGM.

1333
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,120
I'm...

1334
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,280
I'm sorry.

1335
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,500
I didn't even realize I had BGM.

1336
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,740
Okay, so...

1337
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:36,940
I don't know.

1338
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,360
That...

1339
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,020
That last part was pretty scary.

1340
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:39,580
Okay, what's it called?

1341
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,120
1-1800...

1342
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,540
Lab?

1343
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,620
1-800...

1344
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,140
Lab?

1345
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,540
Ocean Park?

1346
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,160
What's it called?

1347
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,140
1-800 Lab?

1348
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,800
180 Lab.

1349
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,840
There's no videos of it?

1350
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,620
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

1351
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,440
What, like...

1352
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,300
What...

1353
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,800
Is it a new rat?

1354
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,120
What is that?

1355
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,600
I wanna know what it is.

1356
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,040
1-800...

1357
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,460
180 Laboratory.

1358
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,520
I just wanna know what's inside it.

1359
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,740
A scary index.

1360
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,280
A hidden lab...

1361
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,600
Okay, near...

1362
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,080
That's...

1363
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,300
There's no info.

1364
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,260
I just wanna know, like...

1365
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,720
What's inside...

1366
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,100
What's inside...

1367
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:31,020
Wait, no one has ever filmed...

1368
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,880
I guess you're not allowed to film the inside?

1369
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,880
There's no way.

1370
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:36,500
What?

1371
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:42,100
You're not allowed to film the inside of 1-800 Laboratory?

1372
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,340
Or 1-80 Laboratory?

1373
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,300
What does it look like?

1374
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,000
Don't open dead inside.

1375
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,000
I just wanna know...

1376
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,560
Oh my god.

1377
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,180
Okay, I'm looking at the pictures...

1378
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,200
And it's like...

1379
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,080
It's pretty freaky.

1380
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:58,820
Not gonna lie.

1381
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,500
Never mind.

1382
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,180
This...

1383
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,060
It's actually like...

1384
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,260
Horror, horror.

1385
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:06,620
It's...

1386
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,100
I looked at the pictures...

1387
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,180
And I'm not a fan.

1388
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,760
I'm sorry.

1389
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,480
Like...

1390
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,920
I'm...

1391
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,880
I'm scared.

1392
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:12,480
I'm...

1393
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:12,920
Like...

1394
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,440
It might look actually...

1395
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,460
It actually looks scary, scary.

1396
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,940
There's a video trailer of it.

1397
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,680
I'll show you guys.

1398
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,580
Let me see.

1399
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,480
Holy shit.

1400
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,940
What is this video trailer?

1401
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:45,270
This is an ad for a fucking ride.

1402
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:49,030
What?

1403
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,810
Bro, what the...

1404
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,110
This is a good-ass fucking ad.

1405
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:57,930
Quality.

1406
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,530
So why is it like this?

1407
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,480
What the fuck?

1408
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,090
Now she's outside?

1409
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:24,770
Okay.

1410
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:26,030
Okay.

1411
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,730
What I don't understand...

1412
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,030
Is that...

1413
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:32,710
When...

1414
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,090
In the video...

1415
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,130
They were like...

1416
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:36,300
Oh...

1417
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:37,330
Oh...

1418
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:37,730
Um...

1419
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,530
You're trying to stop an infection.

1420
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,730
And then I'm like...

1421
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,570
This does not look like an infection.

1422
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,350
This...

1423
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,570
This looks like straight-up horror.

1424
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:52,830
Like...

1425
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:53,590
What the fuck?

1426
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,270
I thought I played laser tag.

1427
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,450
Oh my god.

1428
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,530
Oh look.

1429
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:06,490
Everything's okay.

1430
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:07,570
Every...

1431
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:07,790
Oh.

1432
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,190
Everything is not okay.

1433
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,610
Oh.

1434
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,650
They change theme every year?

1435
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:15,350
Oh.

1436
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,210
Maybe for now it's laser tag.

1437
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,670
This is a very aggressive infection.

1438
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:21,270
Yeah.

1439
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:22,150
Yeah.

1440
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,630
Because I was like...

1441
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:28,730
Wait.

1442
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:29,210
What?

1443
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:32,390
I thought...

1444
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,270
I thought there was something about...

1445
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:34,590
Oh.

1446
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,910
Oh.

1447
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,250
Okay.

1448
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,930
I'm reading this.

1449
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:38,250
Okay.

1450
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,390
It's cause like...

1451
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,890
When this...

1452
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,410
This laboratory came out...

1453
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,550
They basically dedicated...

1454
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,150
Based...

1455
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,770
Dedicated the entire thing...

1456
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,210
Based off of like...

1457
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,830
A haunted school.

1458
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,470
So like...

1459
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:55,650
Yeah.

1460
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:56,850
So...

1461
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:57,650
Um...

1462
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,530
So like this trailer was advertising the haunted...

1463
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,670
Where the fuck does the laboratory come in...

1464
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:03,130
In this school?

1465
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,410
I guess it's a lab...

1466
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,010
Like for science in school?

1467
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,010
But...

1468
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,250
This was like one of the things...

1469
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:09,810
Like what...

1470
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,230
Like the whole theme was...

1471
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,050
Haunted school in Ocean Park.

1472
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,850
Yeah.

1473
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,870
My parents wouldn't let me go to Ocean Park during Halloween...

1474
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,170
Because that's where like...

1475
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,350
That's where the...

1476
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:21,110
Adult scary stuff is.

1477
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:21,890
Like Disney...

1478
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:23,090
Hong Kong Disneyland...

1479
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,350
Was for the kiddie Halloween experience.

1480
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:26,970
And then...

1481
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,250
Uh...

1482
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,890
Ocean Park was for...

1483
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:29,570
The adults.

1484
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:30,910
But that's a lie.

1485
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:31,490
Okay, wait.

1486
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:31,810
No.

1487
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,430
That's...

1488
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:33,390
That's a lie.

1489
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,730
Because one time...

1490
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:36,870
Hong Kong Disneyland went fucking hard.

1491
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,770
Because I saw like a video about it.

1492
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,510
Like Disneyland...

1493
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:43,370
Hong Kong Disneyland haunted house.

1494
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,410
They went really hard...

1495
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,350
In one of their haunted houses.

1496
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,270
It was actually like...

1497
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,090
Pretty crazy.

1498
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,350
It was called like...

1499
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,170
The Maze of Nightmare.

1500
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:55,290
I'll show you guys.

1501
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,110
They did this in Hong Kong Disneyland.

1502
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,270
It was crazy.

1503
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,290
I was like...

1504
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,470
I saw...

1505
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,410
I saw like...

1506
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,670
The trailer for it.

1507
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:07,750
And...

1508
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,750
Um...

1509
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,110
I saw the trailer for it.

1510
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,910
And like...

1511
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:12,710
One of the haunted houses...

1512
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:13,810
Were like...

1513
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:14,890
I was like...

1514
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:16,150
A kid should not...

1515
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:19,050
I don't think a child...

1516
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,030
Would be okay.

1517
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,990
I...

1518
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,780
This was like...

1519
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,980
This was seven years ago.

1520
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,270
But it's called...

1521
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:33,210
Maze of Nightmares...

1522
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,510
At Hong Kong Disneyland.

1523
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,110
You might be like...

1524
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,210
This is not so bad.

1525
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:38,410
But like...

1526
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:40,510
Um...

1527
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,650
Oh, it's not so bad.

1528
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:43,190
Look, there's the Monster Inc.

1529
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,050
people here.

1530
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:44,770
See?

1531
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,910
The children love seeing that.

1532
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:48,990
But then...

1533
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:50,170
Like...

1534
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,810
Like...

1535
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,790
And you're like...

1536
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:58,930
Okay, that's fine.

1537
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,370
It's just a...

1538
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,010
It's just the Mad Hatter.

1539
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,090
That's all right.

1540
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:05,970
But then...

1541
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,030
I saw this.

1542
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,710
And I was like...

1543
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,830
That's not all right.

1544
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,860
I was like...

1545
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,440
That's not all right.

1546
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,500
That's not...

1547
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,860
I saw that.

1548
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:26,640
And then you're like...

1549
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:26,920
Okay.

1550
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,160
And so...

1551
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,740
I saw like...

1552
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,220
Somebody going through...

1553
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,520
That is...

1554
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,320
Much...

1555
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:33,580
Much...

1556
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,240
Less...

1557
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:34,920
All right.

1558
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,160
I feel like...

1559
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,220
If a child saw...

1560
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,100
When a child sees that...

1561
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,040
If he's like...

1562
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,000
Holy fuck.

1563
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,640
I need...

1564
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,060
Oh man.

1565
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:45,900
I need to...

1566
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,820
See where...

1567
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,000
Okay.

1568
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,660
Is it this one?

1569
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,960
I think it's this one.

1570
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,160
Okay.

1571
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,800
Hey, Keef.

1572
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,160
All right.

1573
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:54,620
Okay.

1574
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:55,980
So like...

1575
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,640
Let me...

1576
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,240
Let's watch...

1577
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,020
Let's go through this.

1578
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,460
Yeah.

1579
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,120
But when you're a child...

1580
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,440
Going through this...

1581
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,260
It's like...

1582
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:05,520
Oh wait.

1583
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,580
Dude, what's a higher quality video than this?

1584
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,260
But we'll...

1585
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,700
Let's look at Keef's video.

1586
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,840
I mean...

1587
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,000
This just looks really cool.

1588
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,840
This was a...

1589
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,220
This was a Disneyland...

1590
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,940
Haunted house...

1591
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,320
Maze.

1592
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,270
But like...

1593
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:24,750
I remember there was one...

1594
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,290
Where like...

1595
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,510
I saw someone get...

1596
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:26,970
Like...

1597
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:28,350
You see someone get murdered.

1598
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:28,950
Basically.

1599
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,430
And there's...

1600
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,590
Faciliator.

1601
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:37,090
But for...

1602
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,350
That guy.

1603
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:39,930
Where is it?

1604
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:40,870
It was like...

1605
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,130
It was like...

1606
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:42,710
Pretty creepy.

1607
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:43,570
Oh my god.

1608
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:44,610
It's like...

1609
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:45,190
Pretty creepy.

1610
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,190
But I'm trying to like...

1611
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:47,030
Remember...

1612
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,290
What scene it was.

1613
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:51,670
Jesus.

1614
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:52,170
Jesus...

1615
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:53,050
Ah.

1616
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:53,470
I...

1617
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:54,850
That's not okay.

1618
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,690
That's not okay.

1619
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:02,790
That's...

1620
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,450
That's okay.

1621
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:07,410
That...

1622
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:12,650
Oh yeah, that was not, that's not, that's not.

1623
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,270
Oh here, this one was creepy.

1624
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:18,090
Not this one, but that's creepy.

1625
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,730
But this room, this room.

1626
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:30,430
I saw an HD video of this, and this one was really, I didn't, this one was creepy.

1627
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:36,330
I won't say like, it's scary, but like, this one is creepy.

1628
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:43,610
I find it creepy, because he's like, trapped in a room, of beheaded, animals.

1629
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:56,150
Like, there's Bambi, like, an actual insane Mad Hatter, because you can see Bambi's in there, by the way.

1630
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:09,190
There's, there's, imagine, you're a kid, and you saw Bubba, a beheaded Bambi.

1631
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:26,230
He's like, I think he's mad, and he's like, asking, he's like, asking the kids, do you want it?

1632
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,790
You, listen, say yum, ta.

1633
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,390
Ha ha ha ha.

1634
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:32,210
Uh oh.

1635
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:34,170
Uh oh.

1636
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:38,930
Oh no, oh no, he's gonna, he's approaching the child.

1637
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,910
Oh my god, I told you, the child's running away.

1638
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:49,130
Oh my god, the child, I told you, he preached, the child ran away.

1639
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:52,530
I told you, if I was a child, I'd be so freaked out.

1640
01:07:52,690 --> 01:08:04,550
I, I, I, I, oh my god, it's really, the killer is escaping, and CT containment preach.

1641
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:08,950
Oh my god, he actually wanted to grab the child.

1642
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:30,690
Oh my god, if

1643
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,330
you don't listen, he's gonna cut me.

1644
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:37,830
Oh,

1645
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:45,560
we offer an interactive experience.

1646
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,180
Like, I'm gonna cut your head.

1647
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,120
Bro, that jump scare.

1648
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,880
What's next after that?

1649
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,580
I mean, it's pretty cool.

1650
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,580
It's pretty cool.

1651
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,640
I just thought, like, when I saw that, I was like, I was like, bro, children?

1652
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,400
I, I, it is cool.

1653
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,580
But for kids, children do not think it's cool.

1654
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:17,600
I'm pretty sure.

1655
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm pretty sure the children did not think that was cool.

1656
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,300
Oh yeah, there was this, wait.

1657
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,380
What is this?

1658
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,820
Um, it should not be there.

1659
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,440
Wait, there's more.

1660
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,240
There's more videos I can show you guys.

1661
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:40,280
Uh, cause like, this one was like, Hong Kong, Halloween, Disneyland.

1662
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,160
Halloween and Hong Kong, Disneyland was like, went like, so hardcore.

1663
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:47,920
Is it this?

1664
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,560
Oh yeah, here, you get to be like, up close and personal.

1665
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,080
Like, Pennywise?

1666
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,040
Like, if I saw this, I'm...

1667
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,540
That is not okay.

1668
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,060
Oh my god, he's like, help me, please.

1669
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,380
Help me.

1670
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,540
Run away, Padukio!

1671
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,180
Someone help me!

1672
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:33,410
He's like, are you all happy?

1673
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:44,950
And then Pinocchio's literally...

1674
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,210
Okay, you guys don't understand what they're saying.

1675
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:48,890
Some of you guys might not understand.

1676
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,730
But Pinocchio is literally like, begging for his life right now.

1677
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,890
It's like, he's like,

1678
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,400
he's literally begging for his life.

1679
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,240
I can feel it in my soul.

1680
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,880
The fact that...

1681
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,720
This is like, official Disney, by the way.

1682
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,560
This is not parody or anything.

1683
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,440
Like, this is real...

1684
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,520
A real Disney Pinocchio.

1685
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,520
Oh, another new studio.

1686
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,140
Oh, it's the screamer!

1687
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,540
Trying to suck your...

1688
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,700
Suck your screams.

1689
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,560
What's this?

1690
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,040
Oh, he's gonna kill him!

1691
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:00,390
Oh my god!

1692
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,450
He's begging for his life!

1693
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,930
And you're all just filming it!

1694
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,870
He's begging for his life!

1695
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:15,260
And you're all just filming it!

1696
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:33,320
And you're all just filming it!

1697
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,340
Like, wait!

1698
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,940
I know like, Japan...

1699
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,660
Disneyland Japan during Halloween...

1700
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:38,320
No, it's like...

1701
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:38,380
No!

1702
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,540
Universal Halloween in Japan is pretty hardcore too.

1703
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,560
What I've...

1704
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,700
What I saw.

1705
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,180
I remember seeing like, really hardcore shit in...

1706
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:50,860
Um...

1707
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,460
For it.

1708
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:52,800
But yeah!

1709
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,400
No, I thought it was a...

1710
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,920
When I remember when I first saw like, the...

1711
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,720
Uh...

1712
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,760
Hong Kong Disneyland...

1713
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,440
Haunted house stuff.

1714
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,600
I was like, holy...

1715
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,040
Fuck!

1716
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:03,860
That's scary.

1717
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,440
That's so scary.

1718
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:07,700
Um...

1719
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,280
Alright, sorry.

1720
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,820
Enough amusement park shit.

1721
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,080
That's...

1722
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,180
That's actually...

1723
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:15,640
Is there...

1724
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,820
What else can we do?

1725
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,060
In Hong Kong?

1726
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,140
Other than ocean parking...

1727
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:21,460
I wanna go to Mong Kok.

1728
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,520
That's like, one of my favorite places to go.

1729
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,720
Whenever I'm there.

1730
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,080
For anyone that's never been there.

1731
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:27,740
It's like...

1732
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,820
It's like, basically where you can buy...

1733
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,480
Like...

1734
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:32,880
Um...

1735
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,640
There's like, lots of stuff you can buy.

1736
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,100
There's like, uh...

1737
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:37,880
Lots of food.

1738
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,440
And like, uh...

1739
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,920
Merch.

1740
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,240
And like, cute stuff.

1741
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:41,960
And everything.

1742
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,580
Like, um...

1743
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,680
The official hot...

1744
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,060
Like, a lot of like...

1745
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,400
Official...

1746
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:48,500
Uh...

1747
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,020
Official, uh...

1748
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,260
Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

1749
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,580
Toy Studios are in Mong Kok too.

1750
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,740
Alright, let's look.

1751
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,620
Yeah, oh this brings back memories.

1752
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,540
Like the little bamboo pillars there when you walk down.

1753
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,280
And then the yellow minibuses and the red taxis.

1754
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,660
I'm gonna take a new bus.

1755
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,460
Actually... Taxis are pretty cheap though.

1756
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,740
Like in Hong Kong.

1757
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,000
Or I just take the... Actually I should just take...

1758
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,300
The MTR.

1759
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:20,880
What am I saying?

1760
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:22,380
I should just take the metro.

1761
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,140
I need to buy an octopus card though.

1762
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,300
I don't have an octopus card anymore.

1763
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,040
Buh buh buh buh.

1764
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,020
All that brings back...

1765
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,160
Oh, are they now... Are they now expensive?

1766
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,460
MTR.

1767
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,100
Metro.

1768
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,020
And it is Nathan Road.

1769
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:56,810
Oh yeah!

1770
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:58,770
You can now put it in your apple wallet.

1771
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:00,070
I forgot about that.

1772
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,470
I don't remember what it's called.

1773
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:06,570
There was like Mong Kok.

1774
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,710
There was a place in Mong Kok.

1775
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:10,230
Where it's like...

1776
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,710
Where it's mostly like...

1777
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,630
Anime figures and stuff.

1778
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:19,710
Maybe I'll go there when my Nendoroid comes out.

1779
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:21,170
So I can see and be like...

1780
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:21,690
There's me!

1781
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,670
Oh look, foot palace.

1782
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,230
Oh there's the ladies market.

1783
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,070
This is like very...

1784
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,790
This is a very touristy spot though.

1785
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,590
Right here.

1786
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:39,150
I...

1787
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:42,010
I normally don't go through this area.

1788
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,970
Because tourists love...

1789
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,530
Love going through this area.

1790
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,130
So like there's a lot of overpriced stuff.

1791
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:48,990
Because of it.

1792
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:52,530
I mean it's like a great experience.

1793
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:54,610
It's a great experience though.

1794
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:55,810
If you've never been here.

1795
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:56,770
But like...

1796
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,150
Um...

1797
01:15:59,150 --> 01:15:59,770
But like...

1798
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,210
A lot of tourists love going here.

1799
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:01,890
So a lot of...

1800
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,510
There's like...

1801
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:03,470
A lot of places here.

1802
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:04,010
It's like...

1803
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:04,650
You gotta haggle.

1804
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:04,930
Yeah.

1805
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:07,030
You have to haggle for it.

1806
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:08,990
And there's like...

1807
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:09,810
It's more so for...

1808
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:10,470
It's like a...

1809
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:11,690
More so for tourists though.

1810
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,150
Yeah.

1811
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,200
Alright.

1812
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:20,880
What is it?

1813
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:21,740
Oh there's the...

1814
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:21,960
Haha!

1815
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,180
The night mask!

1816
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,180
Do they go down to that?

1817
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,780
Does anyone know what that place is called?

1818
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:27,740
The one...

1819
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:28,140
The...

1820
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,300
Oh I love...

1821
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:29,860
Oh my god.

1822
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,600
It looks so good.

1823
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:32,520
Oh my god.

1824
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,100
That looks so good though.

1825
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,580
Where are the ladies?

1826
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,760
Does anyone know what that place is called in Mongkok?

1827
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:43,380
The...

1828
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,580
The one where...

1829
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,480
You can buy anime figures and stuff?

1830
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,080
Oh this is the sneaker area.

1831
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,360
This is the sneaker street.

1832
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:54,860
Everything in this street...

1833
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:55,700
I remember this street.

1834
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:56,560
But...

1835
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:57,740
Everything...

1836
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:58,620
Oh is this Sinocente?

1837
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,380
Sinocente?

1838
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:02,480
Everything on this street is just...

1839
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,400
Sport related stuff.

1840
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,700
So like...

1841
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,260
It's all...

1842
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:05,700
It's called...

1843
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:05,960
It's the...

1844
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,740
I don't know what it's called.

1845
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,060
But I call it sneaker street.

1846
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:11,440
It's just shoes.

1847
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,680
It's mostly like running shoes.

1848
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:22,030
I remember this place.

1849
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,430
I love Mongkok though.

1850
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,350
Come buy tea.

1851
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,750
Come buy tea.

1852
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,110
All right.

1853
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,530
And this is...

1854
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:37,750
Ying...

1855
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,490
Ying Chong street.

1856
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:41,650
All right.

1857
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,110
Is this Sinocenter?

1858
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:43,870
Sinocenter?

1859
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,470
Sinocenter Hong Kong.

1860
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,210
Is there a little walking tour of it?

1861
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:50,630
Oh, there it is.

1862
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:51,070
Discover.

1863
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:51,610
Discover.

1864
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:51,670
Here.

1865
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:53,010
Oh, I love this place!

1866
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:54,450
Is it this place?

1867
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:56,330
Oh, by the way.

1868
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,250
This is like a little...

1869
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:59,870
This is the MTR area.

1870
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,950
Always remember to be on the right hand...

1871
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:04,670
Is it right hand side?

1872
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,590
Always remember to be on the right hand side.

1873
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,510
Because...

1874
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:09,570
It's...

1875
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:09,710
Okay.

1876
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,510
I found out in different places, it's different direction.

1877
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:16,970
cause in Hong Kong, we always have to be on the right side.

1878
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:20,810
So, you can see that everyone's always on the right side.

1879
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,010
I know that...

1880
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:23,650
Like people in NA don't know about this rule.

1881
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:24,710
But like...

1882
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,570
When you're on the right side, if you're not in the rush...

1883
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:30,290
And then on the left side, if you're on the rush...

1884
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,770
You can walk up the stuff.

1885
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:36,350
But like...

1886
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:40,150
But like, I found out the different countries it's different.

1887
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,110
But not NA people don't care in NA.

1888
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:52,090
I know, like, I think Japan was left, right?

1889
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:56,770
I think Japan is, like, if you're not in a rush, you go on the left side.

1890
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:57,350
Yeah.

1891
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:00,390
Or something.

1892
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,840
It was, like, in Japan or, like, somewhere else.

1893
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:07,720
I don't remember.

1894
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:14,540
But, like, because I remember I was trying to stand on the right side, and then I realized, oh, wait, everyone's on the left.

1895
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,660
And then I was like, oopsie.

1896
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:16,480
Yeah.

1897
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,240
So this is the MTR, metro station.

1898
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:22,560
It's very clean.

1899
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,560
I like it.

1900
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:31,120
Because I remember when I was first in New York City, I was like, oh, they have a metro subway just like in Hong Kong.

1901
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,060
It was not the best experience.

1902
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:42,500
Because I would think, like, oh, yeah, maybe it's just like the one in Hong Kong.

1903
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,100
Yeah, it was not.

1904
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,740
It just smelled like piss.

1905
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,760
It really just smelled like piss.

1906
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,520
In New York City.

1907
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,220
Oh, you know what I'm really looking forward to?

1908
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:05,400
I think it's the same in Japan, but they, um, in Hong Kong, they always do these little promotion things in 7-Eleven.

1909
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,000
I wonder what the promotions are now.

1910
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:13,420
I think my favorite one was the Sanrio and the Disney one.

1911
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:13,980
I don't know.

1912
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:24,400
People in Hong Kong might remember it, but it's the little metallic, the plastic, little plastic figures at 7-Eleven at that time.

1913
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,640
And it was to celebrate Hong Kong Disneyland.

1914
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:31,420
And everyone was fucking obsessed about it in Hong Kong at 7-Eleven.

1915
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:36,020
I was, I was obsessed with it.

1916
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,020
Wait, this is the metro station.

1917
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,020
And then, take me to Sino Center.

1918
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,180
Sino Center?

1919
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:47,540
I don't remember what it's called.

1920
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,080
Oh, here.

1921
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,460
This is the classic area.

1922
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:58,040
There's a Chikawa promotion right now.

1923
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:59,440
Oh, Chikawa.

1924
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,020
Go in.

1925
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,620
Go in.

1926
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,720
Oh, here it is.

1927
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,260
I love this.

1928
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,300
I used to go to this place all the time.

1929
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:20,220
Basically, there's like, it's just all, it's like, figures.

1930
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,060
I would buy my phone cases here, too.

1931
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:26,680
I would buy, like, they have some really cute phone cases.

1932
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,060
And, um, like, uh, accessories for your phone.

1933
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,020
I loved exploring here.

1934
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,120
Every time I get to go to Hong Kong.

1935
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,440
Oh my god, they have fucking crane machines now?

1936
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,280
Yeah, it's the Tech, Anime, and Computer Center.

1937
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,660
It has it all.

1938
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,760
I didn't buy so many things here.

1939
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,680
There's also, like, Japanese magazines and stuff.

1940
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,340
And cards, too.

1941
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,220
This is where I bought my Italia cards.

1942
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:06,760
And then sold some of them to, like, NA people.

1943
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,760
I would say it's, like, Hong Kong, Akyabara.

1944
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,080
Yeah.

1945
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,920
Oh my god.

1946
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,520
They have, oh, they have these.

1947
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,460
They have, oh my god.

1948
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,440
That, this is new.

1949
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,680
I've never seen this before.

1950
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,140
Hot Toys.

1951
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,320
I love Hot Toys.

1952
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,420
For those who don't, they have, the Hot Toys Studio is actually here.

1953
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:39,580
Um.

1954
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:44,280
The Hot Toys, uh, uh, office is here.

1955
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,180
In Mong Kok.

1956
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,080
I don't know, did they ever move?

1957
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:53,980
Because I used to go to the Hot Toys, um, I used to go to the Hot Toys, uh, office to get their stuff.

1958
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,140
Yeah, it's the secret base.

1959
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,520
I have several figures from them when I used to live in Hong Kong.

1960
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,980
I have the, I have the low-key one.

1961
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:09,380
I have low-key and one of the Iron Man's.

1962
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,940
And then I don't remember what else I have.

1963
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,700
Of course there's Pop Mart in Hong Kong.

1964
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:27,140
Majority of the famous Pop Mart, um, not majority, but a lot of the really popular Pop Mart figures, come from Hong Kong Illustrators.

1965
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,220
The boo-boo was designed by Hong Kong Illustrator.

1966
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,500
It's okay, I don't care.

1967
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,040
I don't care about the boo-boos.

1968
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,720
Well, usually it's all, they usually, okay, you will know when it's a fake store.

1969
01:23:54,020 --> 01:24:01,640
Because the, the real ones, you, because like, majority of the stores here, back then when I was here, were like, legit.

1970
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,300
Were like, legit stores.

1971
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,000
They don't sell, like, bootlegs.

1972
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,300
But you would know if it's a bootleg store.

1973
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:16,580
Yeah!

1974
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,520
Maybe I want to come over here when my Nendoroid comes out.

1975
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,000
Check me like, that's me!

1976
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,640
Also, I used to be really good at spotting bootlegs.

1977
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:33,700
But like, I don't know anymore.

1978
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,280
Oh my god, look at all this Gundam stuff.

1979
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,380
Yeah, and they're really easy.

1980
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,560
I don't know if they got better or not.

1981
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:46,180
So I can't, I can't tell.

1982
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:52,520
And then you could do like, this gacha post.

1983
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:56,320
Do they still have the R18 store here?

1984
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,880
Does anyone, wait, guys.

1985
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:02,880
If you're, if you know, you know.

1986
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:10,220
But I remember, my, my dad accidentally let me go into an R18 store.

1987
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,300
There's only one.

1988
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,720
There's only one in this mall.

1989
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,540
And like, I accidentally went there.

1990
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:19,940
Because, um, because, and I was with my dad.

1991
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,540
And my dad did not know.

1992
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,280
And, wait, many?

1993
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,360
Okay, I just knew that one.

1994
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:31,140
Because I was trying to find a very important figure.

1995
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,720
And, it's like, yeah, it's in the corner.

1996
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,320
And I went in.

1997
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:39,060
And then I, then my dad went in with me.

1998
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,640
And then I saw a naked woman.

1999
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,320
And then my dad like, pulled me out.

2000
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,580
I saw, I saw like those, like a photo card of a naked woman.

2001
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,780
and my dad pulled me out.

2002
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,220
I just know the one.

2003
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,420
I don't know if there's more than one.

2004
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,660
Little did he know.

2005
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,360
He was like, he was like, wait, saw la.

2006
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:20,820
Oh, Shin-chan.

2007
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:21,840
Susan.

2008
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,900
Oh my gosh.

2009
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,300
You're so cute.

2010
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:35,270
I love these.

2011
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,990
I would spend so much time here.

2012
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,810
Just looking through everything.

2013
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:43,950
This is my favorite, favorite thing to do.

2014
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:47,070
Whenever, I would like, beg to go to Mong Kok.

2015
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:50,490
Because it's like, my favorite place to go.

2016
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:56,030
This was literally like, my, I would use my red pocket money for this place.

2017
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:05,190
one time, my dad, one time for my birthday, my dad was like, what do you want for your birthday?

2018
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,390
And I was like, I want to go to Mong Kok.

2019
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:17,190
And then, and then like, my dad would just take me here and then let me be like, okay, your budget is X amount of money.

2020
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:22,070
And then I just like, walked around to spend like, X amount of money around here.

2021
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:28,130
And then I would also spend my red pocket money here too.

2022
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:35,010
Like, after Chinese New Year, I would like, come here, and just spend my money.

2023
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,090
That's why I had, I had so many figures.

2024
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:50,790
Oh, buy three, get one, get one, buy three, get one for three, free.

2025
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:56,110
Oh my God, did you hear that?

2026
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,350
Buy three, get one for free.

2027
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:03,390
Oh, what a deal.

2028
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:08,970
What you call it?

2029
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,450
We're react channel now.

2030
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:17,350
Wait, is that, wait, is that, wait a minute.

2031
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:18,810
Wait, I want that.

2032
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:20,930
This better still be there when I'm there.

2033
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,650
Is that sausage?

2034
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:27,850
Bro, I want, I want a key chain of, oh my God.

2035
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:32,270
Is that a sausage?

2036
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,110
Bro, that's a key chain of a sausage.

2037
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:35,710
I want that.

2038
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:38,350
Always has.

2039
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:40,550
I too.

2040
01:28:40,850 --> 01:28:44,070
Oh my God, this is like, okay, this is actually nostalgia.

2041
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,030
This is, that's when you know, this is serious.

2042
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:48,790
Okay, I love these.

2043
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:53,270
These ones are the actual, legit, serious figure stores.

2044
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:58,530
Where like, they, they're literally here to hold pre-orders.

2045
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,610
This is like a legitimately, legit business.

2046
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:06,890
But I love these ones because, you go there only to pre-order.

2047
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,910
So that's why you see all these paper stuff.

2048
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:15,930
So like, and then you pre-order, yeah, you pre-order here.

2049
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:17,830
You see all these boxes, they're all pre-orders.

2050
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:23,190
So you go here for the latest figure, and then you go to them to pre-order.

2051
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:26,350
Because these are like, cheaper too, because you don't have to pay for shipping at all.

2052
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:28,750
So like, because like, they handle all this shit.

2053
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:34,170
Like, you don't have to pay for shipping and it usually is cheaper than ordering online on the store.

2054
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:37,450
So yeah, this is a serious business.

2055
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:43,610
So every time I want like, a figure I really, really want, I would just like, go to these stores for just pre-order.

2056
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:50,610
Yeah.

2057
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:54,850
Yeah, no sightseeing.

2058
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:56,030
You know what you want.

2059
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,270
You're not here to window shop.

2060
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:03,590
You're here on a mission.

2061
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:12,730
Yeah, and yeah, he has like a, you basically, you go up to him for, for all the pre-order stuff.

2062
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:17,510
You go pre-order and leave, exactly.

2063
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:24,850
You're just not here for sightseeing.

2064
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:29,950
But sightseeing in this best part of shopping.

2065
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,610
Unless you're here for serious business.

2066
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:41,490
Oh my god, look at everything.

2067
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,310
It's so cute.

2068
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:46,150
Jimmy, thank you for the super chat.

2069
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:46,470
Thank you.

2070
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:47,070
Thank you.

2071
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:52,450
Oh, also there's like, I think it's like three floors.

2072
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:53,790
Three or four floors.

2073
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:56,030
I'm not, I don't remember that much.

2074
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,950
It's been so long.

2075
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:01,330
Oh.

2076
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,200
Oh my god, the crane machines are new though.

2077
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,020
I don't remember the crane machines.

2078
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,300
Oh my god, is that Nekopara?

2079
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,780
the zoom in!

2080
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:28,310
That guy fucking zoomed in on that.

2081
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:29,590
That's crazy.

2082
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:31,910
Yes.

2083
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:35,290
That's actually crazy.

2084
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:36,950
Real sly.

2085
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:40,290
He had not done a single zoom in before, by the way.

2086
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:44,770
Yes, I haven't seen this guy do any zoom ins until now.

2087
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,020
Wow.

2088
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:56,420
Let's see.

2089
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:05,960
It's mostly just, I think, I might, oh, I love this, I love, that's, I love this one.

2090
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:11,100
This is one of my favorite, uh, uh, Resident figure, uh, series.

2091
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:20,660
By the way, it's really silly, this one, this tiger one, because like, in his figures, they show his balls.

2092
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:31,880
If you know this toy series, his, his, his feature, is that, his balls are showing.

2093
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:32,520
His,

2094
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,980
you can buy it at Pop Mart.

2095
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:56,820
Why is he, why is he zoom, he's zooming at all, he's zooming at all the ladies.

2096
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:58,420
Oh, hey, there's a minion.

2097
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:03,160
Of course, he zooms in.

2098
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,240
That's funny.

2099
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:10,500
That's really funny, that he zooms in on all the, all the ladies.

2100
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,380
It was on Goak.

2101
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,980
No, no, it was definitely not.

2102
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,880
It was on the, what was it?

2103
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,060
Re, was it, is it called ReZero?

2104
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,500
Or Rem, right?

2105
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,120
Oh my god, there's an actual, oh, there's an actual bookstore.

2106
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,500
It was on Rem.

2107
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:26,900
I saw it.

2108
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,840
I know, I know what I, I know what you are.

2109
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,600
Oh, and then these are all for the cards.

2110
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:35,080
You can get all the cards here.

2111
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,220
It's literally just cards.

2112
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,440
And there's more figures.

2113
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,940
And there's Gundam.

2114
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:56,180
They have like a custom, custom, garage kit one, garage kit store too.

2115
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:11,570
I know they have a garage kit store as well.

2116
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:13,330
When I was there.

2117
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:15,370
I don't know if it's still there though.

2118
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:19,230
Oh, these are the, the mini figures.

2119
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:20,730
The mini blind boxes.

2120
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:26,050
Wait, is that, what's the store to my left?

2121
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,870
Is that where the item is?

2122
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:32,230
Oh yeah, that, you might not see it, but I saw the item store.

2123
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:33,570
I, I,

2124
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:39,550
I see what you are on the left.

2125
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:41,850
I, I see you.

2126
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:52,520
What's this?

2127
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,180
Oh, these are for the, IRL items.

2128
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,440
I, I, I know what you are.

2129
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:05,460
I, I like how, I like how you do the slow pan for it.

2130
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,560
In this point?

2131
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,240
I don't, I don't know what In this point is.

2132
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:19,460
Maybe, I'm gonna look that up.

2133
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:30,250
Oh, look, if his video is still, up, my, my live stream will still be up, I believe.

2134
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,060
Alright, this is, this would be a fun place to come back to.

2135
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:41,520
I'm there, thank you for the raid, thank you, thank you.

2136
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:46,200
Sorry, I know like we spent, oh my god, nostalgia.

2137
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:55,660
This bag right here, nostalgia, right here, the classic.

2138
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:01,710
And, that was Cino Center.

2139
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:11,190
This was my go-to, uh, my go-to place when I went, whenever I want to shop for, like, figures and stuff, or, like, uh, cute things.

2140
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:14,230
Was it, what was it, Ena's?

2141
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:16,050
What is it called?

2142
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,250
The newer place that people go to now?

2143
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:23,310
Uh, because I never heard of that.

2144
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:24,430
What was it called?

2145
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:29,310
Ena, uh, uh,

2146
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,530
Ena's Point?

2147
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,530
I never heard of, I never heard of that place before.

2148
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:42,350
Ena's Point, Hong Kong, the best and cheapest Hong Kong display.

2149
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:47,310
I don't think I've been here before.

2150
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:48,210
Is this new?

2151
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:50,550
Ba-dum!

2152
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:54,610
BOMB!

2153
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:56,110
Um, holy shit.

2154
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:03,250
Holy, that's so intense.

2155
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:09,370
What the fuck is this Google Map shit?

2156
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:12,530
This is where to go.

2157
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:14,970
It's so epic.

2158
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:23,930
It's a very serious business, guys.

2159
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:28,010
Now there's a sound aside in a world.

2160
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:33,450
Alright.

2161
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:38,270
I've never been to this place before.

2162
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:42,550
Okay, I'm sorry.

2163
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:44,070
I'm not gonna listen to that.

2164
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:47,430
This is new.

2165
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:48,290
Yeah, this is new.

2166
01:37:48,370 --> 01:37:50,550
I've never been to an inn's place before.

2167
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:53,130
This is new for me.

2168
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:54,070
Of course!

2169
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:57,490
Oh my god.

2170
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:58,670
Oh, that's cute.

2171
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,510
It's old?

2172
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,630
I've never been to inn's place.

2173
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:08,810
For, uh...

2174
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:10,330
For shopping, for figures.

2175
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:13,550
I usually would be at Sina Center.

2176
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:19,170
But to be fair, that was like more than 10 plus years ago for me.

2177
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:26,860
You find tons of Cinemoro merch?

2178
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:27,420
Careful.

2179
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,240
Oh my god, there's Lego.

2180
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,880
I've been like...

2181
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,160
Okay, not gonna lie.

2182
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:35,500
Not gonna lie.

2183
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,820
I've been watching so many Lego shorts lately.

2184
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:38,920
It's so...

2185
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:39,200
Like...

2186
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:40,720
It's just so like...

2187
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,100
Interesting.

2188
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,020
It's very interesting.

2189
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,100
Like the Lego stuff.

2190
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,440
Oh my god, look at all the...

2191
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,400
There are so many...

2192
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:52,560
There are so many...

2193
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:52,720
There are so many...

2194
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:52,840
There are so many...

2195
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:52,920
There are so many...

2196
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,380
There are so many...

2197
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:53,920
There are so many...

2198
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:54,240
There are so many...

2199
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:54,300
There are so many...

2200
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,280
There are so many...

2201
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,620
There are so many...

2202
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:56,980
There are so many...

2203
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,040
There are so many...

2204
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:57,120
There are so many...

2205
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,420
There are so many...

2206
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:57,640
There are so many...

2207
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,860
There are so many...

2208
01:38:58,860 --> 01:38:59,820
There are so many...

2209
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:01,560
There are so many...

2210
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,460
There are so many...

2211
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:20,720
There are so many...

2212
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,860
So many posters.

2213
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,330
All right.

2214
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:31,810
Let's look at...

2215
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:35,910
Food in Hong Kong.

2216
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:37,310
All right.

2217
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:38,350
This is...

2218
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:40,570
Best Hong Kong street food.

2219
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:41,110
All right.

2220
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:43,370
Let's judge this.

2221
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:46,590
The first... okay, it's one out.

2222
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:48,250
Oh my god, I love these noodles.

2223
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:49,470
Oh my god.

2224
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,990
This noodles with...

2225
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:56,570
These noodles with la chuchun, so good.

2226
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:59,350
That shit is so fucking good.

2227
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:01,290
You're reacting to it now.

2228
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:08,250
It's so late for this.

2229
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:12,830
Is that bola, yo?

2230
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:19,790
We'll eat everything from a street food stall where the pyromaniac chef attracts hundreds of hungry people.

2231
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:21,370
Alright.

2232
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:21,810
Oh!

2233
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:22,930
Oh my god!

2234
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:24,490
Okay, I love these types of fish.

2235
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:29,810
I don't- I don't care.

2236
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:30,710
Show me the food.

2237
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:32,490
Oh my god.

2238
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:37,170
I remember taking, like, the ship tours on this.

2239
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:39,210
Where the seats can go back or forth.

2240
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,150
Cause, like, back then...

2241
01:40:43,150 --> 01:40:43,950
Um...

2242
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:46,750
This was, like, sort of the only way to, like, go back and forth.

2243
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:49,710
Cause there was no station back then that goes there.

2244
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:58,590
Hello, HSBC Bank.

2245
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:02,470
I like how- It was, like, the first food that comes to mind.

2246
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,090
There's HSBC Bank.

2247
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:12,770
Yeah, this place is buzzing.

2248
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:13,370
It's packed.

2249
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:14,450
I love the atmosphere.

2250
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:15,530
This...

2251
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:17,830
I mean, you know you're in Hong Kong when you're here.

2252
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:18,470
Here?

2253
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:20,050
Hello!

2254
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:22,270
Whoa!

2255
01:41:23,670 --> 01:41:24,630
What are you making?

2256
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:26,970
Oh man, this is so incredible to see.

2257
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:28,370
I mean, this is...

2258
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:29,570
really...

2259
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:31,190
behind the scenes.

2260
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,890
Chen Fun?

2261
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:32,950
That's not Chen Fun.

2262
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:34,330
That's...

2263
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:35,330
Is that...

2264
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:35,870
Hakao?

2265
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:37,170
What is that?

2266
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,210
Just their experience.

2267
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:40,850
I know it's dim sum, but, like, what you...

2268
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:44,050
The Chinese cleaver and just spreads it out into a perfect circular...

2269
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:44,390
What the...

2270
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:45,610
What dim sum is this?

2271
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:46,770
Or dim sum has this?

2272
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,910
Is that Hakao?

2273
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:52,310
It looks like Hakao.

2274
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:53,210
And they're making...

2275
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:54,910
In the process of making Hakao, which are the...

2276
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:55,330
Yeah!

2277
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:02,190
You can't revoke my Hong Kong card!

2278
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:04,710
I was able to tell it was Hakao.

2279
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:05,430
I...

2280
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:05,770
I...

2281
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:08,190
I...

2282
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:08,310
I...

2283
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,870
I...

2284
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:08,890
I...

2285
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:09,610
I was like...

2286
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:09,990
Yeah!

2287
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:11,430
One point!

2288
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:12,330
To me!

2289
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:13,390
I...

2290
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:13,650
I...

2291
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,070
I was right!

2292
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:19,390
I'm sorry.

2293
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:20,410
I was so happy.

2294
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:21,330
I...

2295
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:21,910
I was like...

2296
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:22,630
I was right!

2297
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:23,730
Oh!

2298
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:25,210
Um...

2299
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:26,210
Fuck!

2300
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:27,210
Ah!

2301
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:28,770
Um...

2302
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:29,350
It's...

2303
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:30,210
It's one of the fun.

2304
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:30,970
I...

2305
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:31,270
Ah!

2306
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:31,310
Ah!

2307
01:42:31,790 --> 01:42:35,510
I don't remember what is it called in Cantonese cause I don't like the...

2308
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:36,330
The cha...

2309
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:36,750
Like what is it?

2310
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:38,030
The chives the little- The garlic.

2311
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:41,650
It's not garlic, the- The- The thing in the meat.

2312
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:42,470
I don't like it.

2313
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:44,450
It's one of the chan fuan .

2314
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:45,530
Because...

2315
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:47,370
And I- I don't- But...

2316
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:48,330
But...

2317
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,010
Sorry...

2318
01:42:49,010 --> 01:42:50,230
But I don't...

2319
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:51,930
Çaerto chan fuan Is it çaception chan fuan?

2320
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:54,130
Yeah, I don't like the chive in it.

2321
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,930
I'm not a fan of the chive in it, is true...

2322
01:42:57,930 --> 01:42:59,930
The taste for it is like, not my favorite.

2323
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:09,150
It has, like, a... was it the bamboo sprout?

2324
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:12,030
Is it bamboo sprout?

2325
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:12,370
I don't know.

2326
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:15,390
I don't think it's chat, but it's, like, one thing that makes it, like, taste a little spicy.

2327
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:19,330
Oh my god, this is, like, memories.

2328
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:23,250
It's not chat.

2329
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:23,890
The bitter taste.

2330
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:26,410
Yeah, the bitter... it's a slightly bitter, spicy taste.

2331
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:27,770
The bean curd roll?

2332
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:28,430
Oh, this one.

2333
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,530
Oh, this one, I love it, yes.

2334
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:30,630
I don't like this.

2335
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:31,970
Oh, uh, that's alright.

2336
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,170
So when you hold it, you hold it at the side.

2337
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,120
Oh, I love... I love the little sponge cake.

2338
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,480
That's one of my favorites.

2339
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,300
Some dim sum.

2340
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:46,340
You gotta be a little bit aggressive, but I think that's part of the experience.

2341
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,260
That's what makes it.

2342
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:48,820
I travel for food.

2343
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:49,700
Oh, man, so good.

2344
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:51,460
We saw the whole process of them making...

2345
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,040
Kakao!

2346
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:52,940
That's my favorite.

2347
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,180
Shrimp and pork.

2348
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,800
And bamboo shoots.

2349
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:57,560
And bamboo shoots.

2350
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,600
That's my favorite.

2351
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,300
Yeah, with 辣椒芥...

2352
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:00,700
Yeah, with 辣椒芥...辣椒油.

2353
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:15,240
And then there's... Oh, he has 忠米鸡 next to him.

2354
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,520
To me, it brings back so many memories.

2355
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:24,660
Oh my god, um, um, 四叉米鸡.

2356
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,560
Oh, my guy.

2357
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,400
Oh, that looks so good.

2358
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:39,960
That looks good.

2359
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,760
Sticky rice.

2360
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,720
It's like classic.

2361
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,180
What the fuck?

2362
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:53,120
Where are they?

2363
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,300
This shit's fancy.

2364
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:56,480
What the fuck?

2365
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:04,620
I'm so used to eating, like, Hong Kong, like, you know, like, the street restaurants and stuff.

2366
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:05,620
I was like, what the fuck?

2367
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:07,080
This place looks fucking fancy.

2368
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,380
Yeah, this shit is...

2369
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,160
It's like, it's so different.

2370
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,460
That shit is expensive.

2371
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:22,640
That's like fucking Michelin.

2372
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:27,820
Are we...

2373
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,740
Are we on Hong Kong Island?

2374
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,440
Still in precision, so fast.

2375
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:35,480
Oh, my God.

2376
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,720
They're wearing, like, chef hats and everything.

2377
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:39,580
The pork.

2378
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:41,080
You see some fat in there.

2379
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,220
You see some shrimp in there.

2380
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:45,560
And he takes kind of like a mixture of it with a little...

2381
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,860
From $30 to $300.

2382
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,780
Oh, is this...

2383
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:52,260
Oh, is this...

2384
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:52,600
Oh, my God.

2385
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,030
You know that this is expensive.

2386
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,060
Expensive.

2387
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,560
They have this shit.

2388
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,240
This shit is so expensive.

2389
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,900
Underneath is the diced chicken with mushrooms.

2390
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:04,740
I don't remember...

2391
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:07,160
I don't know what they are, but I know that shit is expensive.

2392
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,600
Because, like, my mom makes me eat one if they order it.

2393
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:13,620
Because they'd be like, we spent lots of money for this.

2394
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:16,060
You know, okay.

2395
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:19,240
I don't know if anyone's parents are like this.

2396
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:21,820
But, like, whenever my parents...

2397
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:25,660
Like, whenever my family order really expensive shit, They forced me to eat it.

2398
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:28,640
Because they're like, we spent a lot of money on this.

2399
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:29,960
You have to eat it.

2400
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,460
Even if I don't like it.

2401
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:41,360
Oh, my God.

2402
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,500
That shit looks good, though.

2403
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,440
Sumai.

2404
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:52,140
This is fancy fucking Sumai.

2405
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:01,540
It looks like this, but the top part is like...

2406
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,560
Has like, like, the little, the eggs on top.

2407
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,360
Like the, like, the little fish eggs.

2408
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:10,100
But that shit looks fucking fancy.

2409
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:15,040
With a carrot on the bottom?

2410
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,440
Holy shit.

2411
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,220
What the fuck is on top of that?

2412
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:24,840
This is in your mouth.

2413
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:25,960
Or is it crab eggs?

2414
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:26,640
I don't know.

2415
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:27,900
Incredible.

2416
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,140
Legendary.

2417
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,380
Okay, now we're...

2418
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,040
This is...

2419
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:37,400
Okay.

2420
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,520
This looks good, though.

2421
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:39,940
Oh, my God.

2422
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:40,620
There's live crab.

2423
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,660
Oh, shit.

2424
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,420
Oh, my God.

2425
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:51,440
Oh, that looks good.

2426
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,740
Oh, it's this dish.

2427
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,180
I know this dish.

2428
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,640
I know this.

2429
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,600
I know this dish.

2430
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,500
Yeah, you...

2431
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:06,440
If you guys didn't know, you have to boil crabs and lobsters, like crustaceans alive for the best taste.

2432
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:08,340
Which is pretty fucked up.

2433
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:09,660
But, like, um...

2434
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:13,140
That's, like, apparently, like, how you're supposed to cook them.

2435
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:17,840
Because, like, the more alive they are when you boil them, the tastier it is.

2436
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,880
What an incredible recipe.

2437
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,100
So, oil goes in the...

2438
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,760
Uh, dungeon, welcome to tomato farm.

2439
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:23,460
Welcome, welcome.

2440
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:27,260
The screams of pain adds flavor.

2441
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:28,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2442
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,100
Scorches.

2443
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,760
The flavor is fully released.

2444
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:33,320
Then some chili goes in.

2445
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,460
Then the crab goes in.

2446
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,800
He artfully places that around, and it lets them walk.

2447
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:37,540
Roar.

2448
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,500
Yeah, don't make it quick to release something that makes it taste very bad.

2449
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:41,920
Yeah.

2450
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:43,480
So, like...

2451
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:45,320
So, like, that's how they do it.

2452
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:46,780
That's...

2453
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:46,820
Oh.

2454
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:47,420
That's...

2455
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,480
I like it with...

2456
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:48,840
That, too.

2457
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:50,400
I like it with this.

2458
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:52,320
Okay.

2459
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,220
Oh, this looks so good.

2460
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:55,640
Oh, my gosh.

2461
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:58,320
Oh, that...

2462
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:58,520
Okay.

2463
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:00,140
This is classic.

2464
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,480
This is, like, a classic place to eat.

2465
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,620
When you're, like, in these types of restaurants.

2466
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:07,680
Because you know it's, like, all about the food.

2467
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

2468
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:09,960
The brisket.

2469
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:10,620
You can see that.

2470
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,800
I love going to these types of restaurants.

2471
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:14,480
At the same time.

2472
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:15,360
Yeah.

2473
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:15,480
Yeah.

2474
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:16,980
Like, they...

2475
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:18,220
And then, like...

2476
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:19,800
I remember my mom took me to one of these.

2477
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:22,700
And then there is, like, they had, like, news articles of, like...

2478
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,980
People being, like, wow!

2479
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,540
Mr. Wah, they've won Hong Kong awards.

2480
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:27,040
This place is...

2481
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:27,820
Yeah, this is...

2482
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,100
By the way, this is a Michelin star restaurant, by the way.

2483
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,060
Local Hong Kong awards.

2484
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,020
Yeah, I know, like...

2485
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:35,860
Pictures all over the walls and awards.

2486
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:38,900
This is literally a local Michelin star restaurant.

2487
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:44,520
We also got a bonus of their brisket curry.

2488
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:44,800
Oh?

2489
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,280
Which I'm very excited about as well.

2490
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,100
I think different parts of the brisket...

2491
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,840
Oh, man.

2492
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,440
That looks rich and thick and...

2493
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:50,760
Oh.

2494
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:51,500
Oh.

2495
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:52,800
That looks good.

2496
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:55,140
Prince Edward Station!

2497
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,960
For a quick tour to eat...

2498
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,300
Iconic Hong Kong street foods.

2499
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,580
Most of them on sticks.

2500
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:02,820
Ah!

2501
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,360
Okay, here we go.

2502
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,500
Pull it out of the bag.

2503
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:06,260
What the fuck is that?

2504
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,860
Virginia seasoned it for us.

2505
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:08,760
What is that?

2506
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:09,700
That's a whole...

2507
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,200
Yeah, whole...

2508
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,520
It's a whole brick of tofu.

2509
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,600
That tofu?

2510
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,480
Oh my god.

2511
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:15,140
It's...

2512
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:17,000
You know, I thought...

2513
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:20,200
I thought, you know...

2514
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,280
When they're like, we're gonna go street food.

2515
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,780
I thought like...

2516
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:26,560
That he was gonna get the classic one.

2517
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,580
Which was...

2518
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,460
You know...

2519
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:29,420
Sumai or...

2520
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:31,000
Or gala yu dan.

2521
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,260
Not tofu.

2522
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,420
You know?

2523
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:38,180
I feel like...

2524
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:40,060
Sumai or gala yu dan.

2525
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:40,840
Is like...

2526
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,100
More classic.

2527
01:50:45,420 --> 01:50:46,180
Or...

2528
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:47,640
Gai dan jai.

2529
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:48,700
Really crispy.

2530
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,560
And then really juicy on the inside.

2531
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:52,540
Juicy and crumbly.

2532
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,300
Almost cheesy.

2533
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:54,380
This is classic.

2534
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:55,540
But like...

2535
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:55,880
My...

2536
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:57,200
I feel like...

2537
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:58,300
I feel like...

2538
01:50:59,480 --> 01:50:59,780
Um...

2539
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:00,260
Um...

2540
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:00,440
I...

2541
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,140
I personally like the...

2542
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:03,480
The yu...

2543
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,340
Gala yu dan.

2544
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:04,780
More.

2545
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:05,180
Better.

2546
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,700
There's a wet wipe.

2547
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,600
I personally like the taste of...

2548
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:10,340
Gala yu dan.

2549
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:10,860
More.

2550
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,340
Than the...

2551
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:13,360
The stinky tofu.

2552
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:14,220
Fried intestines?

2553
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,040
Okay, excellent.

2554
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:21,090
What's that?

2555
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:24,630
He pokes it with a skewer.

2556
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:25,490
Slices it off.

2557
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:26,950
Wait, I know you've seen this one before.

2558
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:27,810
Nice.

2559
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:28,310
What is that?

2560
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:30,610
Okay, soy sauce.

2561
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:30,970
Yep.

2562
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,030
Tangy sauce.

2563
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:33,210
And then mustard.

2564
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,010
Is that intestines?

2565
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:34,510
Okay.

2566
01:51:35,490 --> 01:51:35,830
Oh, nice.

2567
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:37,410
Oh, is that fried intestines?

2568
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:39,670
I've never had this one before.

2569
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:41,750
The mustard makes...

2570
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:42,270
We have...

2571
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:42,930
73.

2572
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:45,430
Where's my garlic yu di Sony?

2573
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,390
Did he leave?!

2574
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:52,470
Thisot.

2575
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:53,310
Did he leave?!

2576
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,070
What the fuck is...?

2577
01:51:55,070 --> 01:51:56,770
I can't believe he left.

2578
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:59,090
hiosa lige news has been a legendary one a Ummm офperry since 1976.

2579
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,870
Curry fish ball has two comments.

2580
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,130
What do you mean?!

2581
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:03,490
It's...

2582
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:03,830
is Greek.

2583
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:05,850
It'sומing peak.

2584
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:06,730
Open this up.

2585
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:08,330
The famous legendary.

2586
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:09,030
Hong Kong...

2587
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:12,890
pretend to ding much...

2588
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:15,770
And we also got it with the... the butter already sliced on the inside.

2589
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:17,330
Nice.

2590
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:18,410
This is so good.

2591
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:19,450
I love Bolo.

2592
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:21,730
I'm getting angry.

2593
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:27,230
How dare you not eat my favorite classic Hong Kong food?

2594
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:28,950
How dare you?

2595
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:35,550
I can't believe it.

2596
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:36,430
Oh!

2597
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:37,570
Yay!

2598
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:40,810
Yay!

2599
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:41,130
Yay!

2600
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,730
Okay, I'll eat redeemed.

2601
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:47,770
I think it's like the most iconic strip food.

2602
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,670
I told...

2603
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:50,170
She said it too!

2604
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:53,190
It's the most iconic strip...

2605
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:55,390
I... SHE SAID IT TOO!

2606
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:56,610
What?

2607
01:52:58,950 --> 01:52:59,630
Look at that.

2608
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,270
Happiness is back.

2609
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:06,530
It's like I'm there.

2610
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:08,230
Maybe I don't need to take a vacation.

2611
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:11,530
I can just... I can just watch these YouTube videos.

2612
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:16,590
It's like I'm right there, right now.

2613
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:20,530
Toki, please.

2614
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:24,090
I'm living vicariously through these videos right now.

2615
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:34,410
What the fuck?

2616
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:38,070
What is this?

2617
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:38,970
What?

2618
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:39,970
What is this?

2619
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:44,370
Food, Marks, Coca-Cola?

2620
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:48,650
And this place, they're very famous for their Hong Kong style clay pot rice.

2621
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:51,590
But how are they able to crank out thousands...

2622
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:53,150
Oh, clay pot!

2623
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:54,110
K-pop?

2624
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:54,910
A clay pot!

2625
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:57,570
Oh, I love clay pot rice.

2626
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:02,450
Somebody actually ordered me a rice cooker on his own.

2627
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:05,470
...basket after basket full of the clay pots, and they only serve one size.

2628
01:54:05,650 --> 01:54:07,090
It's a personal pot size.

2629
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:10,190
And so he's just putting one bowl of rice.

2630
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:12,370
That's so good.

2631
01:54:12,690 --> 01:54:17,250
You get together some of the different conversions with chicken, with pork, ginger, and green onions as well.

2632
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:22,710
Whoa, only 15 minutes?

2633
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:25,730
Oh my god, this only takes 15 minutes to make.

2634
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:26,490
He's not even measuring.

2635
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:28,510
He just knows from experience how much water to put in.

2636
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:30,810
Turn off the fires.

2637
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:34,410
Oh my god, that's a lot of clay pots.

2638
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:40,450
So that's a full rack, all 30 clay pots going at once, all the fires cranking.

2639
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:42,870
That's so much heat radiating off of here.

2640
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:46,730
It takes so much concentration and dedication.

2641
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:49,450
It's almost like he's playing an instrument when he's lifting the wings.

2642
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:50,310
That's so cool.

2643
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:52,930
That's so cool.

2644
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:54,710
Oh my god.

2645
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:55,950
Pie quite fine.

2646
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:59,150
That's so good.

2647
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:03,870
That's so good.

2648
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:08,150
I'm gonna go to some of these places this guy is recommending.

2649
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:10,490
Oh my god, I'm only not even halfway.

2650
01:55:10,690 --> 01:55:12,690
How long have I been watching this video of just food?

2651
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:21,130
I'm sorry.

2652
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:26,310
I couldn't help it.

2653
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:28,890
It's literally just food.

2654
01:55:29,450 --> 01:55:30,430
I love these.

2655
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:30,810
I love, I love this type of dish for fish.

2656
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:34,710
This stuff, rather than being flaky, the grouper is flaky.

2657
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:37,610
The thread print is more creamy and soft, I think.

2658
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:39,610
But really, incredible...

2659
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:42,330
I love these, I love, I love this type of dish.

2660
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:42,850
Fish for fish.

2661
01:55:43,330 --> 01:55:44,410
This is like childhood.

2662
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:46,330
For me, it's a childhood meal.

2663
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:47,570
For me.

2664
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:53,590
Like, I grew up with this type of, like, uh, how my parents would make fish for me.

2665
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,490
Or, like, my grandparents.

2666
01:55:58,810 --> 01:55:59,750
What is it?

2667
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:01,810
Oh, they actually have two locations.

2668
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:03,550
One around the corner, one here.

2669
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:05,110
But I think this one is the original one.

2670
01:56:05,230 --> 01:56:05,810
This is the spot.

2671
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:07,670
This is a very popular place.

2672
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:10,430
We had to wait a little while at the door, but we made it in pretty fast.

2673
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,090
Lau-som-ki-noodle.

2674
01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:16,950
This is a legendary restaurant dating back to 1956.

2675
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:19,890
It's three generations still in the family.

2676
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:23,150
And they are most famous for their one-ton noodles.

2677
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,290
Oh, wait, I've been here!

2678
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:26,790
No, I've been here!

2679
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,110
I remembered!

2680
01:56:28,330 --> 01:56:29,210
I know this place!

2681
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:32,310
They still make their own noodles, and they still use the bamboo.

2682
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:33,250
I've been here before!

2683
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:34,290
You need the dough.

2684
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:35,670
Ah, so it's fresh.

2685
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:36,270
It's quality.

2686
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:37,850
My parents took me here.

2687
01:56:39,010 --> 01:56:39,530
Yeah!

2688
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,190
This one is the classic.

2689
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:42,550
Just the egg noodles.

2690
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:43,390
It's so good.

2691
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:45,570
The noodles with the one-ton.

2692
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:47,530
One-ton mean.

2693
01:56:49,990 --> 01:56:51,090
It's so good.

2694
01:56:51,190 --> 01:56:52,690
This is actually really, really good.

2695
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:55,250
I miss that.

2696
01:56:58,150 --> 01:56:59,630
I've never eaten this one, though.

2697
01:56:59,810 --> 01:57:00,970
I just eat the one-ton mean.

2698
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:03,670
All right.

2699
01:57:04,050 --> 01:57:04,670
Where are they?

2700
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:07,130
Oh, this place!

2701
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:11,410
One of the original boats, a sampan, and we're gonna enjoy another- Causeway Bay.

2702
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:16,270
One of the original boats, a sampan, and we're gonna enjoy another seafood meal.

2703
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:19,090
Causeway Bay is like a classic area.

2704
01:57:19,090 --> 01:57:20,170
Typhoon shelter.

2705
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:28,210
This is like such a- It's a very classic tourist spot, I would say.

2706
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:30,230
A lot of tourists come here.

2707
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:33,910
This is absolutely incredible.

2708
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:36,630
We've gotten dropped off in our own sampan.

2709
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:41,050
And this is a taste of the traditional culture of fishing boat culture.

2710
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:41,830
Wait, what?

2711
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,290
I've never done this before.

2712
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:47,310
And yet it's so traditional here.

2713
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:49,190
Wait, I actually want to do this when I'm there.

2714
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:50,150
That's so cool.

2715
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:55,510
These were invented some of the dishes, uh, within these boats cooking for fishermen.

2716
01:57:55,630 --> 01:57:56,490
But that's so cool!

2717
01:57:56,750 --> 01:58:00,510
Yeah, if you guys didn't know, Hong Kong was originally a fisherman village.

2718
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:03,970
Um, it was just a small village for- to fish.

2719
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:06,910
And this is- That's so cool!

2720
01:58:08,170 --> 01:58:12,090
Basically, we have four early ethnic, like, clans in Hong Kong.

2721
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:13,650
The Puntys and the Hakkas.

2722
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:15,590
And then they took the farmable land.

2723
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:22,390
So then the Tenkas and the Haklos- Oh, there's the- the burnt crab.

2724
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:24,470
The Boiled Alive crab.

2725
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:27,190
Oh, it's so pretty!

2726
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:30,390
Christmas in Hong Kong is really, really pretty.

2727
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:32,470
With the light decorations.

2728
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:35,310
Oh!

2729
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:39,010
And it just came out of the oven.

2730
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:39,410
Oh!

2731
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:40,390
Oh!

2732
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:48,810
You can tell that they specialize in Chasu and that's one of the favorite things that you said.

2733
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:50,330
Chasu?

2734
01:58:50,330 --> 01:58:50,830
Chasu!

2735
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:53,710
Stalagmites and stalactites and they just- I look so juicy!

2736
01:58:54,810 --> 01:58:55,930
Oh my god!

2737
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:58,550
I love Chasu!

2738
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:58,650
Chasu!

2739
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:00,730
Okay, you know what I just- I noticed?

2740
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:02,050
I found out?

2741
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:03,330
I didn't realize this.

2742
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:09,510
But, um, a lot of like- I think like- I don't know if it's like how we prepare it.

2743
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:10,970
Like how Hong Kong people prepare it.

2744
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:12,690
But we love fatty meat.

2745
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:19,250
Like, cause like, um, I was recommending some food to one of my friends.

2746
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:23,670
Um, and my friend was like, ooh, I don't really like all this fat meat.

2747
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:25,530
Um, I like prefer lean meat.

2748
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:29,710
And I didn't know- I didn't realize that, like, we love fatty meat.

2749
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:31,430
The flavor from it, yeah.

2750
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:36,170
I like- Yeah, I didn't even realize that.

2751
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:42,890
I can't tell the difference between- Um, I can't tell the difference between like fat meat and lean meat.

2752
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:45,730
I just- If it tastes good, then it's good.

2753
01:59:46,170 --> 01:59:46,790
Yeah, exactly.

2754
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:48,290
I was like, but the flavor though.

2755
01:59:48,450 --> 01:59:49,150
Yeah, exactly.

2756
01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:51,750
I was like, the flavor is so good though.

2757
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:53,950
As long as it's good.

2758
01:59:54,230 --> 01:59:55,130
Oh my god.

2759
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:56,850
Kobe.

2760
01:59:57,850 --> 01:59:59,450
The next LeBron James.

2761
01:59:59,970 --> 02:00:00,770
Like, holy shit.

2762
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,490
He doesn't even have to look.

2763
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:10,050
He literally just like- He literally was just like-

2764
02:00:13,110 --> 02:00:14,310
Muscle memory.

2765
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:17,190
You know how to throw those meats.

2766
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:24,010
That's how you know that- Oh my god.

2767
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:27,450
That's how you know that man's a fucking pro.

2768
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:28,730
That uncle's a pro.

2769
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:29,970
Right there.

2770
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:33,530
Is this- Oh, I'm guy?

2771
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:38,870
I love- I love cold chicken.

2772
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:41,930
That shit's my favorite.

2773
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:46,830
Tatsu.

2774
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:50,130
Okay.

2775
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:56,010
Oh.

2776
02:01:01,070 --> 02:01:02,550
Oh, that looks so good.

2777
02:01:02,750 --> 02:01:03,910
Oh, with the sauce too.

2778
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:11,870
And the green- In the green, uh- In the green little plate.

2779
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:13,990
Without eating roast goose.

2780
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:15,210
That's so true.

2781
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:16,010
We should love dark meat.

2782
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:19,190
Are you ready for that reveal of the cross-section?

2783
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:20,250
Oh.

2784
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:23,710
With the crispy skin- Sweet plum sauce.

2785
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:24,050
Yeah.

2786
02:01:24,630 --> 02:01:25,850
The juices are pouring out.

2787
02:01:26,490 --> 02:01:28,650
We love to eat any types of birds.

2788
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:34,390
Like, uh- Like hot- Uh, not hot- For the- The cod.

2789
02:01:34,710 --> 02:01:35,270
Um.

2790
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:36,650
Ah!

2791
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:37,570
What is it called?

2792
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:41,590
The- What was it?

2793
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:43,370
The one- For the- The pigeons.

2794
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:45,410
What are the pigeons one called again?

2795
02:01:45,850 --> 02:01:46,410
UGAP!

2796
02:01:46,810 --> 02:01:47,270
UGAP!

2797
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:48,790
I love UGAP!

2798
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:51,130
It dances on your tongue.

2799
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:52,610
So good.

2800
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:54,630
That's pigeon, by the way.

2801
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:56,970
That's why you don't see pigeons around.

2802
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:58,110
Because we eat them!

2803
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:01,130
They're so good!

2804
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:12,670
Nice and peon!

2805
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:14,970
No, that's not the reason!

2806
02:02:18,790 --> 02:02:22,750
But just- By the way, you guys didn't know.

2807
02:02:22,770 --> 02:02:23,710
I'm joking, guys.

2808
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:24,790
I'm joking.

2809
02:02:25,230 --> 02:02:27,030
But UGAP is really, really good.

2810
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:33,990
Just so you guys know, I'm only- I'm joking, guys.

2811
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,350
I'm- I'm joking.

2812
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:46,080
I already believe in you.

2813
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:54,920
Okay, but does anyone remember that fast food Hong Kong chain?

2814
02:02:56,440 --> 02:03:00,760
It's called- Because, like, that's actually one of my guilty pleasures to go there.

2815
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:08,580
Like, I know it's like- Like, the really famous fast food Hong Kong chain, where you can get, like, Hong Kong food, but for fast food.

2816
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:09,940
What is it called?

2817
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:10,540
They're everywhere.

2818
02:03:10,900 --> 02:03:13,720
I don't remember what it's called, but I love- CAFE DECORA!

2819
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,040
I love that place!

2820
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:18,400
It's like our equivalent.

2821
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,680
It's like basically, like, Hong Kong fast food.

2822
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:22,380
Yes.

2823
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:23,760
DAI...

2824
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,160
Uh, CAFE DECORA.

2825
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:27,720
Or is it- Is it DAI FAHLO?

2826
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:29,000
I think there's two of them.

2827
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:30,960
Isn't it CAFE DECORA or DAI FAHLO?

2828
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:31,280
Heya.

2829
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,900
DAI FAHLO- Uh, DAI- Is it DAI FAHLO?

2830
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:42,640
Or DAI- Uh, DAI-GA- DAI-JAU- DAI-DAI-GA-MING- Yes, DAI-GA-LÙ-T-HARA!

2831
02:03:42,860 --> 02:03:43,500
DAI-GA-LÙ-T-HARA!

2832
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,420
And CAFE DECORA.

2833
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,820
That is my guilty pleasure.

2834
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:48,800
I like both of them.

2835
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:50,980
But- Both of them are like my favorite.

2836
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,540
And, yeah.

2837
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:53,280
Stay tuned for the first time.

2838
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:53,680
DAI-GA-LO!

2839
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:54,020
Yes!

2840
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:55,080
DAI-GA-LO!

2841
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:56,820
DAI-GA-LO!

2842
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:56,900
DAI-GA-LO!

2843
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:57,680
DAI-GA-LO!

2844
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:08,760
DAI-GA-LO!

2845
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:13,280
There's like a little rivalry between them.

2846
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:17,100
Some people don't tell them that they fight over me.

2847
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:22,440
There's like a little rivalry between the two.

2848
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,580
So it's like, you know how there used to be a rivalry between McDonald's versus Burger King?

2849
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:30,900
That, for us, it's Daikalo versus Daifaiwo.

2850
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:34,180
And people would argue which one is better.

2851
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:39,460
There's like beef.

2852
02:04:51,370 --> 02:04:53,710
It's like, yeah, Coke versus Pepsi.

2853
02:04:55,130 --> 02:04:56,790
Which one was better for me?

2854
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:58,070
Whichever one was closer.

2855
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:05,410
Whichever one that's there, like conveniently close to me, I would go.

2856
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:13,650
But I like that place because it's like fast food for Hong Kong food.

2857
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:15,990
So it's like my guilty pleasure.

2858
02:05:17,950 --> 02:05:19,530
Food is food, exactly.

2859
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:20,550
Food is food.

2860
02:05:21,070 --> 02:05:21,550
Wait, okay.

2861
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:23,610
I want to show you guys...

2862
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:27,030
Wait, I want to know if anyone made a video.

2863
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:29,310
Okay, that's enough from this guy.

2864
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:29,670
Okay.

2865
02:05:31,210 --> 02:05:33,590
I want to know if anyone made a video of this restaurant.

2866
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:35,210
My favorite restaurant.

2867
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:36,870
In...

2868
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:37,670
In, uh...

2869
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:40,990
In Hong Kong.

2870
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:43,870
I'm so sad.

2871
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:47,250
No one has made a video of my favorite restaurant.

2872
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:51,570
I want to see if anyone made a video of my favorite restaurant called Tomato Club.

2873
02:05:58,650 --> 02:05:59,790
Hong Kong citizen here.

2874
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:03,330
Why your research Hong Kong streams better than I showed speeds high stream...

2875
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:04,110
Hong Kong stream.

2876
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:05,690
I never heard of small boat ride.

2877
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:06,010
I know!

2878
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:06,850
That's so cool!

2879
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:08,330
Was that cool?

2880
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:09,490
That was so cool!

2881
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:10,990
I didn't even realize that existed!

2882
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:12,610
I didn't even know that existed!

2883
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:13,630
I want to go there.

2884
02:06:14,290 --> 02:06:15,650
Autobot, thank you for the super chat.

2885
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:16,650
Thank you, thank you.

2886
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:17,830
I get to eat in a boat?

2887
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,030
In a tiny ass boat?

2888
02:06:19,130 --> 02:06:20,170
That shit's so cool.

2889
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:25,130
I'm sad.

2890
02:06:25,810 --> 02:06:29,890
I can't believe they don't have my favorite restaurant in a video.

2891
02:06:30,290 --> 02:06:31,910
I can't believe it!

2892
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:33,810
It's such a good restaurant!

2893
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:39,190
It's one of my favorite places to eat!

2894
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:41,570
Why don't they have it?

2895
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:43,750
If you...

2896
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:44,470
Okay, guys.

2897
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:45,850
I'm advertising.

2898
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:48,110
This is actually my favorite place.

2899
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:51,290
Tomato Club, Hong Kong.

2900
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:55,230
If you are in Hong Kong, you have to go to the tomato club.

2901
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,010
I swear to God.

2902
02:06:56,150 --> 02:06:56,950
It's so good.

2903
02:06:57,110 --> 02:06:57,250
Okay.

2904
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:58,810
Like, I'm not coping.

2905
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:00,190
It's actually so good.

2906
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:07,130
This is actually legitimately one of my favorite places.

2907
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:09,450
Um...

2908
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:09,970
Okay.

2909
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:11,510
I tell...

2910
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:12,910
Okay, I'll give you a reason why.

2911
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:14,130
It's one of my favorite...

2912
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:15,270
My favorite places.

2913
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:16,670
I will show you guys why.

2914
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:18,410
Let me find...

2915
02:07:18,970 --> 02:07:20,510
They only have their website.

2916
02:07:20,770 --> 02:07:24,090
They used to have two locations, but I think they only have one now.

2917
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:25,990
Which makes me sad.

2918
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:27,310
Because I know that...

2919
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:29,430
They had one in Satine.

2920
02:07:31,530 --> 02:07:32,130
Um...

2921
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:32,410
Uh...

2922
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:34,690
It's where she was a boy.

2923
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:35,690
No...

2924
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,470
I'm so sad about it.

2925
02:07:37,810 --> 02:07:38,250
I think...

2926
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:40,330
Um...

2927
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:42,310
They used to have one in...

2928
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:43,130
In Satine.

2929
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:44,350
But I think it's...

2930
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:45,270
Uh...

2931
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:46,950
I think it's gone now.

2932
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:48,470
Which makes me a little sad.

2933
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:49,690
Because...

2934
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:50,750
Okay, so...

2935
02:07:51,390 --> 02:07:52,470
Okay, so...

2936
02:07:54,090 --> 02:07:54,850
Uh...

2937
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:56,510
So...

2938
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:58,010
This is Tomato Club.

2939
02:07:58,150 --> 02:08:01,410
And what makes Tomato Club so fucking good...

2940
02:08:01,410 --> 02:08:02,970
Is that...

2941
02:08:02,970 --> 02:08:04,430
The whole thing...

2942
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:05,450
Is that...

2943
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:06,770
There's like...

2944
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:07,570
Three...

2945
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:08,130
The whole...

2946
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:11,070
The soup base is literally tomato soup.

2947
02:08:11,370 --> 02:08:12,490
And like...

2948
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:15,010
You can choose what noodles you want.

2949
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:18,110
So it can be like any type of noodles you want.

2950
02:08:18,750 --> 02:08:20,350
And also, like...

2951
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:22,710
The scrambled egg on top is what makes it really good too.

2952
02:08:23,130 --> 02:08:24,570
So it's like...

2953
02:08:24,570 --> 02:08:25,090
Um...

2954
02:08:27,810 --> 02:08:29,470
You can choose any noodles...

2955
02:08:29,470 --> 02:08:31,250
You can choose it to be spicy.

2956
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,470
Um...

2957
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:34,290
You can make it spicy or non-spicy.

2958
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:35,170
And you put any...

2959
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:37,670
Any toppings you want.

2960
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:39,630
Um...

2961
02:08:39,630 --> 02:08:41,190
Any toppings you want too.

2962
02:08:41,670 --> 02:08:42,130
So like...

2963
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:43,670
Yeah, as many toppings as you want.

2964
02:08:43,770 --> 02:08:45,410
And like, you customize it fully.

2965
02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:49,630
So this is one of my favorite places to go to.

2966
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:53,130
We got one named... There's a new one?

2967
02:08:53,650 --> 02:08:54,210
No.

2968
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:58,150
Don't say that about Tomato Club.

2969
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:59,790
I grew up with Tomato Club.

2970
02:09:00,110 --> 02:09:02,250
Don't you dare say it's bitter or not.

2971
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:13,890
Don't do that to me.

2972
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:20,470
How dare you insult Tomato Club.

2973
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:23,290
Respect your alters.

2974
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:25,190
Tomato Club was there first.

2975
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:34,530
She got protective of her tomato oshi.

2976
02:09:35,130 --> 02:09:36,210
I'm sorry.

2977
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:42,070
PG, thank you for the super chat.

2978
02:09:42,530 --> 02:09:43,050
Thank you.

2979
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,970
Thank you.

2980
02:09:52,210 --> 02:09:53,850
I'm the number one.

2981
02:09:54,010 --> 02:09:55,010
You don't understand.

2982
02:09:55,490 --> 02:10:01,390
I would beg my dad to take me to Tomato Club, like, almost every day.

2983
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:03,550
Like, I did not get tired of that shit.

2984
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:13,490
I am Tomato Club's number one fan.

2985
02:10:14,630 --> 02:10:17,710
You know how, like, um, I remember what it's called.

2986
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:18,910
What is it, Mr. Donut?

2987
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:26,150
Like, Fuomoko did the whole, like, the whole, um, like, you're talking about their favorite, like, donut place.

2988
02:10:26,150 --> 02:10:29,510
This is, this is, this is my favorite place.

2989
02:10:34,290 --> 02:10:36,370
This is my favorite place.

2990
02:10:36,370 --> 02:10:36,430
This is my favorite place.

2991
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:38,350
Don't you dare take it away from me.

2992
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:45,030
Like, no, no negotiate.

2993
02:10:45,450 --> 02:10:48,990
I am, I am, I am, I am Tomato Club's number one fan.

2994
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:51,870
I am, I am, I am Tomato Club.

2995
02:10:52,170 --> 02:10:55,050
I turn into Gollum suddenly.

2996
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:55,390
Definitely.

2997
02:10:57,610 --> 02:11:01,190
Yeah, but it's my favorite place to go eat.

2998
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:05,830
It's like a childhood place for me because I would tell my dad to take me there almost every other day.

2999
02:11:05,950 --> 02:11:07,910
And then my dad was like, are you not tired of this place?

3000
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:08,810
I was like, no.

3001
02:11:11,950 --> 02:11:13,310
I'm like, no.

3002
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:16,190
I would die eating Tomito Club.

3003
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:24,390
My dad would, like, beg me to, like, stop.

3004
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:26,390
I don't want to go to Tomato Club.

3005
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:30,130
It's like, I want to... I want to go to Tomato Club.

3006
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:38,970
You dare question my everlasting love for Tomato Club?

3007
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:39,590
Exactly.

3008
02:11:43,630 --> 02:11:44,290
Let's see.

3009
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:49,650
Tomato Ching is better.

3010
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:51,270
Seeing is better.

3011
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:52,330
Rock, rock.

3012
02:11:52,530 --> 02:11:54,090
Thank you for the super chat.

3013
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:54,570
Thank you.

3014
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:56,190
When did they come up?

3015
02:11:56,310 --> 02:11:58,710
I bet you Tomato Club has been around longer.

3016
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:01,850
Respect your elders.

3017
02:12:03,190 --> 02:12:03,650
All right.

3018
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:05,750
I'm checking when they showed up.

3019
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,890
Okay.

3020
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:09,350
When did they show up?

3021
02:12:09,450 --> 02:12:10,090
Oh my God.

3022
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,170
You can't feed them.

3023
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:12,410
Okay.

3024
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:13,330
Let's see.

3025
02:12:13,330 --> 02:12:19,610
When did... When did... When did... When did Tomato Seahang ever pop, like, showed up in this world?

3026
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:21,270
Samsoi Po?

3027
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:22,650
Is that Samsoi Po?

3028
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:23,490
Okay.

3029
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:24,210
Where is it?

3030
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:25,470
Okay.

3031
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:27,350
I'm looking at the oldest review.

3032
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:30,290
This shit just got real.

3033
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:32,150
Ha ha ha ha.

3034
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:33,410

02:12:34,650 --> 02:12:35,990
Ha ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha.

3038
02:12:37,770 --> 02:12:38,450
Ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha.

Ha ha ha ha.

comento club was there when the recipe was written.百歓 capturedéléselfласти.

3044
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:46,170
Respect your elders.

3045
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:47,850
All right.

3046
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:49,390
Let's see.

3047
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:50,450
What other places do I want?

3048
02:12:50,710 --> 02:12:51,410
Wait, Monkey.

3049
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:53,570
What is Monkey Mountain called?

3050
02:12:53,950 --> 02:12:56,090
Monkey Mountain Hong Kong.

3051
02:12:56,590 --> 02:12:57,950
What is it actually called?

3052
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:58,690
Oh, there it is.

3053
02:12:58,810 --> 02:13:01,250
Oh my god, they actually... Okay, Monkey Hill.

3054
02:13:01,530 --> 02:13:02,110
This place.

3055
02:13:03,730 --> 02:13:05,930
This is the place where I would always dry pass.

3056
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:11,320
This is it.

3057
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,860
Look, it's just a... Look, they're just sitting there.

3058
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,220
This is Monkey Mountain.

3059
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:16,180
Monkey Hill.

3060
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:16,360
Oh my god.

3061
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:19,380
It's literally Monkey Hill.

3062
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:24,040
It's just monkeys everywhere.

3063
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:27,940
And then my parents would be like, we don't want to go to Monkey Hill.

3064
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:32,520
We don't... You don't want to see the monkeys in Monkey Hill.

3065
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:36,360
And I always see them whenever we drive past Monkey Hill.

3066
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:41,820
I'd be like, I want to... I want to meet the monkeys.

3067
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:46,800
Yeah, they apparently like to steal stuff.

3068
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:49,460
And like, they really like to steal stuff.

3069
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:51,760
They're chill until they're not.

3070
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:59,200
Look at her.

3071
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:00,540
Oh my god.

3072
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:02,700
Look, see?

3073
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:03,620
They're okay.

3074
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:06,260
Those children are okay with the monkeys.

3075
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:08,100
Oh my god.

3076
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:09,920
Oh

3077
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,460
my god.

3078
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:19,560
Oh my god.

3079
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:20,300
What the fuck?

3080
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:22,360
They gave the monkey bubble tea?

3081
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:23,640
They...

3082
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:27,020
Oh my god.

3083
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:28,600
Did he just give the

3084
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:32,910
monkey...

3085
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:34,450
He gave the monkey...

3086
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:37,210
He gave the monkey...

3087
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:39,250
That's a crime.

3088
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:43,550
I don't think you're allowed to do that.

3089
02:14:43,550 --> 02:14:43,690
What?

3090
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:53,320
That's crazy.

3091
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:54,960
Okay, that's crazy.

3092
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:56,640
That's actually crazy.

3093
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:02,860
Send him to monkey jail.

3094
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:08,060
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to give the monkey bubble tea.

3095
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:10,600
I'm fucking pretty sure.

3096
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:13,680
What is this monkey doing with a cool kid?

3097
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:20,860
What is this?

3098
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:22,580
What is this?

3099
02:15:25,770 --> 02:15:25,950
God.

3100
02:15:31,370 --> 02:15:33,350
They're out of control.

3101
02:15:35,310 --> 02:15:36,830
Oh, look at the monkey.

3102
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:39,790
Oh my god.

3103
02:15:39,830 --> 02:15:41,550
There's so many monkeys.

3104
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,980
Look at the monkeys.

3105
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:51,560
Look at the monkeys.

3106
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:51,700
Look at the monkeys.

3107
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:55,080
Look at them.

3108
02:15:55,300 --> 02:15:55,820
Yeah, they're literally...

3109
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:57,420
This is where I would drive past.

3110
02:15:57,540 --> 02:15:57,980
Right here.

3111
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:02,160
I would be in my car or my taxi.

3112
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:04,220
Like my red cab.

3113
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:06,040
And then I'd see all these monkeys.

3114
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:19,300
And then they'd all be in this parking lot too.

3115
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:26,650
You're in the wrong neighborhood.

3116
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:28,750
Welcome to Monkey Mountain.

3117
02:16:30,990 --> 02:16:32,470
You're so cute.

3118
02:16:33,530 --> 02:16:35,050
Look at all these monkeys.

3119
02:16:36,990 --> 02:16:38,910
So many monkeys.

3120
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:52,770
One at a time, monkey.

3121
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:54,950
One at a time.

3122
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:55,150
One at a time.

3123
02:17:01,110 --> 02:17:02,170
Oh my god.

3124
02:17:03,390 --> 02:17:04,190
Just kidding.

3125
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:06,950
This is where I want to go too.

3126
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:08,190
I want to go to Monkey Mountain.

3127
02:17:09,130 --> 02:17:10,390
This is like...

3128
02:17:10,390 --> 02:17:12,550
Something I've wanted to go for the longest time.

3129
02:17:14,930 --> 02:17:15,330
Alright.

3130
02:17:16,110 --> 02:17:17,490
What else do we want to do?

3131
02:17:17,690 --> 02:17:18,050
Oh wait.

3132
02:17:18,150 --> 02:17:20,170
Are there maid cafes in Hong Kong?

3133
02:17:20,170 --> 02:17:21,970
I know there's a cat cafe.

3134
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:24,030
I went to a cat cafe with my dad.

3135
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:25,590
But...

3136
02:17:25,590 --> 02:17:26,850
Is there maid...

3137
02:17:26,850 --> 02:17:28,470
Is there one in Hong Kong?

3138
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:30,290
Is there any...

3139
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:31,330
Oh my god.

3140
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:31,670
Wait.

3141
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:32,430
Let's see.

3142
02:17:34,630 --> 02:17:35,190
Explore...

3143
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:35,530
Wait.

3144
02:17:35,670 --> 02:17:36,410
Oh there is!

3145
02:17:39,930 --> 02:17:40,910
I know there is a...

3146
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:41,710
Cat cafes.

3147
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:43,250
I've never been to...

3148
02:17:43,250 --> 02:17:44,310
I've been to the...

3149
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:46,470
The cat cafes there.

3150
02:17:47,370 --> 02:17:48,050
What is this?

3151
02:17:48,190 --> 02:17:48,990
Dreamy home?

3152
02:17:49,650 --> 02:17:50,670
What is this?

3153
02:17:50,870 --> 02:17:52,050
I'm gonna mute this real quick.

3154
02:17:58,640 --> 02:17:59,480
Oh there is...

3155
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:00,860
There's like little small ones.

3156
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:01,180
Yeah.

3157
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:03,100
There's like little tiny...

3158
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:04,260
The small ones around.

3159
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:05,900
Oh there's no like...

3160
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:06,960
Like um...

3161
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:07,960
Like the ones you see in Japan.

3162
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:09,720
I've never been to the maid cafe in...

3163
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,260
In Hong Kong though.

3164
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:12,480
Wait.

3165
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:13,340
Maid Planet?

3166
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:18,630
Oh!

3167
02:18:18,650 --> 02:18:20,890
There's like an atom in maid cafe too.

3168
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:21,490
Okay.

3169
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:22,270
What about...

3170
02:18:22,850 --> 02:18:23,490
Oh my god.

3171
02:18:23,790 --> 02:18:25,050
Do they still have the...

3172
02:18:25,050 --> 02:18:26,810
Gutama cafe in Hong Kong?

3173
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:28,210
Or is that gone?

3174
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:31,670
Oh wait.

3175
02:18:31,830 --> 02:18:33,090
Is that...

3176
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:34,530
Oh...

3177
02:18:35,990 --> 02:18:36,870
Oh my god.

3178
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:38,550
This was nine years ago.

3179
02:18:39,130 --> 02:18:39,530
Okay.

3180
02:18:41,330 --> 02:18:42,790
I went to a...

3181
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:43,080
I love...

3182
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:44,750
Okay.

3183
02:18:44,930 --> 02:18:46,290
There was a...

3184
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:47,070
This is one...

3185
02:18:47,070 --> 02:18:48,450
I don't know if this is the same one.

3186
02:18:49,210 --> 02:18:49,790
No.

3187
02:18:49,890 --> 02:18:50,490
It can't be.

3188
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:51,690
But this is a...

3189
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:53,570
This is a...

3190
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:54,870
This is a Gutama...

3191
02:18:55,490 --> 02:18:57,830
A Gutama cafe in Hong Kong.

3192
02:19:00,470 --> 02:19:02,850
Please don't go to dreamy home.

3193
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:04,670
I don't know what that is.

3194
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:05,450
I...

3195
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:09,030
Oh my god.

3196
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:09,630
Look at that.

3197
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:10,450
Look at that.

3198
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:11,940
And he has a little bite.

3199
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:14,010
And he has a little bite.

3200
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:15,510
Oh!

3201
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:27,080
Yeah!

3202
02:19:27,460 --> 02:19:27,680
No!

3203
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,460
No!

3204
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:47,460
They...

3205
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:48,640
They win!

3206
02:19:57,230 --> 02:20:01,490
I am so happy.

3207
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:03,010
It was the...

3208
02:20:03,010 --> 02:20:05,770
That was the core character.

3209
02:20:06,770 --> 02:20:08,950
They don't know.

3210
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:15,510
They deserve that.

3211
02:20:16,290 --> 02:20:17,970
Oh my god.

3212
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:19,870
The monster.

3213
02:20:20,850 --> 02:20:22,410
The monster.

3214
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:29,950
Like, someone said I didn't, I wouldn't see it.

3215
02:20:30,090 --> 02:20:36,150
And if I had to see it, if I had to suffer, I want everyone to suffer.

3216
02:20:36,450 --> 02:20:40,410
I want everyone to suffer, too.

3217
02:20:46,410 --> 02:20:50,450
I refuse to be the only one that saw this.

3218
02:20:52,410 --> 02:20:54,250
That demon!

3219
02:20:55,230 --> 02:20:58,490
I couldn't do this!

3220
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:00,570
I could die!

3221
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:12,890
I got an unexpected trauma.

3222
02:21:13,450 --> 02:21:15,750
I'll never be the same.

3223
02:21:19,570 --> 02:21:22,830
Alright, what else do I want to do when I'm there?

3224
02:21:23,970 --> 02:21:31,090
Hmm, oh my god, Kevin last night, that, apparently that, uh, the, the, it's like a pop-up cafe?

3225
02:21:31,090 --> 02:21:32,390
That sucks.

3226
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:38,130
The, like, Utama stuff in Hong Kong are, like, pop-up cafes, but they're all so cute, though.

3227
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:42,490
Which makes me sad, cuz I went to one, I, I went to one before, too.

3228
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:44,210
Alright, what else?

3229
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:45,930
What else is there to do, guys?

3230
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:48,110
What else did I do when I'm there?

3231
02:21:48,970 --> 02:21:52,550
No, I, I'm never again.

3232
02:21:52,690 --> 02:21:53,750
I can't do hiking, guys.

3233
02:21:54,030 --> 02:21:54,830
I can't.

3234
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:56,570
I'll, I'll be, go, I'll go missing.

3235
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:02,550
I'll be, I'll, I won't return.

3236
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:02,690
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I won't burn.

3237
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:10,450
It's not a good idea!

3238
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:14,370
Oh, there's a musicfest?

3239
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:16,070
What's it called?

3240
02:22:17,310 --> 02:22:26,050
Oh, clock and flap, the lineup, oh, I don't know.

3241
02:22:26,230 --> 02:22:28,550
I'm not really a fan of music festivals to be fair.

3242
02:22:28,550 --> 02:22:32,110
It's just too many people in general.

3243
02:22:33,330 --> 02:22:36,390
I like looking from afar.

3244
02:22:37,970 --> 02:22:48,390
It's like because it reminds me of when I did like New Year Countdown in Hong Kong and there's so many people.

3245
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:50,790
There's so many people.

3246
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:56,550
And it was like... I felt like very claustrophobic there for like the New Year Countdown.

3247
02:22:57,190 --> 02:22:58,370
Thank you to the super chat.

3248
02:22:58,510 --> 02:22:58,710
Thank you.

3249
02:22:58,890 --> 02:22:59,390
Thank you.

3250
02:22:59,630 --> 02:23:01,350
And yeah, you want to go to see them.

3251
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:02,230
But that's different.

3252
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:03,330
That's different.

3253
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:05,630
Let's see.

3254
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:20,870
What else?

3255
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:21,310
What else?

3256
02:23:21,510 --> 02:23:21,730
What else?

3257
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:22,910
What do you need to do?

3258
02:23:26,550 --> 02:23:27,390
Oh my gosh.

3259
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:27,790
Okay.

3260
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:28,790
What is it called?

3261
02:23:29,110 --> 02:23:30,830
USA Gym?

3262
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:34,210
Is that what it's called?

3263
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:37,450
Jumping Gym USA?

3264
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I'm too... I'm too old for this.

3265
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:45,400
But this was my childhood too.

3266
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:49,400
Jumping Gym USA.

3267
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:58,200
It was like... It was literally... It's like a... It's like an arcade, but for children.

3268
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:02,920
But you'll also see grannies there playing the coin games.

3269
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:12,320
You'll see... You'll see like all the grannies and stuff just sitting around the coin game...

3270
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:13,480
The coin pusher games.

3271
02:24:13,720 --> 02:24:18,580
Because for them that was like... I guess like... Because it's like legal gambling type deal.

3272
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:25,480
So... You'll see like all the grannies just doing the... Doing the little coin pushers.

3273
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:30,220
And then like winning them for like... Winning like the mini prizes and stuff.

3274
02:24:30,620 --> 02:24:31,420
For like...

3275
02:24:31,420 --> 02:24:36,180
Because you can win like actual... You can win like actual...

3276
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:38,240
Actual prizes.

3277
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:42,420
Because my grandma went to Jumping Gym USA.

3278
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:43,900
Which is like an arcade.

3279
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:47,380
And like... She... She won something there.

3280
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:49,420
And then she got a fucking rice cooker.

3281
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:52,900
And then I was with my grandma.

3282
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:56,230
I was like... Oh my god you won it!

3283
02:24:56,590 --> 02:24:58,350
And then she got the rice cooker.

3284
02:24:58,770 --> 02:24:59,750
And then...

3285
02:25:01,790 --> 02:25:06,090
So I was... I was like... Oh... Can I get the big pesky grandma?

3286
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:08,030
And she's like... No, no, no.

3287
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:09,750
You get something useful.

3288
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:15,570
We get you something useful.

3289
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,950
And then she got us the rice cooker.

3290
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:22,570
And it was... It was that coin toss game.

3291
02:25:22,570 --> 02:25:23,930
It's a coin toss game.

3292
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:25,690
It's not the rainbow one.

3293
02:25:25,850 --> 02:25:27,970
So there's several games where you toss a coin.

3294
02:25:28,670 --> 02:25:31,230
And... Um... It has to land on a spot.

3295
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:32,430
So they have one with a rainbow.

3296
02:25:32,430 --> 02:25:34,950
But it was basically a coin toss game.

3297
02:25:35,070 --> 02:25:37,170
And there was a tiny square in the middle.

3298
02:25:37,390 --> 02:25:39,870
And my grandma landed it in the middle.

3299
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:42,250
And she fucking picked a rice cooker.

3300
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:45,050
And she fucking picked a rice cooker.

3301
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:49,310
So...

3302
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:52,550
This is Jumping Gym USA.

3303
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:58,110
Okay, we're no need to listen to them.

3304
02:25:58,270 --> 02:25:59,930
We just want to experience it.

3305
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:01,630
Because we can make our own comments.

3306
02:26:01,790 --> 02:26:01,950
See, look.

3307
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:02,830
So these are like...

3308
02:26:02,830 --> 02:26:04,730
These are the... These are the prizes.

3309
02:26:05,050 --> 02:26:07,130
They're gonna show you the prizes real quick.

3310
02:26:07,850 --> 02:26:08,290
And...

3311
02:26:08,290 --> 02:26:10,090
This is the generational beef.

3312
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:12,570
So there's the cheap ones, right?

3313
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:15,550
And then you turn to the right.

3314
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:17,170
And then these are like...

3315
02:26:17,730 --> 02:26:19,010
The practical...

3316
02:26:19,590 --> 02:26:20,570
I mean, not practical.

3317
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:22,590
These are like still the cheap ones still.

3318
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:23,330
Don't worry.

3319
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:24,570
When they turn to the left.

3320
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:26,550
That's where the real prizes are.

3321
02:26:29,710 --> 02:26:31,670
That's when we get to the appliances.

3322
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:33,190
There we go!

3323
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:34,810
There we go!

3324
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:36,170
The appliances!

3325
02:26:36,630 --> 02:26:36,870
Yeah!

3326
02:26:40,110 --> 02:26:42,070
That's what I'm talking about!

3327
02:26:44,450 --> 02:26:45,790
That's where you get...

3328
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:47,430
Oh, this has to be a newer one.

3329
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:48,610
There's like...

3330
02:26:48,610 --> 02:26:49,870
Okay, so I want...

3331
02:26:49,870 --> 02:26:50,750
These are the newer ones.

3332
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:51,330
Because...

3333
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:53,770
They didn't have all these cranes though.

3334
02:26:53,930 --> 02:26:54,450
Back then.

3335
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:56,610
Yeah, this is a newer one.

3336
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:57,870
Jumping Gym USA.

3337
02:26:58,750 --> 02:26:59,830
Because I've never seen...

3338
02:26:59,830 --> 02:27:00,810
Okay, this is...

3339
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:02,130
That's what I've seen a lot.

3340
02:27:02,610 --> 02:27:03,090
But...

3341
02:27:03,090 --> 02:27:04,530
The old ones...

3342
02:27:04,530 --> 02:27:05,170
Were like...

3343
02:27:05,170 --> 02:27:05,910
A lot different.

3344
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:09,350
Oh my god!

3345
02:27:09,510 --> 02:27:10,330
Yeah, these are new.

3346
02:27:10,890 --> 02:27:12,930
I had a membership card, by the way.

3347
02:27:13,150 --> 02:27:14,610
I had a fucking membership card.

3348
02:27:14,610 --> 02:27:16,550
I was dedicated to the arcade life.

3349
02:27:16,750 --> 02:27:17,410
Let's see...

3350
02:27:17,410 --> 02:27:18,330
Maybe it's this one?

3351
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:20,790
I wanna go to like an older one.

3352
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:23,290
Yeah, I was like...

3353
02:27:23,290 --> 02:27:23,950
These are...

3354
02:27:23,950 --> 02:27:25,090
These are...

3355
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:25,550
These...

3356
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:27,350
The ones that that person went to...

3357
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:27,850
Is like...

3358
02:27:27,850 --> 02:27:28,830
The newer ones.

3359
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:30,370
Because the older ones are like...

3360
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:31,190
A lot different.

3361
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:32,210
I was like...

3362
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:33,610
Where are my coin pushers?

3363
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:35,010
Where are my grannies...

3364
02:27:35,010 --> 02:27:36,650
Sitting at the coin pusher machines?

3365
02:27:37,170 --> 02:27:38,190
Where are they?

3366
02:27:38,890 --> 02:27:40,050
There's so many...

3367
02:27:40,050 --> 02:27:40,590
Like...

3368
02:27:40,590 --> 02:27:42,310
There's so many crane games now.

3369
02:27:42,310 --> 02:27:44,510
There was not a lot of crane games back then.

3370
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:45,990
When...

3371
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:46,890
When I was there.

3372
02:27:47,730 --> 02:27:48,350
Oh my god!

3373
02:27:48,450 --> 02:27:49,170
Everyone's just doing the...

3374
02:27:49,170 --> 02:27:50,510
I don't wanna see the crane games!

3375
02:27:50,730 --> 02:27:51,630
Oh my god!

3376
02:27:53,730 --> 02:27:55,470
Stop showing me the crane games!

3377
02:27:56,810 --> 02:27:58,030
That's not my...

3378
02:27:58,030 --> 02:27:59,450
My authentic experience.

3379
02:28:02,470 --> 02:28:03,170
Oh my god!

3380
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:04,510
It's literally all crane games.

3381
02:28:05,010 --> 02:28:05,410
It's...

3382
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:07,050
That's how you know.

3383
02:28:07,390 --> 02:28:09,450
So many crane games.

3384
02:28:09,650 --> 02:28:10,670
What the fuck?

3385
02:28:10,670 --> 02:28:13,810
All I did there was coin pushers and...

3386
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:14,730
And...

3387
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:15,230
And...

3388
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:16,990
Throwing the coins at the fucking rainbow.

3389
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:18,390
Where's my...

3390
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:20,130
Where's my rainbow toss?

3391
02:28:23,370 --> 02:28:24,270
I'm angry.

3392
02:28:24,410 --> 02:28:24,950
Oh, there it is.

3393
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:25,230
Okay.

3394
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:26,250
This is what I would...

3395
02:28:26,250 --> 02:28:28,410
This is what I spent most of my coins in.

3396
02:28:28,570 --> 02:28:29,010
Right here.

3397
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:30,190
Right...

3398
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:30,330
Okay.

3399
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:30,850
Don't worry.

3400
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:32,030
You'll see it soon.

3401
02:28:32,830 --> 02:28:33,430
This is...

3402
02:28:34,390 --> 02:28:35,510
This right here.

3403
02:28:35,770 --> 02:28:36,410
This is...

3404
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:38,390
This right here.

3405
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:41,490
The whole majority of my coins.

3406
02:28:41,910 --> 02:28:42,550
And...

3407
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:44,570
You toss your coin.

3408
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:47,270
And it blasts and land on the rainbow.

3409
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:48,170
And...

3410
02:28:49,890 --> 02:28:51,810
That's my favorite game.

3411
02:28:52,210 --> 02:28:53,450
That's all that you see.

3412
02:28:53,710 --> 02:28:54,830
But right here.

3413
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:56,210
This was...

3414
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:57,450
Peak Arcade.

3415
02:28:57,910 --> 02:28:58,530
The coin...

3416
02:28:58,950 --> 02:28:59,510
The grind.

3417
02:28:59,650 --> 02:29:01,250
This is where I was stuck in.

3418
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:03,750
This was where I grinded my plushies.

3419
02:29:03,750 --> 02:29:07,370
I literally threw coins until I hit the rainbow.

3420
02:29:12,450 --> 02:29:13,710
This is it.

3421
02:29:14,250 --> 02:29:16,550
This simulates my brain.

3422
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:19,250
This is where I would do.

3423
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:20,550
Where like...

3424
02:29:20,550 --> 02:29:22,550
My parents would abandon me in...

3425
02:29:22,550 --> 02:29:23,370
In this area.

3426
02:29:23,370 --> 02:29:24,750
Cause I had my own card.

3427
02:29:26,010 --> 02:29:26,690
Um...

3428
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:27,410
If like...

3429
02:29:27,410 --> 02:29:28,370
They were going shopping.

3430
02:29:28,710 --> 02:29:29,350
And the...

3431
02:29:29,350 --> 02:29:30,570
If we're at a mall...

3432
02:29:31,450 --> 02:29:32,130
Um...

3433
02:29:32,130 --> 02:29:34,090
If we're at a mall...

3434
02:29:34,090 --> 02:29:34,870
And like...

3435
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:36,470
They had a jumping gym USA.

3436
02:29:36,990 --> 02:29:38,630
My parents would abandon me.

3437
02:29:39,430 --> 02:29:40,450
I would...

3438
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:41,810
They would...

3439
02:29:41,810 --> 02:29:43,150
Abandon me here.

3440
02:29:43,410 --> 02:29:44,050
And...

3441
02:29:44,050 --> 02:29:45,250
This was my daycare.

3442
02:29:46,810 --> 02:29:47,150
My...

3443
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:48,990
My daycare.

3444
02:29:49,290 --> 02:29:50,950
And I spent most of it...

3445
02:29:50,950 --> 02:29:54,010
I spent most of it on the rainbow coin toss.

3446
02:29:55,230 --> 02:29:55,910
Uh...

3447
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:59,490
And then they'll come back for me.

3448
02:30:00,270 --> 02:30:00,950
Um...

3449
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:04,850
My daycare was this arcade.

3450
02:30:05,150 --> 02:30:08,530
With things to do in Hong Kong.

3451
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:09,990
Yeah.

3452
02:30:10,210 --> 02:30:11,790
Cause I had my own like...

3453
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:13,310
Membership card too.

3454
02:30:13,870 --> 02:30:14,110
Uh...

3455
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:14,650
Cause they had...

3456
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:15,750
They used to have a mascot.

3457
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:16,630
And they were like...

3458
02:30:16,630 --> 02:30:16,810
The...

3459
02:30:16,810 --> 02:30:17,850
The Onis.

3460
02:30:18,130 --> 02:30:19,810
The red and blue Onis.

3461
02:30:19,810 --> 02:30:20,490
I think it was like...

3462
02:30:20,490 --> 02:30:22,330
The red and blue Onis or whatever.

3463
02:30:22,690 --> 02:30:23,870
And then like...

3464
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:24,890
I think that's what they are.

3465
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:26,210
I'm like...

3466
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:27,570
Vague memories of it right now.

3467
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:28,290
And like...

3468
02:30:28,290 --> 02:30:29,450
And I had a membership card.

3469
02:30:29,550 --> 02:30:31,370
And had so much fucking points in it.

3470
02:30:31,470 --> 02:30:32,610
And I never cashed out.

3471
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:33,550
I...

3472
02:30:33,550 --> 02:30:34,710
Cause they expired too.

3473
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:35,550
That was the worst part.

3474
02:30:35,610 --> 02:30:36,470
I kept hoarding them.

3475
02:30:36,630 --> 02:30:38,650
And then I hoarded them into expiring.

3476
02:30:38,850 --> 02:30:40,470
And I kept hoarding it again.

3477
02:30:40,710 --> 02:30:42,370
And then they'll expire again.

3478
02:30:42,370 --> 02:30:43,550
And I never cashed out.

3479
02:30:43,710 --> 02:30:46,490
I never cashed out all my points.

3480
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:53,050
It was a very, very, very bad cycle.

3481
02:30:53,890 --> 02:30:55,030
What else to do?

3482
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:56,690
I never learned.

3483
02:30:56,850 --> 02:30:57,890
I just kept hoarding it.

3484
02:30:58,710 --> 02:31:00,230
I just never learned.

3485
02:31:02,870 --> 02:31:04,170
All I did...

3486
02:31:04,170 --> 02:31:05,970
I kept thinking it would be different.

3487
02:31:06,490 --> 02:31:07,730
But I was wrong.

3488
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:09,490
It was never different.

3489
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,630
Oh yeah.

3490
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:14,010
Since we're gonna be watching...

3491
02:31:14,010 --> 02:31:14,810
Since we're watching videos.

3492
02:31:14,970 --> 02:31:15,770
I wanted to show you guys.

3493
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:16,150
I don't know.

3494
02:31:16,310 --> 02:31:17,790
I must have shown you guys already, right?

3495
02:31:18,250 --> 02:31:20,090
The new Jurassic Park ride in...

3496
02:31:20,090 --> 02:31:21,110
Shanghai Disneyland.

3497
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:22,270
Oh wait.

3498
02:31:22,270 --> 02:31:22,350
No.

3499
02:31:22,430 --> 02:31:22,590
Sorry.

3500
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:22,850
Not Shanghai.

3501
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:24,710
Universal Studios in Beijing.

3502
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:28,310
Jurassic Park owned by Disney.

3503
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:29,270
By the way.

3504
02:31:29,470 --> 02:31:29,650
Sorry.

3505
02:31:29,770 --> 02:31:31,790
I meant Universal...

3506
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:32,430
Beijing.

3507
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:34,350
That ride is so scary.

3508
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:35,870
Like I feel...

3509
02:31:35,870 --> 02:31:36,350
I don't know.

3510
02:31:36,470 --> 02:31:38,410
That ride is actually so fucking crazy.

3511
02:31:39,790 --> 02:31:40,590
Close in.

3512
02:31:41,090 --> 02:31:41,190
No.

3513
02:31:41,690 --> 02:31:43,090
For those who've never seen it.

3514
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:43,690
So like...

3515
02:31:43,690 --> 02:31:44,470
So like...

3516
02:31:44,470 --> 02:31:45,750
This ride is like...

3517
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:46,690
Different from...

3518
02:31:48,490 --> 02:31:49,370
It's like...

3519
02:31:49,370 --> 02:31:50,650
Different from...

3520
02:31:50,650 --> 02:31:51,830
Holy shit.

3521
02:31:51,870 --> 02:31:52,510
That scared me.

3522
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:54,010
Oh my god.

3523
02:31:54,230 --> 02:31:54,810
Cause it was like...

3524
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:55,670
Why is it so quiet?

3525
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:01,090
Okay.

3526
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:02,450
But like...

3527
02:32:02,450 --> 02:32:02,870
Um...

3528
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:03,270
Yeah, I know.

3529
02:32:03,390 --> 02:32:04,570
That scared me too guys.

3530
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:05,070
Don't worry.

3531
02:32:05,270 --> 02:32:05,670
I was like...

3532
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:06,470
Why is it not...

3533
02:32:06,470 --> 02:32:07,610
Why is there no sound?

3534
02:32:07,770 --> 02:32:07,970
Okay.

3535
02:32:08,110 --> 02:32:10,010
So what makes this ride...

3536
02:32:10,610 --> 02:32:11,010
Different...

3537
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:12,250
Is that...

3538
02:32:12,250 --> 02:32:13,250
Look at this animatronic.

3539
02:32:13,490 --> 02:32:13,990
It's crazy.

3540
02:32:16,390 --> 02:32:18,830
This animatronic is actually crazy.

3541
02:32:19,630 --> 02:32:21,270
It's so close to...

3542
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:22,690
It's so fucking close to you.

3543
02:32:23,230 --> 02:32:24,030
And like...

3544
02:32:24,030 --> 02:32:24,310
No, no.

3545
02:32:24,430 --> 02:32:24,970
This is like...

3546
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:27,490
This is only in Beijing Universal Studios.

3547
02:32:28,610 --> 02:32:29,630
And then like...

3548
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:30,070
Watch, watch.

3549
02:32:30,390 --> 02:32:31,510
It gets crazier.

3550
02:32:33,250 --> 02:32:35,490
So you're being chased by...

3551
02:32:35,490 --> 02:32:36,050
The Indom...

3552
02:32:36,050 --> 02:32:37,050
What is his name called?

3553
02:32:37,210 --> 02:32:37,770
Something's...

3554
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:38,710
Indominate Rex?

3555
02:32:38,710 --> 02:32:39,510
Or some shit?

3556
02:32:42,590 --> 02:32:44,390
No, it gets a lot crazier.

3557
02:32:45,450 --> 02:32:46,430
It's so scary.

3558
02:32:47,630 --> 02:32:48,070
Like...

3559
02:32:48,070 --> 02:32:49,450
I don't think I could actually ride this.

3560
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:50,790
I closed my eyes...

3561
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:52,910
When I was riding the mummy in...

3562
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:53,270
Uh...

3563
02:32:53,270 --> 02:32:55,150
The Universal Studios in the US.

3564
02:32:56,470 --> 02:32:56,910
Like...

3565
02:32:56,910 --> 02:32:58,170
I closed my eyes...

3566
02:32:58,590 --> 02:32:59,070
On that.

3567
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:00,770
I closed my eyes for that ride...

3568
02:33:00,770 --> 02:33:01,990
And like...

3569
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,170
Um...

3570
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:03,990
And...

3571
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:05,530
The Jurassic Park one.

3572
02:33:06,430 --> 02:33:08,570
And also the Harry Potter one too.

3573
02:33:09,630 --> 02:33:10,150
Like...

3574
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:12,030
I was riding it with one of my friends.

3575
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:13,890
And my friend like...

3576
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:14,510
Kept like...

3577
02:33:14,510 --> 02:33:15,530
Slapping my legs.

3578
02:33:15,570 --> 02:33:15,890
Like...

3579
02:33:15,890 --> 02:33:16,330
Open your eyes!

3580
02:33:16,490 --> 02:33:17,010
Open your eyes!

3581
02:33:17,190 --> 02:33:18,470
During the Harry Potter one.

3582
02:33:18,730 --> 02:33:19,590
And I like...

3583
02:33:19,590 --> 02:33:20,390
I was like...

3584
02:33:20,390 --> 02:33:20,650
No!

3585
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:25,790
It's like...

3586
02:33:25,790 --> 02:33:26,650
And then like...

3587
02:33:26,650 --> 02:33:28,450
The moment I opened my eyes...

3588
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:29,350
Okay, this is...

3589
02:33:29,350 --> 02:33:29,970
Oh wait, this is here.

3590
02:33:30,310 --> 02:33:31,370
This is the freaky part.

3591
02:33:31,570 --> 02:33:32,050
It...

3592
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:32,950
Chases you.

3593
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:35,210
It actually chases you.

3594
02:33:35,470 --> 02:33:37,810
That shit is so scary!

3595
02:33:37,810 --> 02:33:39,290
You like...

3596
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:39,910
Look at it!

3597
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:41,430
And it chases you!

3598
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:43,910
While you're fucking riding it!

3599
02:33:45,850 --> 02:33:46,490
Like...

3600
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:51,270
And then the one time I opened my eyes...

3601
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:53,570
Um...

3602
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:55,650
The one time I opened my eyes...

3603
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:56,630
It was when...

3604
02:33:56,630 --> 02:33:57,410
It was the...

3605
02:33:57,410 --> 02:33:58,890
The dragon part...

3606
02:33:58,890 --> 02:33:59,270
And like...

3607
02:33:59,270 --> 02:34:00,370
Where he like opened...

3608
02:34:00,370 --> 02:34:01,710
Like he was right in your face...

3609
02:34:01,710 --> 02:34:03,050
And breathing fire at you...

3610
02:34:03,050 --> 02:34:03,890
And like...

3611
02:34:03,890 --> 02:34:04,950
And I was just like...

3612
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:05,150
How...

3613
02:34:05,150 --> 02:34:07,550
Why did you tell me to open my eyes?

3614
02:34:08,090 --> 02:34:08,450
What?

3615
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:15,710
What?

3616
02:34:16,090 --> 02:34:16,110
What?

3617
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:16,190
I thought that was...

3618
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:16,350
That...

3619
02:34:16,350 --> 02:34:17,490
I thought that was...

3620
02:34:17,490 --> 02:34:18,330
Really good.

3621
02:34:19,070 --> 02:34:19,510
What?

3622
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:20,330
Oh my god!

3623
02:34:21,690 --> 02:34:22,790
Chinese Chris Pratt!

3624
02:34:22,910 --> 02:34:23,770
He can do anything.

3625
02:34:28,410 --> 02:34:29,610
Oh my god.

3626
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:32,850
He is so talented.

3627
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,960
He's so talented.

3628
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:41,760
He really is in everything.

3629
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:49,580
But yeah, no, I thought the...

3630
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:56,020
But yeah, I won't spoil you guys this, but this part is actually the scariest for me.

3631
02:34:56,020 --> 02:34:56,740
This part?

3632
02:34:57,220 --> 02:35:00,060
Where it, like, comes after you and everything?

3633
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,400
That shit is crazy.

3634
02:35:04,760 --> 02:35:07,640
And that... that red is freaking crazy.

3635
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:08,520
Yeah.

3636
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:11,280
That's so cool.

3637
02:35:11,380 --> 02:35:11,620
I know.

3638
02:35:11,740 --> 02:35:14,680
It's pretty cool, but that also scares me a lot.

3639
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:18,920
Oh, just received an email from Grissmire.

3640
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:19,980
Yay!

3641
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:21,340
I'm happy.

3642
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:21,980
I'm happy.

3643
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:24,120
It's gonna be shifted soon.

3644
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:26,300
Uh, Sushi, thank you for the super chat.

3645
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:26,640
Thank you.

3646
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,260
Thank you.

3647
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:30,420
Uh, let's see.

3648
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:31,740
What else to do?

3649
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:33,300
10 places to visit.

3650
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:35,380
Okay, there is, like... okay.

3651
02:35:38,060 --> 02:35:40,940
There is, like, several malls I want to go to, though.

3652
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:42,380
That I missed.

3653
02:35:43,140 --> 02:35:43,280
Uh.

3654
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:45,820
Alright.

3655
02:35:46,700 --> 02:35:47,540
Let's see.

3656
02:35:48,060 --> 02:35:49,020
Harbor City.

3657
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:50,020
Oh my god.

3658
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:58,040
Harbor City is so fun to explore.

3659
02:35:58,280 --> 02:35:59,740
I love going around Harbor City.

3660
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:03,660
Because, like, it's such, like, there's so many things you can do.

3661
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:04,820
I like Harbor City.

3662
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:06,020
Um.

3663
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:06,900
I don't know.

3664
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:08,080
I actually like Harbor City.

3665
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:10,160
I, I, I, I, I, I like Harbor City.

3666
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:11,160
I know some people are like, eh.

3667
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:17,640
Um, but I like Harbor City because there's always, like, a lot of places to explore in Harbor City.

3668
02:36:17,740 --> 02:36:20,840
And they have really nice decorations and stuff there.

3669
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:25,980
And, like, I always like seeing, like, the mall, the new shops that are here, there.

3670
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:26,860
Yeah.

3671
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:28,860
It's a really nice mall, Harbor City.

3672
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:31,360
It's so pretty, too.

3673
02:36:35,050 --> 02:36:35,950
What about this?

3674
02:36:36,050 --> 02:36:36,550
I Square.

3675
02:36:37,550 --> 02:36:38,670
I know I Square.

3676
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:42,010
Oh, yeah, I know I Square because I know this place.

3677
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:44,270
I remember this place.

3678
02:36:44,750 --> 02:36:46,830
This place is, you see this area everywhere.

3679
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:53,350
Is it kind of dead now?

3680
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:54,490
Wait, why is it dead?

3681
02:36:54,770 --> 02:36:56,670
I've been to I Square a lot back then.

3682
02:36:59,270 --> 02:37:01,570
I only go to Harbor City in the years.

3683
02:37:01,750 --> 02:37:03,310
Okay, Harbor City has really good air con.

3684
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:04,470
Yeah, I know.

3685
02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:05,670
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

3686
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:11,180
I have C.

3687
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:15,980
Central, the two international finance towers cast their long shadows...

3688
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,360
Oh, my God, I have C.

3689
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:17,660
Ma.

3690
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:20,120
...street brands to choose from, including Celine.

3691
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:21,560
If you look charming...

3692
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:22,300
Oh, my God.

3693
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,720
Is this person, like, okay?

3694
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:27,200
Like, what is this...

3695
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:33,040
What is this recording footage?

3696
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:36,540
Is he, like, having a stroke while recording this?

3697
02:37:36,540 --> 02:37:39,340
Like, like, everything else was okay.

3698
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:42,600
Camera man is shaking.

3699
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,760
Oh, there's Causeway Bay, Ma.

3700
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:46,760
Like, this is all right.

3701
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:52,660
They're too excited.

3702
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:55,500
They were really excited, but I have seen Ma.

3703
02:38:00,820 --> 02:38:03,340
He's being chased right now.

3704
02:38:08,020 --> 02:38:10,720
Is page one still around, or did they go bankrupt?

3705
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:14,600
Total of 14 floors, as well as two basement levels...

3706
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:16,400
Page one was, like, the local...

3707
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:17,540
The bookstore place.

3708
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:25,960
...connecting floors that are home to 230 shops, in addition to a cinema, and an excellent selection of restaurants, cafes, and fast food eateries.

3709
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:28,240
Noooo!

3710
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:29,660
Page one is gone!

3711
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:31,200
Page one is gone!

3712
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:32,000
Awwww!

3713
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:34,020
For those who don't know, I used to...

3714
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:43,100
I went to page one a lot, back then, growing up, and my favorite thing to do at page one, because it was, like, a bookstore.

3715
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:48,200
Like, it was, like, a bookstore where you can get, like, English books and international books and everything.

3716
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:55,540
And the best part about page one, um, is that they can, like, they'll, they'll, like, bind your books for free, so...

3717
02:38:56,700 --> 02:39:01,680
They'll, like, um, they'll put, like, um...

3718
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:07,700
Like, if you buy a book, uh, they, like, um, put, like, a cup, like, uh, what's a lamp?

3719
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:09,480
They'll laminate your books for free, basically.

3720
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:10,740
Especially if it's hardcover.

3721
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,480
That was, like, the best part about page one.

3722
02:39:14,620 --> 02:39:17,440
Yeah, the, so, like, if I want to laminate my books and stuff.

3723
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:19,640
Okay, these were the malls I really wanted to go.

3724
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:29,160
Because, like, I haven't been to, like, I haven't been to, like, uh, a big-ass mall in a long time.

3725
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:31,720
Yeah.

3726
02:39:32,180 --> 02:39:33,100
Wait, that's really cool?

3727
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:34,640
Well, you can't do that anymore.

3728
02:39:34,640 --> 02:39:35,840
It's gone now.

3729
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:38,120
Page one is gone!

3730
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:44,940
I'm so sad!

3731
02:39:45,900 --> 02:39:47,900
Can't believe it's gone!

3732
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:50,680
That's a nice place.

3733
02:39:51,060 --> 02:39:52,340
Oh, I love IFC.

3734
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:54,980
IFC at Central.

3735
02:39:55,300 --> 02:39:56,700
Oh, my God, he's walking around IFC.

3736
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:01,780
Okay, let's watch him walk around.

3737
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:02,620
It's like I'm there.

3738
02:40:03,100 --> 02:40:04,860
It's a really nice mall, too.

3739
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:09,080
It's a very big and nice mall.

3740
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:12,560
Oh, my God.

3741
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:13,880
And he's not, like...

3742
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:16,060
And he's not being chased while filming it, too.

3743
02:40:17,020 --> 02:40:18,660
How fancy this mall is.

3744
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:21,820
What was that?

3745
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:24,880
What was that supermarket?

3746
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,440
That everyone would go to?

3747
02:40:27,860 --> 02:40:29,520
The fancy supermarket?

3748
02:40:30,620 --> 02:40:38,460
My mom would sometimes go to the fancy supermarket to buy the Onigiris and stuff for me.

3749
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:40,960
It's here.

3750
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:41,740
It's in IFC.

3751
02:40:42,820 --> 02:40:44,140
Is it City Super?

3752
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:46,440
Is it?

3753
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:48,280
I don't remember.

3754
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:51,540
My mom would go there to buy the Onigiris.

3755
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:55,000
It's in IFC, though.

3756
02:40:55,720 --> 02:40:56,760
Such a fancy mall.

3757
02:40:59,000 --> 02:40:59,660
Is this?

3758
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:00,400
Oh, it is.

3759
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:01,280
It is City Super.

3760
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:01,640
Yeah.

3761
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:04,400
That's also where she got her Fiji water.

3762
02:41:10,340 --> 02:41:14,420
I remember when I used to drink in Watson Sea.

3763
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:15,640
Watson Sea.

3764
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:17,360
Do they still sell that?

3765
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:19,260
Does anyone remember Watson water?

3766
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:20,860
The green bottle?

3767
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:22,300
The green water bottle?

3768
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:24,900
And then later on, my mom was like, No!

3769
02:41:25,100 --> 02:41:26,140
It's Fiji time.

3770
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,100
We are a Fiji family now.

3771
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:29,100
We are...

3772
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:31,560
Yeah.

3773
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:33,820
I used to drink...

3774
02:41:33,820 --> 02:41:35,340
I used to drink Watson Sea.

3775
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:37,160
And then my mom was like...

3776
02:41:37,160 --> 02:41:41,600
One day, my mom was like, We are a Fiji water family.

3777
02:41:46,420 --> 02:41:49,240
And then one day, we couldn't drink Watson Sea.

3778
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:57,460
And that was the day we became a Fiji water family.

3779
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:01,760
And she would buy Fiji water at City Super.

3780
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:06,560
Number one Fiji pen.

3781
02:42:07,740 --> 02:42:10,160
We're like, We can afford this now.

3782
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:13,940
And we're not a Watson Sea family anymore.

3783
02:42:16,040 --> 02:42:18,620
Because, like, my mom was like, We are...

3784
02:42:18,620 --> 02:42:20,180
We can afford Fiji water.

3785
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:21,600
And Fiji water is better.

3786
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:22,620
Meep!

3787
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:24,420
Thank you for the five gift of chips!

3788
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:24,880
Thank you!

3789
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:25,680
Thank you!

3790
02:42:34,330 --> 02:42:36,290
We went up the tax bracket.

3791
02:42:38,270 --> 02:42:40,030
I love exploring Mars.

3792
02:42:40,530 --> 02:42:41,790
It's such a fun time.

3793
02:42:41,950 --> 02:42:42,770
I just like going...

3794
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:44,890
I just like walking around Mars.

3795
02:42:47,770 --> 02:42:48,290
Yay!

3796
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:51,150
Oh my god, they have a McDonald's.

3797
02:42:52,610 --> 02:42:53,990
They have everything!

3798
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:55,150
Even a McDonald's!

3799
02:42:55,150 --> 02:42:55,990
McDonald's!

3800
02:43:05,720 --> 02:43:07,520
There's not a lot of people here.

3801
02:43:10,480 --> 02:43:12,520
I don't know if it's just like...

3802
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,840
Maybe it's the time of day?

3803
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:15,040
This was a year ago.

3804
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:20,600
Yeah, window shopping is so fun.

3805
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:21,540
Oh my god, Chanel.

3806
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,080
Oh, we are...

3807
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,540
They're at the district where it's just brands.

3808
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:30,280
They're like Celine, Louis Vuitton, Chanel.

3809
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:33,560
Wait, why is there a Shake Shack above all of that?

3810
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:38,520
There's like...

3811
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:40,740
Like, you can see all these like high-class...

3812
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,140
You can see Louis Vuitton right there.

3813
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:45,820
And then on the top floor is a Shake Shack.

3814
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:48,460
Like...

3815
02:43:49,380 --> 02:43:51,880
The Shake Shack reigns supreme.

3816
02:44:02,060 --> 02:44:04,260
Yeah, the Shake Shack is in the price here.

3817
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:05,040
It's bougie.

3818
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:05,660
It's...

3819
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:07,040
Oh, if you guys didn't know this.

3820
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:07,380
Okay.

3821
02:44:07,720 --> 02:44:08,400
Let me show you.

3822
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:08,760
Okay.

3823
02:44:09,380 --> 02:44:12,060
For those who don't know, I talked about this before.

3824
02:44:12,340 --> 02:44:13,960
But Spaghetti House...

3825
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:15,520
Is like...

3826
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:16,100
Fancy.

3827
02:44:16,540 --> 02:44:17,360
Fancy here.

3828
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:21,360
The Spaghetti House.

3829
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:23,380
Also, Pizza Hut too.

3830
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:25,240
This is like...

3831
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:31,580
Not fancy, but like you don't expect like Spaghetti House to be like a nice place to...

3832
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:31,900
Like...

3833
02:44:31,900 --> 02:44:32,740
Like a...

3834
02:44:33,860 --> 02:44:35,460
Like a nice place to eat...

3835
02:44:35,460 --> 02:44:36,740
Spaghetti House and Pizza...

3836
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:38,240
Oh, Pizza Hut in Hong Kong.

3837
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:40,280
Pizza Hut is like...

3838
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:41,840
Low-key...

3839
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:42,280
Like...

3840
02:44:42,280 --> 02:44:43,200
Upper-middle-class.

3841
02:44:46,680 --> 02:44:48,420
I wish I was joking.

3842
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:53,060
Yeah.

3843
02:44:53,400 --> 02:44:53,940
And it's like...

3844
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:55,740
The decorations are so nice.

3845
02:44:57,640 --> 02:44:58,420
Let's see.

3846
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:01,100
Let me see if I can find a video.

3847
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:03,540
Yeah.

3848
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:06,140
Pizza Hut is a sit-down restaurant in Hong Kong.

3849
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:08,360
I think it's also in like...

3850
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:09,200
In like...

3851
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:10,660
Other places in China too.

3852
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,280
I'm pretty sure.

3853
02:45:13,860 --> 02:45:15,200
I'm pretty sure.

3854
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:19,400
There we go.

3855
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:23,160
Watch this very shaky video from 16 years ago.

3856
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:25,780
To this upscale restaurant.

3857
02:45:25,980 --> 02:45:26,420
What is it?

3858
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:27,760
It's Pizza Hut.

3859
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:28,660
I'm getting

3860
02:45:37,030 --> 02:45:38,310
over a...

3861
02:45:39,150 --> 02:45:39,530
Hong Kong.

3862
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:41,710
I've been to the...

3863
02:45:41,710 --> 02:45:43,110
I know this Pizza Hut!

3864
02:45:43,410 --> 02:45:44,530
Wait a minute!

3865
02:45:44,850 --> 02:45:45,750
I know this...

3866
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:49,530
I know that exact interior design.

3867
02:45:49,530 --> 02:45:50,010
And...

3868
02:45:50,010 --> 02:45:53,510
I've actually been to that exact Pizza Hut.

3869
02:45:53,730 --> 02:45:53,990
Guys.

3870
02:45:54,430 --> 02:45:54,910
It's crazy.

3871
02:45:59,450 --> 02:46:00,430
Oh my god.

3872
02:46:00,530 --> 02:46:00,810
Right here.

3873
02:46:01,550 --> 02:46:03,070
Look at this Pizza Hut.

3874
02:46:03,290 --> 02:46:04,230
It's so fancy.

3875
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:06,630
This is a Pizza Hut, by the way.

3876
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:14,360
I remember this place.

3877
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:16,380
I need at this Pizza Hut.

3878
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:17,980
Oh my god.

3879
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:19,400
Share a slice of life.

3880
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:20,500
Pizza Hut.

3881
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:23,480
Oh.

3882
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:26,040
Look at that.

3883
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:26,620
Oh my god.

3884
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:29,540
You even see a picture of the chef from Pizza Hut.

3885
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:31,060
Oh my god.

3886
02:46:34,570 --> 02:46:35,210
Yeah.

3887
02:46:35,490 --> 02:46:35,730
It's...

3888
02:46:36,770 --> 02:46:37,410
It's...

3889
02:46:37,410 --> 02:46:38,310
It's actually...

3890
02:46:38,310 --> 02:46:39,690
It's actually really neat.

3891
02:46:39,850 --> 02:46:41,270
I thought it was really neat.

3892
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:42,170
Yeah.

3893
02:46:47,250 --> 02:46:48,230
That shit.

3894
02:46:48,670 --> 02:46:49,010
Yeah.

3895
02:46:49,310 --> 02:46:50,470
It's Mr. Pizza.

3896
02:46:50,810 --> 02:46:51,810
Oh my god.

3897
02:46:51,830 --> 02:46:53,970
It's Mr. Pizza from Pizza Hut.

3898
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:55,450
That's him.

3899
02:46:56,870 --> 02:46:59,990
But if you're going to be in Hong Kong, you got to try it out Pizza Hut, guys.

3900
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:00,950
I swear to god.

3901
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:01,410
It's...

3902
02:47:01,410 --> 02:47:01,650
It's...

3903
02:47:01,650 --> 02:47:03,050
I swear to god.

3904
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:04,970
It's like a whole new world.

3905
02:47:07,570 --> 02:47:09,550
It's John Pizza Hut.

3906
02:47:13,090 --> 02:47:13,570
Alright.

3907
02:47:13,570 --> 02:47:14,050
Let's see.

3908
02:47:16,350 --> 02:47:16,830
Wait.

3909
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:18,190
I want to see if they have this.

3910
02:47:19,030 --> 02:47:20,150
Anyone has a...

3911
02:47:20,150 --> 02:47:20,470
Oh here.

3912
02:47:21,290 --> 02:47:22,350
There's Secret Base.

3913
02:47:22,870 --> 02:47:24,270
I'll give you guys a tour.

3914
02:47:24,470 --> 02:47:25,170
For those who don't know.

3915
02:47:28,570 --> 02:47:29,810
Oh my god.

3916
02:47:29,890 --> 02:47:30,070
Really?

3917
02:47:31,690 --> 02:47:32,210
Okay.

3918
02:47:32,510 --> 02:47:34,610
You want to see something really cool?

3919
02:47:36,390 --> 02:47:37,750
Secret Base is so...

3920
02:47:37,750 --> 02:47:38,390
I've been here.

3921
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:39,090
I've been here.

3922
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:39,870
In Secret Base.

3923
02:47:42,150 --> 02:47:43,350
I love it.

3924
02:47:43,470 --> 02:47:44,450
It's so cool.

3925
02:47:46,790 --> 02:47:47,310
Yo.

3926
02:47:47,570 --> 02:47:48,470
Shout out to Ryan.

3927
02:47:50,350 --> 02:47:50,870
Hey.

3928
02:47:51,070 --> 02:47:51,550
Justin.

3929
02:47:51,550 --> 02:47:52,910
What is the darn thing?

3930
02:47:53,310 --> 02:47:57,470
Well, it's basically a massive showroom for Hot Toys.

3931
02:47:57,630 --> 02:47:58,990
It's their flagship store.

3932
02:47:59,290 --> 02:47:59,910
Now I...

3933
02:47:59,910 --> 02:48:01,090
So this is like where you get...

3934
02:48:01,090 --> 02:48:02,910
You pre-order like Hot Toys stuff too.

3935
02:48:03,230 --> 02:48:04,850
They don't actually sell much yet.

3936
02:48:05,010 --> 02:48:06,830
They do sell a couple of bits and pieces.

3937
02:48:07,090 --> 02:48:09,630
But for the most part, it's for pre-orders.

3938
02:48:09,910 --> 02:48:10,250
You come in...

3939
02:48:10,250 --> 02:48:10,310
Yeah.

3940
02:48:10,630 --> 02:48:12,910
I usually go here for pre-orders for Hot Toys.

3941
02:48:13,230 --> 02:48:14,350
You have to come in person.

3942
02:48:14,790 --> 02:48:15,610
You sign a...

3943
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:17,510
But now it's not a secret.

3944
02:48:18,050 --> 02:48:19,710
How could you say that?

3945
02:48:20,010 --> 02:48:23,990
But I know I have the Loki and one of the Ironmans.

3946
02:48:24,150 --> 02:48:25,090
But that's all I remember.

3947
02:48:28,710 --> 02:48:29,910
Yeah, it's so cool.

3948
02:48:30,270 --> 02:48:31,130
I love...

3949
02:48:31,130 --> 02:48:33,090
I love Hot Toys figure.

3950
02:48:33,450 --> 02:48:34,290
They're like a...

3951
02:48:34,290 --> 02:48:35,650
They're a Hong Kong company too.

3952
02:48:35,930 --> 02:48:37,490
But they're so detailed.

3953
02:48:37,710 --> 02:48:39,310
It's just a base now.

3954
02:48:40,710 --> 02:48:42,870
They're really, really detailed too.

3955
02:48:42,950 --> 02:48:44,310
The sculpts are crazy.

3956
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:47,230
Yeah, look at like the...

3957
02:48:47,230 --> 02:48:48,410
Like the clothes too.

3958
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:50,390
The clothes are like...

3959
02:48:51,030 --> 02:48:51,630
Extra...

3960
02:48:51,630 --> 02:48:53,450
Like they're very detailed too.

3961
02:48:53,650 --> 02:48:54,510
I still have...

3962
02:48:54,510 --> 02:48:56,110
They're somewhere in the storage somewhere.

3963
02:48:58,330 --> 02:48:59,930
They're like somewhere in storage.

3964
02:49:00,510 --> 02:49:02,430
But I find it like really interesting.

3965
02:49:05,670 --> 02:49:08,490
I use my birthday present for this.

3966
02:49:08,730 --> 02:49:09,430
For Hot Toys.

3967
02:49:09,550 --> 02:49:10,970
Because they're very expensive too.

3968
02:49:11,290 --> 02:49:13,250
When I got into Hot Toys...

3969
02:49:13,250 --> 02:49:13,530
I would...

3970
02:49:13,530 --> 02:49:14,950
My dad would be like...

3971
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:15,290
What do you want?

3972
02:49:15,390 --> 02:49:16,490
And I was like...

3973
02:49:16,490 --> 02:49:17,810
Take me to a secret place.

3974
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:27,110
Me want to go to a secret place.

3975
02:49:35,500 --> 02:49:37,040
That's where I would go to.

3976
02:49:37,220 --> 02:49:38,320
To get my...

3977
02:49:38,320 --> 02:49:40,240
To get my Hot Toys pre-order.

3978
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:44,740
Understand.

3979
02:49:45,080 --> 02:49:45,160
Yeah.

3980
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:47,140
And they're very, very expensive.

3981
02:49:47,440 --> 02:49:49,340
So I would use my birthday present.

3982
02:49:49,660 --> 02:49:52,060
My birthday present for this.

3983
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:53,240
Because like...

3984
02:49:53,240 --> 02:49:55,700
For me, when I was growing up...

3985
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:57,820
My parents didn't get me like birthday gifts.

3986
02:49:57,940 --> 02:49:58,660
They'll just be like...

3987
02:49:58,660 --> 02:49:59,420
What do you want?

3988
02:49:59,540 --> 02:50:00,340
And then I'd be like...

3989
02:50:00,340 --> 02:50:00,940
I want this.

3990
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:02,040
And then they'll like...

3991
02:50:02,040 --> 02:50:02,940
Buy it for me.

3992
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:04,400
Like either on my birthday...

3993
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:05,560
Or the day after my birthday.

3994
02:50:07,220 --> 02:50:08,200
Because they're like...

3995
02:50:08,200 --> 02:50:09,060
They were like...

3996
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:10,280
They don't trust themselves...

3997
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:11,740
On getting me on what I want.

3998
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:12,500
Like...

3999
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:13,080
On like...

4000
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:14,480
I guess like satisfying me.

4001
02:50:17,700 --> 02:50:18,620
I don't know.

4002
02:50:18,940 --> 02:50:20,380
I guess they don't trust themselves...

4003
02:50:20,380 --> 02:50:21,500
To get the gift that...

4004
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:22,600
They think I would want.

4005
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:23,880
So they're just like...

4006
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:24,740
What do you want?

4007
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:25,840
And I'd be like...

4008
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:26,440
I want this.

4009
02:50:30,900 --> 02:50:32,180
Oh, it's so cool.

4010
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:33,900
I love the Secret Bay stuff.

4011
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:36,340
Alright, this is when like...

4012
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:38,020
This is when...

4013
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:40,100
Before I collected myself.

4014
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:41,580
So you know how I...

4015
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:43,080
Oh my god, they have Pennywise now?

4016
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:44,620
Oh my god, they have John Wick.

4017
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,700
This is before like...

4018
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:47,540
When I...

4019
02:50:47,540 --> 02:50:48,080
You know...

4020
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:50,720
Spent all my money on buying merch of myself.

4021
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:53,240
Before then, I bought merch of other people.

4022
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:55,140
And now I know...

4023
02:50:55,800 --> 02:50:57,500
And now I know my true purpose.

4024
02:50:57,820 --> 02:50:58,960
Now I collect myself.

4025
02:50:59,340 --> 02:50:59,800
I...

4026
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:04,660
I collect myself now.

4027
02:51:08,820 --> 02:51:11,520
That is a true collector's way.

4028
02:51:12,480 --> 02:51:15,200
I'm a real collector now, guys.

4029
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:21,640
I was misguided.

4030
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,680
Now I find my real purpose.

4031
02:51:28,650 --> 02:51:30,610
Evolution of Ego.

4032
02:51:33,030 --> 02:51:34,150
Oh my god, wait.

4033
02:51:34,310 --> 02:51:35,190
Let me show you guys.

4034
02:51:35,470 --> 02:51:35,530
Okay.

4035
02:51:37,230 --> 02:51:37,790
Transformers.

4036
02:51:38,030 --> 02:51:39,130
Is it Hot Toys?

4037
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,520
What was the...

4038
02:51:44,600 --> 02:51:46,760
It was a Chinese company too.

4039
02:51:46,900 --> 02:51:47,880
Is it a Chinese company?

4040
02:51:49,060 --> 02:51:49,620
Starscream.

4041
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:54,380
Was it Hot Toys or...

4042
02:51:54,380 --> 02:51:54,640
No.

4043
02:51:54,640 --> 02:51:56,100
It was...

4044
02:51:58,640 --> 02:51:59,500
It was...

4045
02:51:59,500 --> 02:51:59,820
It was really old.

4046
02:51:59,820 --> 02:52:00,880
But I still have it.

4047
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:03,740
It was this one.

4048
02:52:03,880 --> 02:52:04,200
Oh my god.

4049
02:52:04,320 --> 02:52:04,400
What?

4050
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:04,760
What?

4051
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:05,280
Okay.

4052
02:52:07,020 --> 02:52:09,160
It was a chibi figure.

4053
02:52:10,020 --> 02:52:10,980
Of Starscream.

4054
02:52:11,240 --> 02:52:12,320
I saw short of it.

4055
02:52:12,500 --> 02:52:13,500
But I don't know...

4056
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:15,980
I don't know what company made it.

4057
02:52:16,140 --> 02:52:16,740
Is this one?

4058
02:52:18,920 --> 02:52:20,080
I have this.

4059
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:22,540
Wait.

4060
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:23,020
Let's see.

4061
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:25,120
Um...

4062
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:26,320
Does it say in the description?

4063
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,860
I'll lay...

4064
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:28,440
Oh.

4065
02:52:28,640 --> 02:52:29,500
It's Toy Chill.

4066
02:52:29,740 --> 02:52:30,340
It's Toy...

4067
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:30,740
What?

4068
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:33,400
Is that actually what it's called?

4069
02:52:34,360 --> 02:52:35,660
Does anyone know...

4070
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:36,460
Is it Kid's Logic?

4071
02:52:36,740 --> 02:52:37,820
Oh, it could be Kid's Logic.

4072
02:52:38,060 --> 02:52:39,160
Kid's Logic.

4073
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:41,620
Oh, it is.

4074
02:52:43,620 --> 02:52:45,360
I bought this at...

4075
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:47,680
I bought this at Anicon.

4076
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:50,560
This guy.

4077
02:52:51,780 --> 02:52:54,160
This guy was like...

4078
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:57,860
This guy made me happy.

4079
02:52:58,460 --> 02:52:59,240
Look at him.

4080
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:00,700
Look at him.

4081
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:01,380
He's so tiny.

4082
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:02,920
Look at this little chibi guy.

4083
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:05,400
He also has like lights and everything.

4084
02:53:06,560 --> 02:53:07,360
Look at that.

4085
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:10,100
It's so cool.

4086
02:53:10,400 --> 02:53:11,880
Yeah, I bought this at Anicon.

4087
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:14,500

4088
02:53:14,580 --> 02:53:15,000
Look at him.

4089
02:53:15,200 --> 02:53:15,780
He's so tiny.

4090
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:17,020
Okay, he's not that tiny.

4091
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:18,700
But like, he's so cute.

4092
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:21,100
I also have the Megatron too.

4093
02:53:21,460 --> 02:53:22,200

4094
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:23,020

4095
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:23,800
And the...

4096
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:24,740
Black Convoy.

4097
02:53:25,280 --> 02:53:26,200
Like, oh my god.

4098
02:53:26,220 --> 02:53:28,040
Look at the tiny gun he has.

4099
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:31,720
Look how tiny he is.

4100
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:32,540
It's so cute.

4101
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:34,380
Look how tiny his little gun is.

4102
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:39,660
And he like lights up too.

02:53:39,900 --> 02:53:40,580
It's so cute.

4104
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:41,960
Pew, pew, pew.

4105
02:53:44,580 --> 02:53:46,280
I want to see him light up.

4106
02:53:46,960 --> 02:53:47,600
Look at him.

4107
02:53:47,820 --> 02:53:48,580
Oh my god.

4108
02:53:48,820 --> 02:53:49,840
Look at this little guy.

4109
02:53:50,180 --> 02:53:51,460
And then his eyes...

4110
02:53:51,460 --> 02:53:52,240
I also have this.

4111
02:53:52,280 --> 02:53:53,220
And I have this too.

4112
02:53:53,460 --> 02:53:55,040
I have this one because I thought it was pretty high.

4113
02:53:55,660 --> 02:53:58,080
But little Doki thought it was pretty high.

4114
02:54:00,860 --> 02:54:03,300
It's like Optimus Prime.

4115
02:54:03,620 --> 02:54:04,660
But evil, you know?

4116
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:09,860
Whoa!

4117
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:12,060
Oh my god!

4118
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:13,880
Whoa!

4119
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:19,900
I was like...

4120
02:54:19,900 --> 02:54:22,020
Honestly, he looks really good in black.

4121
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:22,980
Not gonna lie.

4122
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Edgy Convoy.

4123
02:54:27,320 --> 02:54:28,260
I don't see.

4124
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:29,920
Look how fucking cool he looks.

4125
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:33,640
He looks so much better in black.

4126
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:35,400
Versus like red and blue.

4127
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:37,500
You know what?

4128
02:54:37,580 --> 02:54:38,840
I think I get it.

4129
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:39,340
Yeah.

4130
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:41,940
Look at him.

4131
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:43,200
Oh my god.

4132
02:54:43,520 --> 02:54:43,900
Okay, look.

4133
02:54:43,980 --> 02:54:44,820
Look at these two together.

4134
02:54:45,640 --> 02:54:46,200
And like...

4135
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:47,380
Okay, the red and blue...

4136
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:48,320
Yeah, I mean...

4137
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:48,740
Yeah, sure.

4138
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:49,280
It pops.

4139
02:54:49,460 --> 02:54:50,000
But like...

4140
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:50,880
But like...

4141
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:51,840
The black though.

4142
02:54:52,260 --> 02:54:53,340
The black though.

4143
02:54:53,400 --> 02:54:54,380
Oh my god.

4144
02:54:54,380 --> 02:54:56,600
You can tell he's a bad boy.

4145
02:55:05,730 --> 02:55:07,330
Alright, let's change topic.

4146
02:55:08,410 --> 02:55:10,690
Let's change topics here.

4147
02:55:13,510 --> 02:55:14,290
Alright.

4148
02:55:14,970 --> 02:55:18,470
Things to do in Hong Kong!

4149
02:55:19,350 --> 02:55:20,790
What other things should we do?

4150
02:55:21,450 --> 02:55:23,070
Best things to do in Hong Kong.

4151
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:29,420
Alright, let's look at actual tourist destinations here.

4152
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:30,500
Alright.

4153
02:55:31,520 --> 02:55:36,580
Depending on the day that you do decide to go up to the top of Victoria Peak on the tram...

4154
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:37,140
No, that's their head.

4155
02:55:37,480 --> 02:55:38,920
I don't want to go...

4156
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:41,620
Oh, that's cute though.

4157
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:44,220
Um...

4158
02:55:44,220 --> 02:55:44,480
Bag.

4159
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:45,960
Thank you for the super chat thing.

4160
02:55:46,060 --> 02:55:46,580
Thank you.

4161
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:47,460
There's the peak.

4162
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:48,700
And then there's the...

4163
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:50,580
Oh wait, there's Lantau Island.

4164
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:52,760
Now here we are at Lantau Island.

4165
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:54,960
One of the most famous islands in the Hong Kong...

4166
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:55,960
I know Lantau Island.

4167
02:55:55,980 --> 02:55:57,700
I've been to Lantau Island actually.

4168
02:55:58,360 --> 02:55:59,120
Fishing village.

4169
02:55:59,260 --> 02:56:01,560
This is a very old school fishing village.

4170
02:56:01,780 --> 02:56:04,620
You can feel like you're going back in time when you walk around here.

4171
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:05,880
They have some tours.

4172
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:06,260
Is it humid?

4173
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:08,360
It is very humid over there.

4174
02:56:08,700 --> 02:56:08,960
Most of Hong Kong...

4175
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:10,180
It is very humid.

4176
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:14,340
The Tai O fishing village is definitely a blast from the past.

4177
02:56:14,440 --> 02:56:14,980
If you're like...

4178
02:56:14,980 --> 02:56:18,260
If you're from NA, you'll find it really, really, really humid.

4179
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:21,120
And...

4180
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:23,420
Because like that was my first experience.

4181
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:24,540
Um...

4182
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:28,060
When I first came back to Hong Kong as a...

4183
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:29,360
When I...

4184
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:30,320
Not first.

4185
02:56:30,500 --> 02:56:32,080
When I moved...

4186
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:33,520
To Hong Kong.

4187
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:34,980
From...

4188
02:56:34,980 --> 02:56:36,240
Well, no, actually...

4189
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:37,400
Because like I had to...

4190
02:56:37,400 --> 02:56:39,660
We moved to China first.

4191
02:56:39,980 --> 02:56:41,020
Because like...

4192
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:42,220
But we have to...

4193
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:46,020
We have to like go through Hong Kong airport to go to Shenzhen.

4194
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:50,320
And like when I came from Canada to Hong Kong airport...

4195
02:56:50,320 --> 02:56:53,300
When I had to first move to Shenzhen...

4196
02:56:53,300 --> 02:56:55,460
Um, it was very humid.

4197
02:56:55,620 --> 02:57:04,820
I had trouble breathing at first because I was not used to humidity as someone that lived in Canada for like most of her life at that time.

4198
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:09,140
Yeah, you get like slammed up by the heat and humidity.

4199
02:57:14,880 --> 02:57:21,140
So if you're like, if you grew up with like Canadian type weather, it would be very humid for you.

4200
02:57:22,140 --> 02:57:30,740
So like for me, I know, I know like when I, when I get there, I'm gonna get like hit by the humidity if I go during the summer.

4201
02:57:30,820 --> 02:57:31,680
But I'm not going during the summer.

4202
02:57:31,780 --> 02:57:32,580
I'm gonna go during the winter.

4203
02:57:32,980 --> 02:57:34,740
So my body can adjust easier.

4204
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:42,040
What is this?

4205
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:49,960
Oh, wait, is that... I didn't know we went down to Seoul.

4206
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:52,680
Wait, that's funny.

4207
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:54,120
We have a Wax Museum?

4208
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:55,500
I didn't know that.

4209
02:57:57,580 --> 02:57:58,820
That's cool.

4210
02:58:16,680 --> 02:58:19,420
I haven't been there.

4211
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:26,920
You see, just walking around, he's very laid back and I point this out because I breathe while in the city and you're going to find that out here in Stanley.

4212
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,760
So that's why we're pointing out this area.

4213
02:58:29,400 --> 02:58:30,780
Here's Stanley Market.

4214
02:58:31,220 --> 02:58:32,200
Oh, Stanley Market!

4215
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:33,320
Now, let's talk about some of the local food.

4216
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:34,900
Hong Kong food is so famous.

4217
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:41,740
You've got Hianese chicken, you've got dim sum, you've got soups that are so much variety.

4218
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:45,920
wonton noodle soup, you've got crispy noodle, haking duck.

4219
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:47,460
Yeah, sumai!

4220
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:48,980
Yeah!

4221
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:50,200
Yeah!

4222
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:52,880
And the soup is soup and beef.

4223
02:58:53,440 --> 02:58:55,520
They've got pork and seafood options.

4224
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:59,680
As a matter of fact, some of the best are so delicious, I try it at least.

4225
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:01,620
Yippee!

4226
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:08,100
Where's this place?

4227
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:11,000
Long, Khaifong.

4228
02:59:11,300 --> 02:59:12,260
It's probably numero uno.

4229
02:59:12,500 --> 02:59:13,380
There's so many.

4230
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:16,500
Yeah, the nightlife is like really good here too.

4231
02:59:20,380 --> 02:59:34,460
It's like... the thing about Hong Kong is that... since it's a city... since it's a city, there's like places where like... basically... there's like... a really big nightlife.

4232
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:36,640
So like the city never sleeps type deal.

4233
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:42,800
Yeah, there's like a lot... huge like... because like there's always something... a place open.

4234
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:46,660
I personally come down here... Oh, is that the tourist spot here?

4235
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:49,160
Next up, let's take...

4236
02:59:50,340 --> 02:59:52,000
This is mainland China.

4237
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:54,900
There's a lot more than just Temple Street.

4238
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:56,640
You can also go... Temple Street?

4239
02:59:56,980 --> 03:00:00,200
In the afternoon, they have some luxury hotels on this side...

4240
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:02,160
Does it close earlier now?

4241
03:00:04,740 --> 03:00:05,300
Aww...

4242
03:00:05,300 --> 03:00:06,760
Kowloon is actually attached...

4243
03:00:06,760 --> 03:00:07,460
Oh, Kowloon.

4244
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:10,100
So that means you can get to Shenzhen...

4245
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:10,380
Yeah!

4246
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:11,400
I would...

4247
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:14,340
But I would say... definitely try some of this street food.

4248
03:00:14,540 --> 03:00:15,040
So delicious.

4249
03:00:15,300 --> 03:00:15,900
I really love it.

4250
03:00:16,040 --> 03:00:16,680
These fish balls.

4251
03:00:17,740 --> 03:00:19,520
Avenue of the stars...

4252
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,400
Now here we are...

4253
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:21,880
Oh, this is a classic place.

4254
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:22,640
This area.

4255
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:26,220
Avenue of the stars... right here... on the Kowloon side.

4256
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:28,980
Avenue of the stars is a great place to get a sunset...

4257
03:00:28,980 --> 03:00:30,720
This is like very common place.

4258
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:32,940
...get shots of the harbor looking out towards...

4259
03:00:32,940 --> 03:00:34,160
Oh my god, Macau!

4260
03:00:34,160 --> 03:00:35,000
Macau!

4261
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,280
You can come over here in the evening time, sunset...

4262
03:00:37,960 --> 03:00:39,600
I would say ideally...

4263
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:40,540
I love Macau.

4264
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:42,880
This is basically our Las Vegas.

4265
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:45,920
For those who don't know... I talked about Macau before.

4266
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:47,560
But...

4267
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:48,940
Um...

4268
03:00:48,940 --> 03:00:51,100
But like for those who don't know...

4269
03:00:51,100 --> 03:00:54,400
Macau is like the Asia Las Vegas.

4270
03:00:54,980 --> 03:00:56,000
So like...

4271
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,740
Like we basically have everything that...

4272
03:00:58,740 --> 03:00:59,660
Las Vegas has.

4273
03:00:59,780 --> 03:01:01,200
We even have a miniature Venice.

4274
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:02,740
Um...

4275
03:01:03,420 --> 03:01:03,940
I...

4276
03:01:04,980 --> 03:01:06,400
I actually stayed...

4277
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:09,660
My grandpa took me to like...

4278
03:01:09,660 --> 03:01:10,680
For the travel guide for Macau...

4279
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:11,700
I'll put a link below...

4280
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:11,880
Okay...

4281
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:13,220
Let me show you guys...

4282
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:14,740
Is it here?

4283
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:15,280
Oh my god, look.

4284
03:01:15,380 --> 03:01:16,760
Oh my god, there's the...

4285
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:17,720
There's like...

4286
03:01:17,720 --> 03:01:18,460
What is it called?

4287
03:01:18,820 --> 03:01:19,300
The clock.

4288
03:01:19,780 --> 03:01:20,000
The...

4289
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:21,020
Ben clock.

4290
03:01:21,020 --> 03:01:21,240
It's not...

4291
03:01:22,940 --> 03:01:23,900
I'm tired.

4292
03:01:24,180 --> 03:01:25,560
It's midnight, guys.

4293
03:01:26,100 --> 03:01:26,620
I'm...

4294
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:27,400
Big Ben.

4295
03:01:28,140 --> 03:01:28,840
I'm sorry.

4296
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:30,060
This place is too small.

4297
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:32,340
The Ben clock.

4298
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:34,720
I'm sorry.

4299
03:01:34,900 --> 03:01:35,680
It's midnight right now.

4300
03:01:35,700 --> 03:01:36,220
I'm tired.

4301
03:01:40,260 --> 03:01:40,780
Um...

4302
03:01:42,660 --> 03:01:44,140
I went to this place.

4303
03:01:44,140 --> 03:01:44,860
In Macau.

4304
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:46,480
And I actually stayed...

4305
03:01:46,480 --> 03:01:47,620
In the hotel up here.

4306
03:01:48,280 --> 03:01:48,520
Uh...

4307
03:01:48,520 --> 03:01:49,960
The Golden Palace.

4308
03:01:49,960 --> 03:01:51,140
I don't remember what it's called.

4309
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:52,600
I did the gondola thing too.

4310
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:53,560
Um...

4311
03:01:53,560 --> 03:01:53,880
But...

4312
03:01:53,880 --> 03:01:56,080
My grandpa booked us to stay here.

4313
03:01:56,260 --> 03:01:56,980
At the...

4314
03:01:56,980 --> 03:01:58,280
The Golden Hotel there.

4315
03:01:58,820 --> 03:01:59,360
To come and go.

4316
03:01:59,640 --> 03:02:00,540
Now let's talk about some more of these...

4317
03:02:00,540 --> 03:02:00,560
Yeah.

4318
03:02:00,740 --> 03:02:02,080
I was allowed to...

4319
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:04,000
Obviously, I wasn't allowed to go into the casino.

4320
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:05,720
But my parents and my grandpa did.

4321
03:02:05,860 --> 03:02:06,860
Because, you know, they're...

4322
03:02:06,860 --> 03:02:08,880
They were over 18.

4323
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:10,180
And I wasn't...

4324
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:12,420
I was just there for the gondolas, I guess.

4325
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:13,280
I...

4326
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:15,640
I guess...

4327
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:18,680
I guess I was just there for the gondolas.

4328
03:02:18,680 --> 03:02:19,680
I don't know.

4329
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:20,560
I...

4330
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:21,360
I...

4331
03:02:21,360 --> 03:02:22,300
I...

4332
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:25,460
I...

4333
03:02:26,680 --> 03:02:27,420
I...

4334
03:02:27,420 --> 03:02:27,680
I...

4335
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:28,460
I...

4336
03:02:28,460 --> 03:02:29,060
I...

4337
03:02:29,060 --> 03:02:30,160
I...

4338
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:30,280
I...

4339
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:31,000
I...

4340
03:02:31,610 --> 03:02:33,420
I remember it being really fun.

4341
03:02:34,160 --> 03:02:34,640
Alright.

4342
03:02:34,860 --> 03:02:35,820
What else can we do?

4343
03:02:36,440 --> 03:02:38,280
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

4344
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,360
What about like...

4345
03:02:42,080 --> 03:02:42,560
Mmm...

4346
03:02:42,560 --> 03:02:43,400
Um...

4347
03:02:43,400 --> 03:02:45,940
As a...

4348
03:02:47,360 --> 03:02:47,840
Okay.

4349
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:50,560
How about as a local?

4350
03:02:50,940 --> 03:02:53,300
Things to do in Hong Kong as a local.

4351
03:02:53,720 --> 03:02:54,800
Maybe like...

4352
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:57,260
That will narrow things down for us.

4353
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:00,920
Um...

4354
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:02,380
Usually, I would just like...

4355
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:05,860
For food, I would definitely check out all the malls that I like to go to.

4356
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:07,840
Um...

4357
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:09,800
To see Venice of Hong Kong Fishing Village.

4358
03:03:09,960 --> 03:03:11,820
They have great Hakka and Shand food.

4359
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,040
And the best shrimp paste in Southeast Asia.

4360
03:03:14,460 --> 03:03:18,900
And I would recommend Chin Chow for their congee plus lots of nice cafes.

4361
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:19,420
Oh!

4362
03:03:19,740 --> 03:03:20,820
Thank you for the recommendation!

4363
03:03:21,480 --> 03:03:22,000
Uh...

4364
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:22,480
Norarkle.

4365
03:03:22,820 --> 03:03:23,320
Thank you for the...

4366
03:03:23,320 --> 03:03:24,760
Thank you, thank you.

4367
03:03:24,940 --> 03:03:27,020
Check out West Kowloon Art Park.

4368
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:28,120
West...

4369
03:03:29,480 --> 03:03:30,000
Kowloon...

4370
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:30,260
Art...

4371
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:31,300
Park.

4372
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:32,380
What is that?

4373
03:03:36,030 --> 03:03:36,550
Alright.

4374
03:03:37,410 --> 03:03:38,830
Ba-dum-bum-ba.

4375
03:03:39,450 --> 03:03:41,650
Which I always wanna show my friends overseas.

4376
03:03:41,890 --> 03:03:42,910
Or even local friends.

4377
03:03:43,270 --> 03:03:43,630
Because...

4378
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:47,230
This place has the best view of Hong Kong right now.

4379
03:03:47,410 --> 03:03:47,830
That's the really...

4380
03:03:47,830 --> 03:03:48,050
That's the public.

4381
03:03:48,150 --> 03:03:48,970
Thank you for the super chat.

4382
03:03:49,110 --> 03:03:49,770
Thank you, thank you.

4383
03:03:49,890 --> 03:03:50,010
Oh!

4384
03:03:51,950 --> 03:03:52,730
That's pretty.

4385
03:03:54,390 --> 03:03:55,850
And this park is so big.

4386
03:03:56,690 --> 03:03:57,690
And you...

4387
03:03:57,690 --> 03:03:57,710
Never worry about that.

4388
03:03:57,710 --> 03:03:58,950
Never worry about that.

4389
03:03:58,950 --> 03:04:01,010
It will be packed with people.

4390
03:04:01,070 --> 03:04:02,210
You know, you have...

4391
03:04:02,210 --> 03:04:03,250
A lot of space.

4392
03:04:03,910 --> 03:04:04,990
You can do anything you want.

4393
03:04:05,130 --> 03:04:05,810
There's a dog!

4394
03:04:07,190 --> 03:04:09,470
I'm not bringing dad over, guys.

4395
03:04:09,750 --> 03:04:12,150
He is not going through a 14 hour flight.

4396
03:04:12,450 --> 03:04:15,070
And there are new restaurants or cafes open.

4397
03:04:15,270 --> 03:04:16,270
Oh, it's a new park?

4398
03:04:16,350 --> 03:04:18,090
It's open five years ago.

4399
03:04:18,970 --> 03:04:19,790
It's like...

4400
03:04:19,790 --> 03:04:20,570
It's this place.

4401
03:04:23,810 --> 03:04:25,470
And one of them is my favorite.

4402
03:04:26,290 --> 03:04:27,450
It's this one.

4403
03:04:27,610 --> 03:04:28,610
It's called...

4404
03:04:28,610 --> 03:04:29,490
Just...

4405
03:04:29,490 --> 03:04:30,510
Coffee...

4406
03:04:30,510 --> 03:04:30,670
Gin.

4407
03:04:31,030 --> 03:04:31,430
Whoa.

4408
03:04:36,450 --> 03:04:37,010
Nice.

4409
03:04:38,910 --> 03:04:41,090
Oh, it's a fancy coffee place.

4410
03:04:43,450 --> 03:04:44,010
Oh...

4411
03:04:44,630 --> 03:04:45,190
Matcha!

4412
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:51,440
Dog!

4413
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:53,680
The hardware of Park Park is amazing.

4414
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:56,320
So you gotta have good software for it.

4415
03:04:57,680 --> 03:04:58,640
Oh my gosh.

4416
03:04:58,860 --> 03:05:00,260
Various amazing events.

4417
03:05:00,460 --> 03:05:00,640
Oh!

4418
03:05:00,760 --> 03:05:01,840
What kind of event is there?

4419
03:05:02,080 --> 03:05:03,860
More and more events in this place.

4420
03:05:03,860 --> 03:05:07,080
Suggests a yearly jazz festival on this day.

4421
03:05:07,480 --> 03:05:08,240
Oh!

4422
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:10,020
They have products from all over the world.

4423
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:11,660
That's cool.

4424
03:05:12,020 --> 03:05:15,040
Most importantly, locally made handcraft beer.

4425
03:05:16,540 --> 03:05:18,780
The most important part!

4426
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:24,480
This is the one thing we're here for.

4427
03:05:24,820 --> 03:05:27,560
The local craft beer.

4428
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:29,380
That's right!

4429
03:05:31,700 --> 03:05:32,180
Beerokadak!

4430
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:36,480
Oh man, that's fun though.

4431
03:05:36,660 --> 03:05:37,400
Okay, I should really call it.

4432
03:05:37,480 --> 03:05:38,340
I just realized it's like...

4433
03:05:38,340 --> 03:05:39,560
I've been streaming for three hours.

4434
03:05:39,820 --> 03:05:40,200
What?

4435
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:41,660
I had a fun time!

4436
03:05:43,220 --> 03:05:44,560
I had a fun time!

4437
03:05:44,860 --> 03:05:45,220
I had a fun time, everybody.

4438
03:05:45,420 --> 03:05:47,800
I'm planning my vacation with you guys.

4439
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:50,780
I hope you guys had a lot of fun too.

4440
03:05:50,980 --> 03:05:52,400
Hang out with me today.

4441
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:52,940
And watching...

4442
03:05:53,900 --> 03:05:54,120
And...

4443
03:05:54,120 --> 03:05:54,940
Sort of...

4444
03:05:54,940 --> 03:05:55,400
We were so...

4445
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:58,280
Sort of low-key being a reaction channel today.

4446
03:05:58,560 --> 03:05:58,940
But...

4447
03:05:58,940 --> 03:05:59,240
It's fine.

4448
03:05:59,260 --> 03:06:00,320
I get one a week.

4449
03:06:00,480 --> 03:06:00,920
I get...

4450
03:06:03,140 --> 03:06:04,940
Yeah, we saw a lot of fun things...

4451
03:06:04,940 --> 03:06:06,120
Fun things to do.

4452
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:08,740
And a lot of good places to eat too.

4453
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:10,180
I'll definitely look back in the chat.

4454
03:06:10,340 --> 03:06:11,160
To like...

4455
03:06:11,160 --> 03:06:11,800
Compile some like...

4456
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:13,660
Uh...

4457
03:06:13,660 --> 03:06:13,820
Uh...

4458
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:14,100
Like...

4459
03:06:14,100 --> 03:06:16,380
Compile all the things that I really wanna do and stuff.

4460
03:06:16,980 --> 03:06:17,380
Uh...

4461
03:06:17,380 --> 03:06:17,800
But...

4462
03:06:17,800 --> 03:06:17,920
Yeah!

4463
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:19,840
I had a lot of fun with you guys today.

4464
03:06:20,020 --> 03:06:21,200
I'm tired now.

4465
03:06:21,320 --> 03:06:21,840
I'm eepy.

4466
03:06:22,180 --> 03:06:24,260
But I hope you guys had fun hanging out with me too.

4467
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:25,440
Um...

4468
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:26,080
Anyway guys!

4469
03:06:26,080 --> 03:06:28,080
I am going to...

4470
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:29,540
Head to bed.

4471
03:06:29,940 --> 03:06:30,280
Now.

4472
03:06:30,860 --> 03:06:31,220
So...

4473
03:06:31,220 --> 03:06:32,300
As always...

4474
03:06:33,180 --> 03:06:33,660
Everybody...

4475
03:06:33,660 --> 03:06:34,260
Stay hydrated.

4476
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:35,740
Posture check.

4477
03:06:36,040 --> 03:06:37,880
Get them around to get that blood flowing.

4478
03:06:38,060 --> 03:06:39,240
And if you stay up for me...

4479
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:40,220
Head to bed.

4480
03:06:40,380 --> 03:06:40,800
Cause...

4481
03:06:40,800 --> 03:06:41,460
You deserve it.

4482
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:43,160
Thank you to all the Hong Kong people!

4483
03:06:43,380 --> 03:06:44,920
For helping me too!

4484
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:46,100
And suggesting stuff.

4485
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:47,600
I really appreciate it.

4486
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:48,220
Uh...

4487
03:06:48,220 --> 03:06:48,860
For like...

03:06:48,860 --> 03:06:50,400
Keeping me up to date on like...

What's going on over there.

4490
03:06:51,940 --> 03:06:52,760
And what like...

4491
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:53,640
What closed down.

4492
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:54,180
And like...

4493
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:55,200
What's fun to do.

4494
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:56,180
Um...

4495
03:06:56,180 --> 03:06:56,760
As a local.

4496
03:06:57,100 --> 03:06:57,940
So thank you guys!

4497
03:06:58,140 --> 03:06:59,760
Thank you for all the Hong Kong dragoons!

4498
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:00,820
For helping me!

4499
03:07:01,220 --> 03:07:01,840
Anyway guys!

4500
03:07:02,120 --> 03:07:03,360
I'm gonna head out and sleep!
