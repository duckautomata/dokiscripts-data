00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,750
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,770
Oh it's so weird being on the left side of the screen every time.

3
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,310
I see myself on the left side and I'm like, this is wrong.

4
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,770
This doesn't feel right.

5
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,050
It was like a little dokey jumpscare.

6
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,530
I was like, whoa!

7
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,110
I'm on the left side!

8
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,150
Oh my god!

9
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,230
What the fuck is this?

10
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,410
What the fuck is that?

11
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,370
You know like that YouTube video, that old YouTube video where he's like, Mom!

12
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,490
What the fuck is that cat?

13
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,730
That's how I feel about myself right now.

14
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,250
It's like, Mom!

15
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,550
Look at that cat!

16
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,350
Oh my god!

17
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,610
What the fuck is this?

18
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,090
A little dokey jumpscare because she's on the left side.

19
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,950
There's a weird fucking bird, Mom!

20
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,610
Anyway, hello everybody!

21
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,530
Hello, hello!

22
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,470
Today, we're gonna be finishing Shadow of the Clown.

23
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,830
I can't believe it.

24
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,350
After so many five-star reviews, she's gonna close down her massage parlor.

25
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,010
But why dokey?

26
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,410
I thought you were having such good business!

27
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,270
I was having too much of a good thing, you know?

28
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,850
Like, the business was going so well that I can basically retire early.

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,170
I'm retiring like 30 years early.

30
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,330
That was just how good.

31
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,550
The tips were just that good.

32
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,410
You know?

33
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,470
It's like they gave away the tips.

34
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,590
They gave away all their life savings to me after the massage parlor was over.

35
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,710
Like, it was crazy.

36
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,310
It's like they didn't need their life savings anymore.

37
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,050
So, um... No, I didn't run out of clients!

38
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,410
No, no, no, no.

39
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,510
I was just doing such a good job that I'm retiring early.

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,970
Uh, because, you know, people were just giving me so much money after I finished my appointments!

41
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,030
It's crazy!

42
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,970
It's like their entire life savings!

43
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,150
I just deleted so much stress out of them.

44
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,090
Um, I think I've been like pretty, uh...

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,470
You know how I was like, oh yeah, I tried to finish games in three years.

46
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,210
I've been like... I'm like so surprised at myself for being able to like keep that consistent!

47
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,510
The consistency of like finishing a game after like three to four streams.

48
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,390
And it's been like super consistent with me.

49
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,090
So, let's hope that I keep the pace with completing this game today.

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,490
I'm gonna not end stream until I kill... I mean, uh, fix.

51
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,850
Until I fix everybody's problems.

52
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,130
Not kill!

53
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,330
I don't know where you heard that.

54
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,830
Alright, thank you for the super chat!

55
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,550
Thank you, thank you!

56
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,550
Can you give us a summary of the story so far?

57
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,370
Like, last time in Shadow of Colossus...

58
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,070
Thank you for the super chat!

59
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,850
Thank you, thank you!

60
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,130
Last time in Shadow of Colossus, I cured...

61
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,210
I cured a bunch of colossi and they were happy.

62
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,910
The end.

63
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,510
Also, I like, neutered one of them, I think.

64
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,130
I solved the iguana issue.

65
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,210
The...

66
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,970
The invasive species of iguanas.

67
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,090
I solved that too.

68
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,230
I just... I'm just a jack of all trades.

69
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,450
Um...

70
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,490
Little life update.

71
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,330
Oh my gosh.

72
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,470
I think, like, next week...

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,130
Uh...

74
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,670
I think next week, I'm definitely going to...

75
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,390
Uh...

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,110
Take a bigger break next week.

77
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,830
I'm gonna take, like, a double...

78
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,830
Cause, you know, usually I take Sunday off.

79
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:08,730
Um...

80
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,510
I think, like, next week I'm gonna take Sunday and Monday off for next week.

81
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,310
Just to, like...

82
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,930
Uh...

83
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,830
Cause, like, one will be...

84
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,010
Cause I know it's, like, rest day.

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,710
But I haven't, like, rested in any of my rest days yet.

86
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,550
So...

87
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,230
I'm gonna take back-to-back rest days.

88
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,490
So, one of them will be the rest day, rest day.

89
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,950
And then the other one will be the rest work day.

90
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,270
So, I'm gonna do, like...

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,830
So, next week I'm gonna take two back-to-back rest days.

92
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,150
So, like, next week's gonna be, like...

93
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,210
I think, like, three rest days.

94
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,170
Um...

95
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,130
And hope that one of them will actually be resting.

96
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,330
Also, thank you for the super chat, Ninja.

97
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,190
Thank you, thank you.

98
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,950
It's my niece's first birthday.

99
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,710
I thought it would be best to open the credit card in their name.

100
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,430
And send you a super chat with that card.

101
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,230
Thank you for the super chat.

102
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,430
Thank you, thank you, Ninja.

103
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,190
You know what would be even funnier?

104
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,930
I mean, like, even better idea?

105
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,430
If, like, you just didn't give her that credit card.

106
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,310
You just, you know...

107
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,190
Okay.

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,950
This is, like, an ethical life hack.

109
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,530
But, like, you know, like...

110
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,710
After the kid is born...

111
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,230
You know, open a credit card in their name.

112
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,210
And then, you know...

113
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,910
Like...

114
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,770
You know, give them good credit, you know?

115
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,470
They might have a little bit of debt.

116
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,430
And then, when they hit...

117
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,570
When they hit at an age where they have their own money...

118
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,150
Um...

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,090
You can give them the card.

120
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,970
And be like, don't worry.

121
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,410
I used it to help you build up credit.

122
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,950
Now, all you have to do is pay off the debt.

123
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,390
Pay off...

124
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,190
Now, all you have to do is pay off the credit card debt.

125
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,130
And then, you'll have great credit.

126
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:38,670
What?

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,830
Start them off young.

128
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,090
Not ruin their credit score.

129
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,030
It's their fault they don't pay it off.

130
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,810
Like, that's credit fraud.

131
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,410
Look, I did say non-ethical life hack.

132
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:51,850
Okay?

133
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,810
I made sure to say it's not that ethical.

134
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,670
It's just a little bit not that ethical.

135
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,930
And like, for legal reasons, let me just say this is a joke in case the IRS is watching.

136
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,850
Okay, the IRS is American.

137
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,110
What the fuck are you gonna do to me?

138
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,730
I'm in Canada.

139
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,630
Okay, anyway...

140
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,970
I might not be able to visit America anymore after I said that.

141
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,670
And...

142
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,370
And...

143
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,030
And...

144
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,430
And...

145
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,450
And...

146
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:17,750
And...

147
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,690
To all you Americans out there.

148
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,810
To all you Americans out there.

149
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,310
Canadians, don't do this because I can be like child in Canadian court.

150
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,130
But to all you American...

151
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,950
To all you Americans out there.

152
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,390
The CRA will come for you.

153
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,650
Anyway...

154
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:42,810
Anyway...

155
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,190
What was I saying?

156
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,770
Oh yeah.

157
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,530
Oh my gosh.

158
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,810
It's been like a super duper...

159
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,790
Okay, now fucking Arlo is the main character again.

160
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,470
Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

161
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,610
Thank you, thank you.

162
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,810
This is fraud only if you get caught.

163
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,590
Anyway...

164
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,510
Life updates.

165
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,210
We have new sub badges!

166
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,210
To be fair, we've had new sub badges for like a couple of days now.

167
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,050
But really haven't had the time to really announce it.

168
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,690
Because we haven't really had like...

169
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,090
I was like...

170
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,090
I think I was like super tired.

171
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,830
So I didn't really...

172
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,890
I forgot to talk about it.

173
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,570
But yes!

174
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,890
We have new sub badges!

175
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,310
Let me see if I can...

176
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,950
I'll pull it up after the stream.

177
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,010
I'm not the stream.

178
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,010
I'll pull it up after we beat the game.

179
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,770
Like the actual...

180
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,310
Like the artwork for it.

181
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,790
But yes!

182
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,590
Yes!

183
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,130
Some of you guys might have already skipped the tomato and the egg form.

184
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,090
So now you're actually dragoons now.

185
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,030
But like...

186
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,690
We have new sub badges!

187
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,410
Oh my god.

188
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,290
Look at all these dragoons!

189
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,250
Any fresh tomatoes out there that we can eat?

190
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,390
Any rare tomatoes?

191
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,010
So...

192
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,730
Speaking of rare tomatoes...

193
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,170
We have a new Doki Bites short from Llama.

194
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,450
And like...

195
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,490
They really...

196
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,450
I don't know if you guys noticed but it's actually like a spiritual continuation of the other short that Llama make.

197
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,210
Where like...

198
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,730
It was like a magical girl transformation.

199
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,370
And then the backwards for like the rare tomato.

200
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,510
So...

201
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,770
The rare tomato transformation.

202
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,550
I just need you guys to know that I made Llama tone it down.

203
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,750
A lot more than what the original was.

204
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,370
The original was like...

205
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,850
The original was a little bit more graphic.

206
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,890
Just saying.

207
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,070
I was like...

208
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,970
Oh yeah.

209
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,490
No.

210
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,190
We gotta...

211
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,590
Oh yeah.

212
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,390
We gotta change that up.

213
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:35,710
Like...

214
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,090
You know...

215
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,650
Even though this isn't really a Christian stream.

216
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,650
Like you know...

217
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,070
This isn't really for kids.

218
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,950
But like...

219
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,690
We don't wanna be R-rated.

220
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,230
You know?

221
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,590
We don't wanna be R-rated.

222
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,110
Lord Crow says thank you for the 10 gift dishes.

223
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,730
Thank you.

224
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,230
Thank you.

225
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,990
Also Trashboy.

226
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,930
Welcome back to the tomato farm.

227
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,430
Welcome.

228
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:57,810
Welcome.

229
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,370
But yes.

230
00:09:59,470 --> 00:09:59,830
Anyway.

231
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,130
So...

232
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,410
It was originally the...

233
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,050
The...

234
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,330
The quote on quote tomato juice.

235
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,670
Was more tomato...

236
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,830
Tomato...

237
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,030
Flavor.

238
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,230
Sorry.

239
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,810
Was more tomato colored.

240
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,730
I was like...

241
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,670
Oh yeah.

242
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,450
No.

243
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,290
Let's just Danganronpa this.

244
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,890
I was like...

245
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,970
Oh yeah.

246
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,090
We're gonna have to Danganronpa this a bit.

247
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,890
So people...

248
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,130
You know.

249
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,350
So YouTube won't be like...

250
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,090
Is that blood?

251
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,230
Cause I've got hit by...

252
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,410
It's very surprising.

253
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,270
Because I actually didn't get hit by Limited for the short.

254
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,350
Because I said to change it to Danganronpa color.

255
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,870
For those who don't know the reference.

256
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,190
It's like the hyper pink.

257
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,210
So it doesn't...

258
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,930
It doesn't look like actual like ketchup.

259
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,410
You know?

260
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,690
So it doesn't...

261
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:45,830
And then...

262
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,870
Um...

263
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,550
Um...

264
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,370
Release the Llamaca.

265
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,730
Thank you for the super chat.

266
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,370
Darkblade.

267
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,810
Thank you.

268
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,310
Thank you.

269
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,310
So I was like...

270
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,490
Yeah.

271
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,170
Let's just...

272
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,350
Yeah.

273
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,170
Let's make the tomato juices like...

274
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:58,450
You know.

275
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,750
More neon pink.

276
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,630
Instead of...

277
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,910
You know.

278
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,210
Tomato ketchup color.

279
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,310
Because...

280
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:03,810
I don't...

281
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:03,910
Yeah.

282
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,150
I don't wanna fucking...

283
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,730
I don't wanna get in trouble here.

284
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,830
And also like...

285
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,050
The sounds was a lot worse.

286
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,610
There was...

287
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,010
Okay.

288
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,290
So there was one where...

289
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,550
I don't know if you watched the short.

290
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,630
There was one where the leaves were coming out of the head.

291
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,010
And then there was the...

292
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,450
It was...

293
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,370
The sound for that was...

294
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,290
Not great.

295
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,930
Like it was very like...

296
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,590
Yeah.

297
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,410
And I was like...

298
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,650
Bro.

299
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:27,970
Okay.

300
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,390
We're gonna remove the sound for the head part.

301
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,410
Because like...

302
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,490
I think like...

303
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:32,850
You know.

304
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,490
All the others...

305
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:33,690
You know.

306
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,350
You can see the...

307
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,110
The stick limbs.

308
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,870
But then on the head...

309
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,490
When you hear that sound...

310
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,530
It's pretty bad.

311
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,030
I don't know.

312
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,310
Especially when...

313
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,430
It's at the head.

314
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,630
So we gonna...

315
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,870
I'm gonna have to ask to remove that...

316
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:50,930
Because...

317
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,190
Because I'm worried.

318
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,970
So we had to...

319
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,550
We had to like...

320
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,490
Tone it down a little bit.

321
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,630
Because I didn't want to...

322
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,750
I just want you guys to know...

323
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,850
The reason why I asked to tone it down...

324
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:24,570
The experience I've had, not on this channel, but there was a short on another channel that got hit by limited ads and was marked by YouTube because there was blood on it.

325
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,910
And they were like, no, no, no, that's blood.

326
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,410
So I was like, okay, now I know.

327
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,330
It's funny that the sound didn't get hit by the limited ads, but I think it's because they're like, oh, hey, look, it's not red.

328
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,330
So it's not actually blood.

329
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,910
So you're okay, Doki.

330
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,410
You're okay, Doki.

331
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,970
I was like, oh my gosh, I was so surprised.

332
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,150
Anyway, artistic integrity is shabby.

333
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,990
Thank you, MagentaSoupa.

334
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,010
Thank you, thank you.

335
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:08,310
So I got from that experience, I figured out like how to bypass the censorship on YouTube because apparently ad companies...

336
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,590
Like the current version.

337
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,250
Also another funny thing regarding updates.

338
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,910
So I was like talking to my YouTube guy being like, so why is like some of my VODs getting hit by limited recently?

339
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,950
Because I've never had that experience before.

340
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,670
And then my YouTube guy was like looking through the VODs because like I have to like, I get hit by limited.

341
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,350
And then after the stream, I get hit by limited.

342
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,610
And then I have to like appeal it.

343
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,170
I have to like actually appeal it and be like, why is this hit by limited?

344
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,790
Like what the fuck's going on?

345
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,930
And then my YouTube guy looked at it.

346
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,750
Like the content warning.

347
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,290
I got hit by limited ads on the content warning stream.

348
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,830
So I got really confused.

349
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,990
I was like, why the fuck did I get hit by limited ads?

350
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:52,630
And then I appealed it and then they got like fixed the date like a couple hours later.

351
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,670
And then my YouTube guy was like, oh, yeah, I'm looking through the VODs and I think it's because of profi-

352
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,570
Yeah, like you swear a lot.

353
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,010
I was like, what the fuck?

354
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,950
What do you mean?

355
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,190
Profanity!

356
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,730
And he was like, well, you do swear a lot in the beginning of these videos.

357
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,110
And I think like the auto detection was like, that's a lot of swearing.

358
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,190
He's like, I guess it's profanity.

359
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,930
I can't see why else you got hit.

360
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,030
And then...

361
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,050
And then I was like, that is bullshit!

362
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,310
Okay, I didn't say that.

363
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,810
I was like, okay, this is what I say.

364
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,650
I was like, that's so weird.

365
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,230
Because in the past, I rarely, if ever, got hit by profanity.

366
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,370
So I was like, what do you mean profanity?

367
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,030
I've never changed the way I talk.

368
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,610
I've always had profanity.

369
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,910
Why now?

370
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,710
Why?

371
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,970
I was like, why?

372
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,090
Why did I get hit by profanity now of all times?

373
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:13,970
So...

374
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,030
Um...

375
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,630
Um...

376
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,630
So yeah, so that's why I've been being hit by limited.

377
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,910
But the thing is, I just have to appeal it.

378
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,670
And then they're like, okay, you're good now.

379
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,330
But it was so weird.

380
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,850
It hits me like ever so often.

381
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,870
Like one or two streams.

382
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,430
It'll be like one stream and then the next stream will be okay.

383
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,050
Or maybe two streams in a row will get hit by limited.

384
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,610
And the next stream will be okay.

385
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,030
And I just have to appeal it.

386
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,850
Every time I appeal it, they're like, good to go.

387
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,790
But I was so surprised.

388
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,370
I was like, profanity?

389
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,430
Another update.

390
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,570
Another life update.

391
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:49,730
Um...

392
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,710
I've been so fucking busy.

393
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,290
Because like every day I have like...

394
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:54,770
Oh my gosh.

395
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,450
I have like these like business meetings.

396
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,130
Or like business decisions to make and stuff like that.

397
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,330
Oh my gosh.

398
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,090
I don't want to like spoil anything.

399
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,110
But...

400
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,030
It's been a problem.

401
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,170
Where I have so many...

402
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,190
It's so difficult.

403
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,750
I hate making decisions.

404
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,150
I hate making choices.

405
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,810
Especially when I do want to do everything.

406
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,350
Goodbye Arlo.

407
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,750
He's going to be the main character again.

408
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,950
Because like there's like instances where...

409
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,950
So like one of these things I can talk about is that you know like the Doki Bird World Tour?

410
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,090
It's come to a point where we have...

411
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,850
There's like so many conventions are asking for me to be a guest.

412
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,070
That like the dates are conflicting with each other.

413
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,010
So I have to pick and choose.

414
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,450
Which convention I want to do.

415
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,550
And I was like...

416
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,390
I hate it because I want to do them all.

417
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,070
I want to do them all.

418
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,110
So then I was like...

419
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,730
Oh my gosh.

420
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,190
Like there's like so many conventions.

421
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,870
And I was like...

422
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,970
Oh man I want to do this.

423
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,810
And I also want to do that.

424
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,790
And I also want to do that.

425
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,930
But I have to pick one.

426
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,330
Because there's only one Doki Bird for those days.

427
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,110
And I was like...

428
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,370
No.

429
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,410
There's so many.

430
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,070
So like there's going to be a point where there's going to be a convention.

431
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,310
For me.

432
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,790
Like almost every month.

433
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,630
We haven't hit that streak.

434
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,730
We have obviously like...

435
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,450
There's no conventions in April.

436
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,770
No conventions in April.

437
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,230
Because I was a little too late.

438
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,390
But like...

439
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,630
We're going to have a convention.

440
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,290
Almost like a convention guest.

441
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,550
Almost every month.

442
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,370
And it's going to be like around the world type deal.

443
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,970
So it's like...

444
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,570
Oh it won't be like just focusing on one area.

445
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,570
Just NA or anything.

446
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,210
Just think it's the world tour for a reason.

447
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,450
It's the world tour for a reason.

448
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,950
So just get ready.

449
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,990
We're just going to be a lot of Doki Birds.

450
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,170
So...

451
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,370
Oh my gosh.

452
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,590
But it makes me so sad.

453
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,470
Because I can only pick like one.

454
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,370
Like I can only do like one.

455
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,270
Not like...

456
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,050
Like you know when there's so many going at the same time.

457
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,910
Like on the same dates too.

458
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,150
I think that's the worst part.

459
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,970
When they're on the same date.

460
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,450
And I can only do one.

461
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,070
And I'm like...

462
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,470
No.

463
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,050
But what if I want to do them all.

464
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,670
On.

465
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,070
Is that fair?

466
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,370
I just want to do them all.

467
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,950
But yeah that's basically what it's been like at the moment.

468
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,590
What's going on right now.

469
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,550
Pastries.

470
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,270
I know.

471
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,470
I know.

472
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,170
But like they're all so fun to do.

473
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,310
Yeah.

474
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,090
Anyway.

475
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,690
Alright thank you for the super chat.

476
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,050
Thank you.

477
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,450
Thank you.

478
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,730
Idea.

479
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,210
Hire a Doki Bird too.

480
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,970
She can make appearances in Spongebob ships for you.

481
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,670
Easy.

482
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,670
If only it was that easy.

483
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,150
Anyway.

484
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,750
Alright.

485
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,730
Let's actually play.

486
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,330
Let me move my...

487
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,530
Let me move myself real fast.

488
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,030
Let's look at...

489
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,850
Let's look at a different screen.

490
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,210
Alright.

491
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,290
Time to look at the...

492
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,330
At the gaming screen.

493
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,030
Alright.

494
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,710
That was the life updates.

495
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,990
Now we actually game.

496
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,450
Woo!

497
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,390
Alright.

498
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,110
Massage parlor is open.

499
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,450
Continue.

500
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,090
The massage parlor is now open.

501
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,550
Alright.

502
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,350
Where am I?

503
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,450
Hello.

504
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:18,990
That's me.

505
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:21,870
Don't worry.

506
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,890
The specialist is here.

507
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,730
Alright.

508
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,590
Let's see.

509
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,510
Where do I go?

510
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,010
Where the fuck do I go?

511
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,370
Where do I go?

512
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,150
Time to actually game.

513
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:40,530
Sorry.

514
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,430
It took me 20 minutes to get started.

515
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,190
But here we go.

516
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,610
Where the fuck...

517
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,450
Where do I go?

518
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,410
Why is my sword not taking me anywhere?

519
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:50,610
Oh.

520
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:50,970
This way.

521
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,270
Alright.

522
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:51,610
Arlo.

523
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,450
Arlo.

524
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:53,990
Let's go.

525
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,510
Arlo.

526
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,490
Arlo.

527
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,270
Arlo.

528
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,870
Arlo.

529
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,370
Come on.

530
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,390
Arlo.

531
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,610
Come on.

532
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,250
You had like...

533
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,710
You had 20 minutes to rest.

534
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,090
Arlo.

535
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,330
Arlo.

536
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,710
Why are you just walking?

537
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,990
You had 20 minutes to rest.

538
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:06,570
The rest...

539
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:06,870
Arlo.

540
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,150
Alright.

541
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,710
The tangent was necessary to the plot.

542
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,590
Alright.

543
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,070
Here we go.

544
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,930
I can't believe it.

545
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,470
Okay.

546
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,790
I can't believe it either.

547
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,590
I can't believe I forgot how to ride a horse.

548
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,490
Alright.

549
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,030
Let's see.

550
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,990
How do I do this?

551
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,390
Nope.

552
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,970
That's duck.

553
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,690
That's my sword.

554
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,230
How do I...

555
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,150
Guys.

556
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,170
Oh.

557
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,430
Okay.

558
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,110
It's...

559
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,010
It's triangle.

560
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,290
I figured it out, guys.

561
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,690
I figured it out.

562
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,910
Okay.

563
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:35,450
So...

564
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:35,990
I'm gonna go to the other side.

565
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,130
The next coloss...

566
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,410
My next appointment is like this way.

567
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,610
Here we go.

568
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,490
This is my next appointment.

569
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,610
I have so many projects going on behind the scenes, but...

570
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,810
It's actually...

571
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,830
You're like, how many...

572
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,170
Are you...

573
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,970
How much stuff are you doing behind the scenes?

574
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,770
And I'm like, yes.

575
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,030
Every day, I wake up to like 20 plus discreet messages.

576
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,970
I was like, I wake up and I was like, oh, god.

577
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:21,930
I just got mad.

578
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,810
I will get...

579
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,250
I took a deep, deep shower and I'm like, dude.

580
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,850
I don't want to know, like, what my habit is and I'm like, okay, that got me a little bit of a headache.

581
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,790
Oh, my god.

582
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:28,870
Oh, my God.

583
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,110
Oh, my God.

584
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,730
I'm really like...

585
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,470
Oh my God.

586
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,110
Oh, my God.

587
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,170
Oh, my God.

588
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:34,310
Oh, my God.

589
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:40,250
It seems that's gonna build up soon so we can actually have something fun on the channel.

590
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,790
How do I... is it like this way?

591
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,790
I guess it's on the... it has to be on the other side.

592
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:45,970
We're still cooking.

593
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,370
We're cooking so many things right now.

594
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,690
Back to back.

595
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,770
Cease!

596
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,830
You're gonna burn out!

597
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,250
Guys, the thing is I'm like a huge workaholic.

598
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,050
But like also like I still... I still... I do need like rest days though.

599
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,470
The reason why I have rest days is because I do want to rest at some points.

600
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,830
But like I think like I can like work as well on the rest day.

601
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,610
But like I just want to like not talk.

602
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,270
Like you know be like... be like a mute for a day.

603
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,430
And I think like that's what's like tilting for me.

604
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,010
When I have to like do... like actually use my mouth.

605
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,970
When I have to actually like talk and like do like business meetings and make like business decisions.

606
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,250
On my rest day.

607
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,810
Like but I can't like do it via text.

608
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,830
I'm fine if like it's via text or something.

609
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,170
Like oh make this decision.

610
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,390
And then like... have I been here before?

611
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,610
Have I killed the salamander here before?

612
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,750
Time to pray.

613
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,950
But like if it's like... I don't know.

614
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,150
Actually can't tell.

615
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,130
I can't tell.

616
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,470
All these shrines are blurring together.

617
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,230
Oh no I haven't!

618
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,530
Look there's a salamander right here!

619
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,030
But like... if I have to like use my...

620
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,310
mouth during my rest day.

621
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,330
That's when I get tilted.

622
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,610
That's when I'm like... please.

623
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,530
Please I just wanna be a mute for a day and not talk.

624
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,370
Cause I wanna make sure my throat will be okay.

625
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,870
Where the fuck is that bitch?

626
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,630
I thought we solved the invasive species issue.

627
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,030
Where is him?

628
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,870
Where is he?

629
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,650
Hello?

630
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,490
Hello?

631
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,570
Where the fuck is he?

632
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,870
Where did he go?

633
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,850
Hello?

634
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,150
Little iguana boy?

635
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:36,450
Hello?

636
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,410
Where the fuck is he?

637
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,690
Where did he go?

638
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,890
Alright we're gonna have to climb.

639
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,070
Guys give me a second.

640
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:46,770
You remember how to climb?

641
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,730
Guys the most important mechanic.

642
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,070
Give me a second.

643
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,070
Okay alright.

644
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:53,850
It's RT.

645
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,590
Alright.

646
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,390
I need to fucking grab some HP.

647
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,510
Oh my gosh no.

648
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,990
Where did he go?

649
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,330
I don't see him anymore.

650
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,790
He vanished.

651
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:06,950
Alright.

652
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,250
Give me this way.

653
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,390
Okay.

654
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,670
And then...

655
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,410
This way.

656
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,150
He has to show up somewhere.

657
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,130
How the fuck do I climb this?

658
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,550
How do I climb this?

659
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,130
Oh my god.

660
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:23,990
Excuse me?

661
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,890
There's nothing I can grab?

662
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,690
Oh there it is.

663
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,790
Alright there you go.

664
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,050
And got it.

665
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,010
Thanks Arlo for just watching me and not helping at all.

666
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,230
Alright.

667
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,230
He has to be here.

668
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,210
Oh there he is.

669
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,990
That's fucking right.

670
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,410
I see you.

671
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,810
Oh you bitch!

672
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,430
You fucker.

673
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:42,750
Okay.

674
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,050
He dropped down?

675
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,610
Where did he go?

676
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,470
Where the fuck did he go?

677
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,430
Oh you little fuck.

678
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,230
Okay I see you.

679
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,530
I see you.

680
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,070
Can't hide from me forever.

681
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,410
I'm gonna fucking eat you.

682
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,070
No!

683
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,030
Jesus!

684
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,090
Okay.

685
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,390
I'm gonna eat you soon.

686
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,770
It might not be now.

687
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,770
But I swear to god I'm gonna eat you.

688
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,790
Okay let's... I can figure out how to climb up again.

689
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:11,470
Ugh.

690
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,830
Alright.

691
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,090
Oh my god.

692
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,930
Where the fuck do I climb?

693
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,850
Okay here you go.

694
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,010
Okay this one has to be the hardest one.

695
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,930
The other one... The other just like walked into my mouth.

696
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,930
I don't know why.

697
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,710
I don't know why.

698
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,370
Why don't you wanna be consumed?

699
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,010
Like... Why not?

700
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,730
It'll be like a fun journey to my stomach.

701
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,110
Alright.

702
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,930
Here we go.

703
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,410
Up.

704
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,090
Up.

705
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,910
Yay!

706
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:37,610
Oh.

707
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,370
Up.

708
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,290
There you go.

709
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,630
Where the fuck is Salamander again?

710
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,170
Where did he go?

711
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,190
Where did he go?

712
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,310
Where is he?

713
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,770
Oh I hear him.

714
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,250
No!

715
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,270
Stop!

716
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,550
I hear his feet.

717
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,950
They're like Bomberman feet.

718
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,350
The pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.

719
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,270
Okay.

720
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,190
Where is he?

721
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,930
Okay if I do it like this will he...

722
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,370
Will he like... If I stealth...

723
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,210
Maybe if I stealth like this he'll show up.

724
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,130
No!

725
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,290
No no no no no no no!

726
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,890
Climb back up!

727
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:16,670
Please!

728
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,790
I need that stamina!

729
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,450
Where did he go?

730
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,230
How did you see me?

731
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:21,670
Oh.

732
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,030
He didn't see me.

733
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,490
He didn't see me.

734
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,410
He's just casually back there.

735
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,770
This is so fucked up.

736
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,370
This is so fucked up.

737
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,970
How the fuck do I get to here?

738
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,870
Okay what if I like...

739
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,930
Oh I got an idea.

740
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,410
I got an idea.

741
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,150
I'm just gonna slowly walk to the other side.

742
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,270
I'm gonna slowly walk to the other side and then like...

743
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,690
I'll have the perfect angle on him.

744
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,830
Right here.

745
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,730
Come on.

746
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,570
You gotta get up.

747
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,930
You gotta climb up.

748
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,910
You can't hang in there forever.

749
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,770
There you go.

750
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,690
The perfect angle.

751
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,390
Nice.

752
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,690
Okay.

753
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,050
There you go.

754
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,670
I'm just gonna hit the side.

755
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,510
Watch this.

756
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,870
Okay.

757
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:12,590
Now watch this.

758
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,490
There he got 12-jew!

759
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,570
Where did he go?

760
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,430
Where did he go?

761
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,430
Oh my god.

762
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,270
He has to be dead.

763
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,490
There's no way he's alive.

764
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,790
I should... Oh yeah.

765
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,790
He fucking disappeared.

766
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,490
Thank god.

767
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,030
That has to be the hardest one so far.

768
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:26,390
So far.

769
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,970
I knew it.

770
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,970
I knew it.

771
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,150
Alright.

772
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,010
Time to kill...

773
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,750
Now time to kill the colossi.

774
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:34,770
Alright.

775
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,230
Where is it?

776
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,490
Nope.

777
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,410
That's not the sword.

778
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,250
When will I get a magic bow?

779
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,610
I feel like I deserve it.

780
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,950
This way.

781
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,250
Okay.

782
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,390
Alright.

783
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:50,430
Thank you to that backseater that told me that I don't have to actually navigate my horse.

784
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,230
I don't have to actually move my horse.

785
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,570
He does the auto-travel for me.

786
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,630
Okay.

787
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,790
Where is that?

788
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,250
Where the fuck is that?

789
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,270
Is this?

790
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,150
There's no oasis here.

791
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:07,750
God.

792
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,970
I wish the maps actually work.

793
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:13,750
Oh wait.

794
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,690
Have I...

795
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,850
Have I consumed these fruits before?

796
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,030
No I haven't.

797
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,210
Alright.

798
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:19,890
It's fruit time.

799
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,790
It's time to eat the fruit.

800
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,590
Alright.

801
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,130
Let's see.

802
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,950
Fruit time!

803
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,330
Snack break!

804
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,290
Alright.

805
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:27,870
Boop.

806
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,530
Can horses just eat grass and then survive?

807
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,850
Or do they actually need real food?

808
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,950
Is it possible if you just like...

809
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,450
Oh hey.

810
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,030
Did they just eat grass?

811
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,330
Can they survive?

812
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:44,970
Yeah?

813
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:45,810
Wait.

814
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,310
That's really?

815
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,710
They don't need actual hay?

816
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,770
So like I can just leave a horse in somebody's backyard and they'll be okay?

817
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,430
Can we live off grass?

818
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,890
So like does that mean like humans can live off grass too?

819
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,690
Or are we just like fucked?

820
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,470
Cause like grass is vegetables.

821
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,830
If you think about it.

822
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,530
No?

823
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,170
Why not?

824
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,530
Why can animals live off grass when we can't?

825
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,290
They still need water?

826
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,590
There's water on grass.

827
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,650
Like grass need water to live.

828
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,370
And then like...

829
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,930
If grass need water to live.

830
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:23,630
It's like cactus.

831
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,310
When you eat a cactus there's water inside.

832
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,410
We can't digest grass?

833
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,890
You need more stomachs to digest grass?

834
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,890
God we're so fucking weak.

835
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,650
Why can't we genetically modify ourselves dude?

836
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,530
This is why we need survival of the fittest.

837
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,050
So you know how like for insects?

838
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,850
You know how like we...

839
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,390
Selective bred them?

840
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,210
And...

841
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,170
Wait that's eugenics.

842
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:56,690
Wait that's bad.

843
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,530
Disregard everything I said.

844
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,930
Guys that was a joke guys.

845
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,450
Guys that was a joke.

846
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,050
That was...

847
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,830
That was a fucking joke guys.

848
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,470
Pull back.

849
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,430
Pull back.

850
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,390
We don't need six stomachs guys.

851
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,710
No we don't.

852
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,170
We don't need six stomachs.

853
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,610
We're fine.

854
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,410
We don't need six stomachs guys.

855
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,630
One is good enough.

856
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,450
Why would we need to eat grass?

857
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,570
Don't be fucking stupid chat.

858
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,970
Don't be...

859
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,790
Don't be fucking...

860
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,070
Don't be stupid.

861
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,190
One is enough.

862
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,110
Why would we need all these...

863
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,970
Where the fuck is my sun GPS?

864
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,210
Where is my sun GPS?

865
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,370
Oh my god.

866
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,330
We're in a desert and I don't have a GPS.

867
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,690
How do I live?

868
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,310
Oh it's right here.

869
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,930
It's right here.

870
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,450
Don't deny me my third stomach like this.

871
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,310
All I'm saying is that...

872
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,850
Okay you know how like how stick insects are born?

873
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,470
Like how we've like...

874
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,350
How stick insects like evolved?

875
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,670
Basically like it's not that they know what sticks look like.

876
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:34,110
It's that eventually the insect like you know the insects that don't look like a stick got eaten up too many times by the birds.

877
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:45,270
And then like at one point that the insects that looked like sticks were able to live on and like breathe like crazy and then become the sick insects that it's become.

878
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,310
So like we should...

879
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,230
Ethically speaking it's so fucked up.

880
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,490
But like...

881
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,150
Don't double down.

882
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,910
What if like...

883
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,650
Okay what if...

884
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,670
Okay what if like...

885
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,050
Alright.

886
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,810
This is gonna be a little bit of like...

887
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,770
Like...

888
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,990
Like philosophical thing.

889
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,690
Like it's gonna be based off that movie with like Andrew Garfield where like the clone...

890
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,970
We start cloning.

891
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,650
Like at one point we're gonna be able to start cloning.

892
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,730
And then we clone like these people.

893
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,710
We start cloning ourselves but they have like no...

894
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,630
Because they're clones.

895
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,190
You know they have...

896
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,730
They have you know...

897
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,210
Yeah they're not real...

898
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,570
They're not real people if you think about it.

899
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,170
Okay so like...

900
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,810
So like we put these clones...

901
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,790
We put these clones in a room and it's just grass.

902
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,630
And the room will just be...

903
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,530
Be grass, you know.

904
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,630
And then...

905
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,650
And then so like the thing is...

906
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,490
The thing is...

907
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,530
Eventually the clone with the three...

908
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,710
Eventually the clones will evolve until...

909
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,790
Until...

910
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,790
I'm not ignoring it.

911
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,970
I'm trying to figure out the GPS right now.

912
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:15,830
The clones will evolve in a way where they eventually have more than one stomach because...

913
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,130
Because we just put them in a room filled with grass.

914
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,270
And then at one point...

915
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,270
At one point, the clones will be able to have...

916
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:29,290
They will be able to evolve into people with more than one stomach.

917
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,990
And then we take those clones and they are now...

918
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,550
They... and then like, you know...

919
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,730
We put them with the real humans.

920
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,070
And then they will make babies...

921
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,190
With the clone DNA with more than one stomach.

922
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,630
There you go.

923
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,310
Where the fuck is the entrance?

924
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,350
Is it here?

925
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,650
Is... have I been like dodging this hole this entire...

926
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,710
No, that's not a...

927
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,170
That does not look like a safe hole.

928
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,270
That is... unless...

929
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,650
Unless... it has to be here.

930
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,470
Where else would it be?

931
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,170
I've been like fucking walking around to this...

932
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,570
Same hole... multiple times.

933
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,290
It has to be this hole.

934
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,630
Where else could it be?

935
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,170
Okay, this seems safe, right?

936
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,590
Is it safe?

937
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,830
What if...

938
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,190
I'm just trying to make the optimal human where we can survive off grass alone.

939
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,490
It'll solve like food shortages.

940
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,090
We can literally just go outside and eat the grass.

941
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,050
If we have more than one stomach.

942
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,090
Like think about it guys.

943
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,810
I don't know.

944
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,490
If we have more than one stomach.

945
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,370
Then we can just eat grass.

946
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,450
And then it'll be like optimal survival.

947
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,410
The optimal human.

948
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,630
Because like at that point we'll have like enough.

949
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,430
We'll be able to like consume...

950
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,630
Oh my god, it's all the way over there.

951
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,570
Okay, but what if I just jump?

952
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,030
Can't be that bad.

953
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,430
I mean I already prayed.

954
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,810
Okay guys.

955
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:13,930
Alright.

956
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,570
Guys, I'm stuck.

957
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,050
Oh my god.

958
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,410
Oh my...

959
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:19,870
No!

960
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,500
Guys.

961
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,420
I lived.

962
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,680
I lived!

963
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,200
I fucking knew it!

964
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,980
I knew it.

965
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,900
I knew it would work.

966
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,060
I knew it would work guys.

967
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,680
I'm a fucking genius.

968
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,000
Arlo get down from here.

969
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,220
I lived.

970
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,080
I lived.

971
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,200
Guys, this is it.

972
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,340
Guys, I am the optimal human being.

973
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,120
If we like...

974
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,720
If we clone me.

975
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,120
And then...

976
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,940
Guys.

977
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,040
Guys, we can have like Doki clones that can survive bigger falls guys.

978
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,620
Think about it.

979
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,280
I can't see this.

980
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,540
What the fuck is...

981
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:08,880
What...

982
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,520
Where am I going?

983
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,420
Oh, is it here?

984
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,020
This has to be it.

985
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,880
This has to be it.

986
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,610
Total Doki-fication.

987
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,310
Guys, just think about how many like conventions I can go to.

988
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,570
Thank you for the super chat.

989
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,030
Thank you.

990
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,510
Thank you.

991
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,570
What the fuck do I do here?

992
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:36,810
Whoa!

993
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,410
Ow!

994
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:37,970
Okay.

995
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,030
Okay.

996
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,610
Where am I?

997
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,530
Where...

998
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,850
Where am I?

999
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,330
Where did he fucking knock me?

1000
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,850
All right, guys.

1001
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,450
We got the...

1002
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,650
Where am I?

1003
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,410
Oh, it's this way.

1004
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,570
How the fuck did he knock me off?

1005
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,390
What the fuck?

1006
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,570
Okay, here we go.

1007
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,950
Here we go again.

1008
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,930
All right.

1009
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,210
I can barely see the stage.

1010
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,110
What the fuck do I do?

1011
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,250
Arrel?

1012
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,750
Okay, Arrel.

1013
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,390
Okay.

1014
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:14,830
Okay.

1015
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,330
Boop!

1016
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:16,690
Boop!

1017
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,950
You don't do like that.

1018
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,230
You can't get me because you can't walk up ramps.

1019
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,130
Hehe.

1020
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,630
Where the fuck do I go?

1021
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,150
What a loser.

1022
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,270
Yeah, you wish you can get me right now.

1023
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,190
Bet you.

1024
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,250
Yeah, that's right.

1025
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,430
That's right.

1026
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,970
I'm here for the session, guys.

1027
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,670
Bro, how am I supposed to give you acupuncture if I can't even see where the acupuncture?

1028
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,370
Alright, where is his fucking heart?

1029
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,950
Oh yeah, there's no sun.

1030
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,670
Alright,

1031
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,530
we haven't...

1032
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,230
Wait, where am I?

1033
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,010
I jumped down again.

1034
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,730
Sorry, guys.

1035
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,390
I jumped down again.

1036
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,570
Okay.

1037
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,670
Okay, this time.

1038
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,330
This time.

1039
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,610
It's so hard to see, bro!

1040
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,130
Turn off your fucking brightness!

1041
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,910
How?

1042
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,890
I don't know!

1043
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,330
Turn off your fucking brightness!

1044
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,350
I can barely see where it starts!

1045
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,370
Okay, I'm here.

1046
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,950
I'm here now.

1047
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,170
Oh my god, I need to climb up.

1048
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,850
Can I climb up this?

1049
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,350
Bro, like, go near the fire.

1050
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,130
Alright, I'm near the fire.

1051
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,110
Here I am.

1052
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,010
I have the light now.

1053
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,090
I have the high ground.

1054
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:43,990
What are you gonna do about it?

1055
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,170
Oh.

1056
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,430
That's right!

1057
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,310
Nothing!

1058
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,790
Can't do anything about it!

1059
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,690
I live here now!

1060
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,530
Wait, what's this?

1061
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,750
Oh, shit.

1062
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,950
Guys, I was just joking, sir.

1063
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,270
Sir, sir, sir.

1064
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,230
I was just joking.

1065
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,390
Please let me get up, sir.

1066
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,470
Sir, please.

1067
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:02,590
Please do.

1068
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,290
Sir, please!

1069
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,490
Please do not sunlock me, sir!

1070
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,450
This is not a fighting game!

1071
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:08,750
Sir, please!

1072
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:09,950
We're... we...

1073
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,570
Where am I?

1074
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,690
Where even am I?

1075
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,570
Oh there it is!

1076
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,190
I see it!

1077
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:14,730
I see it!

1078
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,730
Ow!

1079
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,790
Please, sir, let me grab the torch!

1080
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,510
No!

1081
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:33,070
I can barely see the fucking screen!

1082
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,490
Alright, let's- here we go again.

1083
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,850
Guys, guys, I swear to god.

1084
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,010
This is like the most diff- it's so dark!

1085
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,610
Oh my god, I can barely- okay, here we go.

1086
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,930
I'm gonna fall, alright?

1087
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,270
I feel like I'm gonna fall again.

1088
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,870
Bro, why are you edgeguarding?

1089
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,010
Are you fucking playing Smash Bros or some shit?

1090
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,030
Oh god, oh god.

1091
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:01,930
Be gone.

1092
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:02,970
Ow!

1093
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,470
Guys, I don't think he likes me.

1094
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,590
Is this even on fire?

1095
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,550
No, it's not.

1096
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,510
No, please!

1097
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,570
Let me climb!

1098
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,770
Please.

1099
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,490
Please.

1100
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,890
At least let me get up, please!

1101
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,850
Oh god.

1102
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,330
This is so fucked up, man.

1103
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,110
This is actually so fucked up.

1104
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,110
Oh god, I'm okay.

1105
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,630
Guys, it's okay!

1106
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:46,810
Guys!

1107
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,370
It's okay!

1108
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,570
I'm okay, guys.

1109
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,250
Don't worry.

1110
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,650
Oh, thank god.

1111
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,610
Oh, thank god he stopped.

1112
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,430
Oh, thank god he stopped.

1113
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,210
Alright, here we go.

1114
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,350
Here we go.

1115
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,530
And god said, let there be light.

1116
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,270
Ow!

1117
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,390
Okay.

1118
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,490
Alright.

1119
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:03,850
Be gone!

1120
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,590
Be gone!

1121
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,950
Go to the light!

1122
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,030
Go to the light!

1123
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,790
No!

1124
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,170
Fuck!

1125
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,430
Go to the light!

1126
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,570
I need light to work!

1127
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,610
Sir!

1128
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,910
I need light to work!

1129
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,370
There you go.

1130
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:26,990
We're fine.

1131
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,950
Oh, thank god.

1132
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:28,870
Alright.

1133
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,730
That's all we have to do.

1134
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:31,730
We took off his clothes.

1135
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,010
He'll be fine.

1136
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,390
Where is he?

1137
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,370
Where the fuck did he land?

1138
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,850
Where did his body go?

1139
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,390
What the fuck?

1140
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,550
Bro, he's gone.

1141
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,890
Where is his body?

1142
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,210
Did he land all the way here?

1143
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,510
Oh, he did.

1144
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,510
What the fuck?

1145
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,170
Why is he here?

1146
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,450
Okay.

1147
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,270
Knife time.

1148
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,630
Stabby stab!

1149
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,650
Wee!

1150
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,430
Alright.

1151
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,530
Here we go.

1152
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,950
There we go.

1153
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,650
There we go.

1154
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,350
Oh my god.

1155
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,810
Thank fucking god, bro.

1156
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,150
Okay.

1157
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,410
Look at all the stress juice in your back, sir!

1158
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,530
Those not healthy men!

1159
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,750
Keeping all that inside you!

1160
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,130
Oh god.

1161
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:18,430
Oh.

1162
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,370
Oh.

1163
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:19,430
Oh.

1164
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,290
Sir!

1165
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,310
We got a cracker!

1166
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,170
I'm a chiropractor too now as well.

1167
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:27,310
I just got my chiropractor license.

1168
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,490
Yeah!

1169
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,070
Guys, I'm a licensed chiropractor.

1170
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,370
Oh my god.

1171
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,450
Did you guys ever see the YouTube video of chiropractors for dogs?

1172
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,290
And I'm just like how...

1173
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,730
That's like the scariest shit ever.

1174
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,750
Doing chiro...

1175
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,070
Fucking...

1176
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,310
Fucking doing that to dogs?

1177
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,070
Please...

1178
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,550
Guys, I'm like that...

1179
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,950
I'm like that guy in Gumball where he has...

1180
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,730
When he's like everywhere because he has so many jobs and licenses.

1181
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,250
That's me.

1182
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,170
That's me.

1183
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,110
I gotta make money somehow.

1184
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,330
Okay.

1185
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:03,750
Please.

1186
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,950
Please just let me poke you in the back!

1187
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,710
Oh god.

1188
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,190
Oh my god.

1189
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,450
I don't know why he doesn't like it.

1190
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,810
It's like a little scratch.

1191
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,550
Okay.

1192
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,170
Alright, one... two more stabs maybe.

1193
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,110
Please, please, please.

1194
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,390
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1195
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,290
Okay, what if I just stand here like this?

1196
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:25,850
Okay.

1197
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,290
Sorry, I recharged it a little.

1198
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,490
It's okay.

1199
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,370
I'll just stand here like this.

1200
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:29,670
What?

1201
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,050
No!

1202
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:30,450
No!

1203
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:31,630
No!

1204
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:33,250
No!

1205
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,970
I have to do it again!

1206
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,250
Oh god.

1207
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,030
Oh, please get up.

1208
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,330
Why is your recovery rate so bad?

1209
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,090
Truly the chastisement of the YouTuber.

1210
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,590
Thank you for the super chat cast.

1211
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,210
Thank you.

1212
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:47,790
Thank you.

1213
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,850
How is your recovery rate this bad?

1214
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:52,930
Alright.

1215
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,490
Can you jump here?

1216
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,170
I'm gonna do it again.

1217
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,590
Where did I leave my fucking stick though?

1218
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,170
Oh no.

1219
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,610
I don't know where I left my stick.

1220
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:08,150
Alright.

1221
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,170
Can you jump over here?

1222
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,710
Can you get here?

1223
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,030
Where is he?

1224
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:17,850
Where did he go?

1225
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,010
Sir?

1226
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,630
Where did he go?

1227
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,670
Did I fall down again?

1228
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:25,610
I fucking...

1229
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,850
God damn it.

1230
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:27,190
Ha!

1231
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,910
Where did he go?

1232
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,270
Where did he go?

1233
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,270
Oh!

1234
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,310
He's behind me, isn't he?

1235
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,210
Oh shit!

1236
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,090
Okay.

1237
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,670
Guys, he was behind me.

1238
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,110
How do I get up?

1239
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,630
How do I get up?

1240
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,250
He got bored.

1241
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,090
But how do I...

1242
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,830
Oh god, please don't slap me.

1243
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:50,630
Please don't slap me.

1244
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,530
Please don't slap me.

1245
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,090
Oh!

1246
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:55,970
It's okay.

1247
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,570
It's okay.

1248
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,830
We're gonna figure this out.

1249
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:58,550
Get up.

1250
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,210
Oh, my god.

1251
00:44:59,210 --> 00:44:59,890
Get up.

1252
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:00,570
Oh!

1253
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,990
It's okay.

1254
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,810
You can't kill me.

1255
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,450
What doesn't kill me?

1256
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,910
Make me stronger!

1257
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,710
Oh!

1258
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,430
No!

1259
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,130
No!

1260
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,870
It's okay.

1261
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,810
I'm okay, guys.

1262
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,550
I'm okay.

1263
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,470
How do I get back up?

1264
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,590
Jesus Christ.

1265
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,730
How do I get back up?

1266
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,830
Do you know where the exit is?

1267
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,550
Oh, my...

1268
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,200
Please!

1269
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,320
Sir, can you get downstairs?

1270
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:34,800
Oh, no.

1271
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:34,900
I'm sorry.

1272
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:34,920
I'm sorry.

1273
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,560
Oh, my god.

1274
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,280
There must be a way.

1275
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,120
There must be a way.

1276
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,540
Oh!

1277
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,380
Fuck!

1278
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:41,740
Okay.

1279
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,680
I did not mean to.

1280
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,260
I don't know, guys.

1281
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,640
I don't know how to get back up.

1282
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,460
I don't know how to get back onto his back, guys.

1283
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,740
Maybe he'll...

1284
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,940
Oh, I have an idea.

1285
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,620
Watch this.

1286
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,180
Watch this.

1287
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,460
He's gonna be so confused.

1288
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,320
There's no way.

1289
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,780
There's no way.

1290
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,260
He's gonna go right here and then I can be like...

1291
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,540
Oh!

1292
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,420
What the...

1293
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:04,900
What the...

1294
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,160
Insert the shield.

1295
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,060
Oh!

1296
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,160
Of course, it works.

1297
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,560
I planned it all along.

1298
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,840
Guys, of course that works.

1299
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,920
I always knew it was gonna work.

1300
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,040
I'm a licensed professional.

1301
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,220
Oh, my...

1302
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:20,580
Please!

1303
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,420
Why is this so...

1304
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,920
Why is he so difficult?

1305
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,200
All right.

1306
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,780
Nice turn.

1307
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:27,980
Again.

1308
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,860
Okay.

1309
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,620
We're almost there.

1310
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,820
We just need two more pokes.

1311
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,020
Sir, calm down.

1312
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,540
Calm down!

1313
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:34,900
Sir, calm down.

1314
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,260
It doesn't hurt too bad!

1315
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,060
That's not play!

1316
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,540
You just have so much stress on your back!

1317
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,360
Please!

1318
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,900
We just need to hear a good crack!

1319
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,640
There we go.

1320
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,440
He don't wanna die.

1321
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,420
He's not gonna die!

1322
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,820
I'm a licensed professional!

1323
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,590
Die, guys!

1324
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,510
He's not a licensed professional!

1325
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,330
We're back!

1326
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,790
Another client satisfied!

1327
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:12,990
Another client satisfied!

1328
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,270
Yeah, have you guys seen the chiropractor for dogs?

1329
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:16,530
Yeah, have you guys seen the chiropractor for dogs?

1330
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,190
It's actually crazy.

1331
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:23,150
You can hear it crack while he tries to break the dog's back.

1332
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:23,550
You can hear it crack while he tries to break the dog's back.

1333
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,790
Well, he's not breaking the dog's back, but it's so disturbing.

1334
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,230
Cause it's like, how do you know if they like it?

1335
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:38,000
Like how do you know they actually like that?

1336
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,440
They can't verbally tell you, be like, ow, that is not helping.

1337
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,740
That's the neat part, they don't.

1338
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,890
Just ask the dog.

1339
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:02,230
Hey little doggy, was that a happy yelp or a not happy yelp?

1340
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,430
You guys never seen it?

1341
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,370
Okay, wait, I'm gonna find that YouTube video.

1342
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:19,450
Paradise floats upon the lake, aside- no, it's gonna be water again.

1343
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:23,210
No,

1344
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,830
not the water, colossus.

1345
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,010
I think that's the worst one.

1346
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,110
The water ones are the worst.

1347
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:39,250
The water ones and the ones that had to do with the horse.

1348
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,710
Because I'm not very good at driving horses.

1349
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,270
Gary, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1350
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,430
Man, Doki got beat up for real, for real.

1351
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,310
I know, I was just trying to help.

1352
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,370
I can't believe it, they don't trust professionals.

1353
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:57,570
Okay, chiropractor for animal- for dogs.

1354
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,070
I saw it on Twitter and I was like...

1355
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,830
Oh my god, bro, some of them- he does it to tiny dogs too.

1356
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,970
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1357
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,710
And you can see the dogs are like, what the fuck?

1358
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,310
Oh my god, the one with the corky.

1359
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,330
The cork is like, Jesus Christ.

1360
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,790
I'm trying to find the one with like...

1361
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,150
Um...

1362
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,830
The one where he was like...

1363
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,930
He like hugged the dog and he was like...

1364
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,090
I'm like...

1365
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,930
I think it was this one.

1366
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:41,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1367
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,510
Yeah, it was this one.

1368
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,310
Check this video out.

1369
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,030
The corky was like, no.

1370
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,190
Oh my god.

1371
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,430
The one where he like fucking- it's like a wrestling move.

1372
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,050
Where he like picks up the dog underneath the armpits.

1373
00:49:59,090 --> 00:49:59,630
And he's like...

1374
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,350
I'm like, what the fuck?

1375
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,070
I don't know, they're like, it improves the standard of living.

1376
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,870
I'm like, but you don't even know what- if they're- they can't talk.

1377
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,610
I'm just like, how do you- how do you know?

1378
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,350
Snap, crackle, and pop.

1379
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,630
Am I right, chat?

1380
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,570
Plastic, thank you for the magenta soup.

1381
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,130
Thank you, thank you.

1382
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,890
Alright, let me...

1383
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,410
Let me...

1384
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,810
Pray real fast.

1385
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,790
They looked relaxed.

1386
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:44,290
I just wondered like, how do you trial and error it correctly?

1387
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,890
To become a professional too.

1388
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:52,190
Cause it's like, dog skeletons are not the same as human skeletons.

1389
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:58,370
So I'm just like, how- they all just all look very- yeah cause they're like, what the fuck?

1390
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,630
That dog is like- they're like, what the fuck is this person doing?

1391
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,350
And then like, suddenly their bones feel different?

1392
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:09,370
Like...

1393
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,010
Oh my god.

1394
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,690
That sounds like- that's so fucking freaky.

1395
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,290
It's like, oh my god.

1396
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:27,270
Like, how we invent stuff, you don't think like, how long it took for us to invent.

1397
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,610
Okay, this is fucked up for me to say.

1398
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:34,350
But it's like, when did we figure out how to- Neutering sucks!

1399
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,690
It's like, it's similar!

1400
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,610
It's similar, the trial and error.

1401
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:52,510
When did we figure out what- how- how- how neutering works?

1402
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,410
It's- oh, then stop smiling after.

1403
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,270
How long did it take?

1404
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,570
Same with poison!

1405
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,670
The fact that we know what's poisonous and what's not.

1406
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:10,470
Like, you have to remember how many times it take us to like, figure out which mushrooms we can eat and which we can't.

1407
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:15,650
Cause like, there's like mushrooms that look the same to each other and then...

1408
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:21,990
And then we have to like, figure out what mushroom was like, poisonous and which one wasn't.

1409
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,850
There's some hilarious- yeah, they're like, what the fuck?

1410
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,290
As soon as they crack the body, they're like, the fuck?

1411
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,290
Alright, we go...

1412
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,650
Is this the water?

1413
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:37,010
Is the water there?

1414
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,930
Wait, is it underneath here?

1415
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,050
It's like how like, back in the medieval times, there would be poison testers.

1416
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,030
We know- yeah, exactly.

1417
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,890
Experience, not our experience.

1418
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,970
Oh no, not the wad.

1419
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,670
We gotta find- how many lakes are here?

1420
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,990
Alright, we gotta find another lake.

1421
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,850
We gotta find another lake, chat.

1422
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,770
It's a never ending cycle of lakes.

1423
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,030
We're never- oh my god, please.

1424
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,190
Arlo, please.

1425
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,150
Arlo, please.

1426
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:13,470
Find me a lake.

1427
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,690
Alright, here you go.

1428
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,330
Alright, here you go.

1429
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,390
Salute to all those dogs we've tested to perfect.

1430
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,510
Salute to the falls.

1431
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,130
There you go.

1432
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,910
This way.

1433
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,630
This has to be where the lake is.

1434
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,840
Is this the lake?

1435
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,020
This has to be.

1436
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,960
There's water here.

1437
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,340
Okay, how do I get down here?

1438
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,000
Okay, can I die from this lake?

1439
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,540
There's no way.

1440
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,560
There's no way I'll die from this lake, right?

1441
00:53:59,560 --> 00:53:59,680
Right?

1442
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,340
No, that seems like a pretty deep lake.

1443
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:02,800
Nevermind.

1444
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,180
I mean that's...

1445
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,900
Okay.

1446
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,100
Is it this lake?

1447
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,720
Is it this one?

1448
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,820
Is this the lake?

1449
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,040
Not this one?

1450
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:12,920
God.

1451
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,780
God, there's way too many lakes.

1452
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,640
Oh, is it this one?

1453
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,460
It has to be this lake.

1454
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,260
I don't like it down though.

1455
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,260
Is it this lake?

1456
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,920
It's pointing there.

1457
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,420
How many other lakes are there?

1458
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,240
This has to be the only lake.

1459
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,120
The bridge?

1460
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,580
Oh, okay.

1461
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,240
You're right.

1462
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,040
There is a bridge there.

1463
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,480
Jump.

1464
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,300
Do it, Doki.

1465
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,180
You'll be so funny.

1466
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,560
Alright, we're gonna go to that bridge.

1467
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,800
It has to be the bridge over there.

1468
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,100
I've never like...

1469
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,680
I don't know.

1470
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,920
Has anyone ever went to a chiropractor before?

1471
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,920
It's always so scary whenever I see videos of people doing chiropractor.

1472
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,720
Like, what is it called?

1473
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,640
Chiro... chiro...

1474
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,760
What is the verb?

1475
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,560
Whenever someone went to get chiropracted, it wants to work for it.

1476
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,660
Chiropractor?

1477
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,100
Chiropracted?

1478
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,080
Like, it's always so scary because...

1479
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,860
Because it's like they pull...

1480
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:25,000
Like, there's ones where they pull your neck up and stuff.

1481
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,300
And then you hear a fucking crack.

1482
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,280
I'm like, Jesus Christ.

1483
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,200
Like, it just looks painful in a way to...

1484
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,100
That like scares the shit out of me.

1485
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,660
They just call it chiropractice?

1486
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,900
I don't know.

1487
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,500
Like, the fact that your entire body is like...

1488
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,380
You know...

1489
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,900
What if they...

1490
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,240
Sorry, I might be giving people internal fears right now.

1491
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,420
And like never go to chiropractice or anything because of what I'm saying.

1492
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,340
But like...

1493
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,200
But what if like...

1494
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,080
It's just weird because they're like putting their entire body...

1495
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,560
And you just hear like crack sound and shit like that.

1496
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,840
That's so fucking scary to me.

1497
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,720
You are.

1498
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,060
Just like me in planes.

1499
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,440
Please, why don't you...

1500
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,320
Arlo, why aren't you going?

1501
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,300
Oh my God, I'm just gonna walk over.

1502
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,920
God damn it, Arlo.

1503
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,300
He doesn't like the fucking water stream.

1504
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,320
And I don't know why.

1505
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,200
I don't know why.

1506
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,140
I don't know why.

1507
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:27,320
I don't know why he's here.

1508
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,900
Can I jump down?

1509
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,720
Guys, we cannot jump down.

1510
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,420
Do not.

1511
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,960
Do not jump down.

1512
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,520
But where do I go?

1513
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,780
Where the fuck do I go?

1514
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,070
Where the fuck is that bridge?

1515
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,550
It's not here.

1516
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,470
Maybe the other side?

1517
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:51,890
Do a flip.

1518
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:53,590
Guys, I'm not gonna try.

1519
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,050
Guys, I don't wanna walk back down.

1520
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,630
Doki, don't worry.

1521
00:56:58,690 --> 00:56:59,930
You can make that jump.

1522
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,610
You totally can.

1523
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:02,710
Guys, I don't know.

1524
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:07,110
Whenever you guys say do it, for some reason, I feel like I can't.

1525
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,630
Trial and error, Doki.

1526
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:12,890
Remember what you said.

1527
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,030
This is not the same thing and you know it.

1528
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,390
This is not the same.

1529
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,990
It has to be here.

1530
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:22,690
You can?

1531
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,030
Not with that attitude?

1532
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,790
Don't do it.

1533
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:28,490
Don't do it.

1534
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,410
Guys, I'm getting like different...

1535
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,990
I'm getting like conflicting answers here.

1536
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,550
Is it not here?

1537
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,410
Where is my light telling me to go?

1538
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,170
There's literally a sun.

1539
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,010
Where is my...

1540
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,570
It's like here.

1541
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,530
It's in there?

1542
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,630
How the fuck do I get in there?

1543
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,330
There's no way.

1544
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,270
I cannot even see the end.

1545
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:59,590
The waterfall just stops watering.

1546
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,070
Like...

1547
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,710
It doesn't even head downstairs.

1548
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,490
It just stops.

1549
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,340
Like what?

1550
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,840
Why did it stop?

1551
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,860
There has to be like a cave, right?

1552
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,080
Where the lake came from?

1553
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,340
Right?

1554
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,700
There has to be.

1555
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,000
Well, nope.

1556
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,980
That's where the lake is.

1557
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,400
Oh my god.

1558
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,480
I'm so lost, Arlo.

1559
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,900
I'm so...

1560
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,880
It doesn't...

1561
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,580
It doesn't even head downstairs.

1562
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:38,880
Okay.

1563
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,160
How much money would you guys bet on it?

1564
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,300
If you bet money on it...

1565
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,820
Are you right?

1566
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,180
Wait, wait.

1567
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,920
There's a hole here.

1568
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,040
There's a hole here.

1569
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,420
Guys.

1570
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,360
Guys, there's an extra hole.

1571
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,800
Wait, maybe it's here.

1572
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,700
There's an extra hole here that I didn't go through.

1573
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,700
Look how Arlo is just trailing behind me.

1574
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,860
Wait, have I been here?

1575
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,720
That's a shrine, right?

1576
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,260
I think I've been here before.

1577
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,820
There's a shrine right here.

1578
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,340
Have I been here before?

1579
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,340
This has to be it, right?

1580
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,380
Oh no, this is where I came from.

1581
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:17,840
Guys, sorry.

1582
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,740
This is...

1583
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,300
Sorry, my GPS malfunctioned there.

1584
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,920
This is exactly where I've been.

1585
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,840
Deja vu, guys.

1586
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,800
Deja vu.

1587
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,100
Oh my god.

1588
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,840
Where the fuck do I go?

1589
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,200
Like, it's just empty.

1590
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,440
It's just nowhere.

1591
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,200
Is there a bridge there?

1592
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,880
There has to be like a bridge somewhere.

1593
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,900
It can't just be like nothing.

1594
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,460
Why would there be a cliff here?

1595
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,400
Why the fuck?

1596
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,240
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

1597
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,200
I don't know.

1598
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,200
For some reason, the main character is so scared.

1599
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,580
And I don't know why.

1600
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,480
Guys, why does he seem so scared about jumping down, guys?

1601
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,540
Why does...

1602
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,140
Unless it's not the right way.

1603
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:13,960
Better.

1604
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1605
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:15,660
Thank you.

1606
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:15,860
Thank you.

1607
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,360
Thank you.

1608
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,880
Thank you.

1609
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1610
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:20,860
Thank you.

1611
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,300
Thank you.

1612
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,180
I did.

1613
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,780
I followed the water.

1614
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,920
There was like multiple waters.

1615
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,380
Follow...

1616
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:30,940
I did.

1617
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
This is it.

1618
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,740
They won't let me go forward.

1619
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,900
Okay, I'll find...

1620
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,920
I'll follow this trail of water.

1621
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,860
Where does this trail of water lead me?

1622
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,520
Oh, nowhere?

1623
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,000
Oh, nothing?

1624
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,240
Look at that.

1625
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:53,840
Nothing!

1626
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,240
It just leads me to this.

1627
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,480
Which is nothing.

1628
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,160
Check the map.

1629
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,300
I am checking the map.

1630
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,400
What am I looking at?

1631
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,620
Try the other water.

1632
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,760
There was nothing here!

1633
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,060
It's nothing!

1634
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,520
Okay, climb it.

1635
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:21,780
Climb what?

1636
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,280
Climb what?

1637
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,220
The fucking air?

1638
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,420
Guys.

1639
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,900
Wait, what the fuck is this?

1640
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,260
Oh, okay, I got like a token.

1641
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,420
Guys, I got an easter egg.

1642
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,120
Was that it?

1643
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,840
That opening over there!

1644
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,800
It's right there, Doki!

1645
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,480
God, open your eyes!

1646
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,520
Alright, we're gonna go check the other fucking opening then.

1647
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,280
Guys, the next opening is the fucking waterfall!

1648
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,760
That's another waterfall!

1649
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,820
What do you mean there?

1650
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,080
It's literally water!

1651
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,020
It's right there, Doki!

1652
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,720
It's right there!

1653
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,740
Oh my god, circle emoji!

1654
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,780
Right there!

1655
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,500
You just ran past it again, Doki!

1656
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,900
Oh my god, stop running past it!

1657
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,220
Follow the water, not on the water.

1658
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,640
Oh my god, how many waters do I follow?

1659
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,860
Fine, I'm gonna follow the water again!

1660
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,560
I'm following the water!

1661
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,220
I'm following it!

1662
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:45,860
Woah!

1663
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,880
Where is this water gonna take me?

1664
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,640
Woah!

1665
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,300
Oh my god!

1666
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,040
Water?

1667
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,020
Right here?

1668
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,360
Woah!

1669
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,260
There's like no holes here either.

1670
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,500
Am I even in the right hole?

1671
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,960
Like, am I supposed to be here?

1672
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,500
Like...

1673
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,060
This is insane.

1674
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:16,260
Guys, I swear to fucking god, am I actually not missing it?

1675
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:23,280
Am I... Am I... Am I like actually like too blind to see the fucking hole?

1676
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:24,720
Like...

1677
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:30,880
There's no way there's actually a hole here that I'm missing.

1678
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,180
I refuse to believe I'm actually missing something.

1679
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:39,140
It's hard to find the hole.

1680
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,900
There's a road that follows... Is this not the road?

1681
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,800
Is this... There's other holes?

1682
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,180
Where do the... Where are the other holes?

1683
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,100
Oh my god, go back.

1684
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,040
This is what we call the river.

1685
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,560
Alright, alright.

1686
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,780
Let's see.

1687
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,640
Chat GPS.

1688
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,400
Let's go.

1689
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,420
It's like Chat GPT, but like more confusing apparently.

1690
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,400
Alright, here we go.

1691
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,620
Wait, is that a hole?

1692
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:17,700
Right here?

1693
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,200
No, that's just the water.

1694
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,560
That's not the hole.

1695
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,860
Alright, we're following the river!

1696
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,600
We're following the river!

1697
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,400
See the open... That way?

1698
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,220
There's an opening?

1699
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,940
I think, yeah, we hundred percent need yellow paint.

1700
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,260
What opening?

1701
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:46,440
Leave the woods where you came in and follow... There's more to the canyon?!

1702
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,380
Was I not even supposed to be in the fucking forest?

1703
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,480
Oh my fucking god, oh I'm leaving.

1704
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,040
Apparently, I'm not even supposed to be in this forest, guys.

1705
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,200
I can't... Guys, that's all you have to say, leave the...

1706
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,780
Leave the forest?

1707
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,740
Guys, you could have said leave the fucking forest.

1708
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,200
Chat, that's all you had to say.

1709
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,060
I would have left the forest.

1710
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,100
There you go.

1711
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:16,980
There's the hole.

1712
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,240
I found the hole, guys.

1713
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:21,420
Guys, I figured it out.

1714
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,540
I left the goddamn fucking forest.

1715
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,220
And then there's another area.

1716
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,740
Guys, who would have thought there was more to life than the fucking forest?

1717
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,920
There it is.

1718
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,400
Alright.

1719
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,240
We did it.

1720
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,220
We figured it out, guys.

1721
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,680
Guys, I don't know why none of you guys said leave the fucking forest.

1722
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:53,200
Why did all of you make me go with... Why did all of you fucking say follow the river?

1723
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,180
A whole new hole.

1724
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,860
But we had a good time at the forest.

1725
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,460
We could have left the forest, guys.

1726
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,480
We didn't have to be in the forest.

1727
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,820
Alright, here we go.

1728
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,060
Can't believe some of you guys were like, just jump.

1729
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,480
I'm not gonna... Guys, I would jump only if the safe spot...

1730
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:17,600
Wait.

1731
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,900
He has a white tail.

1732
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,500
Oh, it's because this is the shrine!

1733
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,420
I was like, wait, where's the shrine for this?

1734
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,160
Alright.

1735
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,740
Time to burn that forest down.

1736
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,700
The less forest there are, the less I'll get lost.

1737
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:34,540
Guys, for legal reasons, that is a joke.

1738
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,780
I used to be president of the environmental club.

1739
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,180
I would never willingly burn the forest down.

1740
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:41,860
Woop.

1741
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,580
There you go.

1742
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:43,840
Where is he?

1743
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,480
Is he still alive?

1744
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,100
Oh, he is.

1745
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,260
Not anymore.

1746
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,480
Wait, what?

1747
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:50,900
Oh yeah, he's dead.

1748
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,600
Not anymore.

1749
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,600
God, good.

1750
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,420
More stamina.

1751
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:56,780
Alright, here.

1752
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,380
Woop.

1753
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,100
There you go.

1754
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,520
Woop, I got down.

1755
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:02,900
Sorry.

1756
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,500
There we go.

1757
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,020
Now!

1758
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,200
This has to be the lake.

1759
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,300
Oh my god, there's the lake!

1760
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,920
How the fuck do I get into the lake?

1761
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,380
Oh, I have to climb.

1762
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,600
Okay.

1763
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:15,380
Alright.

1764
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,400
Don't worry, Arlo.

1765
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,160
You can swim too, Arlo, right?

1766
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,900
Arlo, just do the jump!

1767
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,060
It'll be so funny!

1768
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:22,860
Arlo!

1769
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,740
It'll be so funny if you make that jump!

1770
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,480
You have more momentum!

1771
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,660
We actually made it to the lake.

1772
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,020
Oh, thank fucking god.

1773
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,180
We made it.

1774
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,140
Holy shit.

1775
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,280
There's way too many lakes in this area.

1776
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:43,540
There's way too many fucking lakes, guys.

1777
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,220
Alright.

1778
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,060
Down I go.

1779
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:47,560
Yay!

1780
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,800
He has to be here, right?

1781
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,060
Alright.

1782
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,720
Is it faster if I swim underwater?

1783
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,640
It is, right?

1784
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,700
Sorry, I can hold my breath for a long time.

1785
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:03,840
The more salamander tails you eat, the longer you can hold your breath.

1786
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,420
Real.

1787
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,580
I learned this in a video game.

1788
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,200
Guys, every time...

1789
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,980
Because we all know, video games are so real.

1790
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,500
Where is he?

1791
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,120
Where is this monster?

1792
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,700
Ooh, why is there like three podiums there?

1793
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:23,580
Yeah!

1794
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,460
Of course!

1795
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,020
I eat those salamander tails.

1796
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,280
Trust me, guys.

1797
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,780
I'm thinking...

1798
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:31,320
Like...

1799
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,160
Can salamander tails be food?

1800
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:34,600
Because like...

1801
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,620
It's like an infinite food glitch, you know?

1802
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,300
You get a bunch of salamanders and like...

1803
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,120
You know, they can regrow their tails, right?

1804
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,600
So like all you...

1805
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,260
I feel like if I had this conversation...

1806
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,940
I feel like I've had this conversation before.

1807
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,780
But...

1808
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,880
But like think about it.

1809
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,640
Like...

1810
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,680
Because like the tails are still meat, you know?

1811
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:56,900
So like...

1812
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,340
What if you just...

1813
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:58,960
You just...

1814
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,640
You just like farm a bunch of salamanders...

1815
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,680
And then...

1816
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,600
And then all you do is just, you know...

1817
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,420
Every time you're hungry, you eat the salamander tail and then...

1818
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,740
Wait for it to regrow and then...

1819
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:12,660
But then you have like a farm of them.

1820
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,860
And they just...

1821
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,220
They don't always grow back.

1822
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,280
Then you just kill it!

1823
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,220
It's...

1824
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,040
We're back to selective breeding!

1825
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:20,980
Like...

1826
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,480
We evolve...

1827
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,460
Oh shit, that guy's cool.

1828
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:30,260
We evolve the ones that like...

1829
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,120
That grow their tails faster!

1830
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,600
Okay, we keep them on the farm.

1831
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,140
It's like the whole grass thing again.

1832
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,960
Oh shit!

1833
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,400
Ow!

1834
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:42,800
That hurt!

1835
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,580
But he has electricity and water?

1836
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,460
Oh my god!

1837
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,480
That's fucked up!

1838
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,060
Why do you have electricity power?

1839
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:52,620
It's fucked up!

1840
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,780
You're just gonna like electrocute yourself!

1841
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,900
Oh god, okay.

1842
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,680
Okay, he doesn't see me.

1843
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:58,940
He can't.

1844
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,060
This is not realistic.

1845
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:03,280
I should have been electrified as well as all the fish around me.

1846
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,200
No, all I'm saying is infinite food glitch.

1847
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,200
Just think about it.

1848
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,740
It's literally an infinite food glitch because they can grow back their tails.

1849
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,680
So like if you're hungry, you just eat the tails and they're still alive.

1850
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,980
They're still alive, right?

1851
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:18,640
So...

1852
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,160
Oh my god.

1853
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,680
Please for the love of god!

1854
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,400
Where can I climb you?

1855
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,220
Where can I climb you?

1856
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,440
Stop following me!

1857
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:30,420
Okay.

1858
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,540
Oh, this is not fair because he turns faster than me swimming.

1859
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,060
Like how the fuck am I supposed to figure this out?

1860
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,600
Yeah, we feed them bugs!

1861
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,160
Bugs reproduce so fast!

1862
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,300
Some of them eat bugs, right?

1863
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,460
So like...

1864
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,040
Oh god, okay.

1865
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,340
So like all we do is we...

1866
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,220
Oh wait, I see it.

1867
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:51,620
I see it.

1868
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,140
It's his tail.

1869
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:52,380
Oh my god.

1870
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,100
It's his tail.

1871
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:53,640
My tail theory.

1872
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,420
It's the tail theory, guys.

1873
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,080
All over again.

1874
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,300
Okay.

1875
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,960
It's the tail theory.

1876
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,480
We climbed the tail.

1877
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,120
Oh my god.

1878
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:05,420
Please for the love of god.

1879
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,340
Maybe I'll swim faster than the weight.

1880
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,320
Maybe if I swim faster, it'll work.

1881
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:13,880
Oh my god.

1882
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,380
I fucking knew it's the tail.

1883
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,920
All right, here you go.

1884
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,420
Here you go.

1885
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,000
I knew it.

1886
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,560
I knew it was going to be the tail.

1887
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,360
It's always the tail.

1888
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:22,380
That's true.

1889
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,120
It's just the theory.

1890
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:23,960
Tail theory.

1891
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,120
Oh, I'm seeing.

1892
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,280
Like salamanders, they just eat bugs, right?

1893
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,600
And bugs reproduce crazy fucking fast.

1894
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:35,200
So like if you're hungry, give the salamander bugs and then...

1895
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:35,400
What?

1896
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:36,880
Where is it?

1897
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,740
Where the fuck is it?

1898
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,600
Why does he have like teeth on his head?

1899
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,160
Where do I take him?

1900
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:48,540
Why is he at like...

1901
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,060
What?

1902
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,260
Why is there teeth on his head?

1903
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,360
That's not where you're supposed to go.

1904
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,860
Why do you have teeth on your head?

1905
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,140
Oh god.

1906
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:55,600
Oh god.

1907
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,920
No shit.

1908
01:11:59,100 --> 01:11:59,820
Oh shit!

1909
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,340
Okay.

1910
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,760
Oh, that's gotta hurt if you hit the tooth straight on.

1911
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,460
Oh, I can steer it!

1912
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,460
Like a steering wheel!

1913
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,600
It's like my very own car.

1914
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,720
Bro, this is better than a horse.

1915
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,020
Although I don't mean it.

1916
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,460
You know that because I still need you.

1917
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,360
You know I don't mean it.

1918
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,380
It's like a xylophone teeth.

1919
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:21,780
I don't know.

1920
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,160
I don't want to do this.

1921
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,620
Can I like take him to like the other claw?

1922
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,300
I assume I have to go here, right?

1923
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,120
Like where else would I fucking go?

1924
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,360
Now I'm a dent...

1925
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,240
Guys, now I'm a licensed dentist now.

1926
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,920
Guys, I'm here to...

1927
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,100
Look at all these cavities!

1928
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:38,800
Bro!

1929
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,360
You need a dentures!

1930
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,180
Or braces!

1931
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,000
Honestly, you definitely need braces.

1932
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,600
This tooth is like so fucking overgrown.

1933
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,500
Like holy shit.

1934
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,480
You 100% need a fucking dentist.

1935
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,600
What do I do?

1936
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:51,860
I'm gonna go to the dentist.

1937
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:53,440
I'm up here now.

1938
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,280
Hello?

1939
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:57,000
Hello?

1940
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:00,820
Hello?

1941
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,220
What do I do?

1942
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:03,380
Hello?

1943
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:05,080
I'm here.

1944
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,300
What are you doing?

1945
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,920
Oh, what are you doing?

1946
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:08,780
Oh my god!

1947
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,220
You're giving me your belly?

1948
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,900
What do I do here?

1949
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,520
Oh!

1950
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,940
Oh my god!

1951
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,260
Okay guys, he needs a belly rub.

1952
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:19,900
Isn't that cute?

1953
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,620
Guys, he needs a little belly rub here.

1954
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:26,380
Don't worry.

1955
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,360
Those juices are just all the oil from excitement.

1956
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,120
Oh shit!

1957
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:32,620
Fuck!

1958
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:32,900
Okay.

1959
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,340
Don't worry, I'm okay.

1960
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,040
I'm okay guys.

1961
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,260
I'm okay.

1962
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,580
I just gave him a little belly rub and he got a little too excited.

1963
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,300
Guys, come on.

1964
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:47,920
Let me through.

1965
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,240
Let me through.

1966
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,700
It's like a dentist, like... Okay, if a dentist gives you belly rub, that is not a licensed dentist.

1967
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,160
Just saying.

1968
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,600
But I'm different.

1969
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,100
I'm different.

1970
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:58,720
I'm a specialist.

1971
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:10,980
If a dentist, after your procedure, tries to give you belly rubs, I don't think that's a real dentist guys.

1972
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:11,880
I think... I think...

1973
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,200
I think you might... I think you might got scammed.

1974
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,300
Unless... Unless it's jokey.

1975
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,400
Unless it's jokey.

1976
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,100
I'm a specialist.

1977
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,080
It's like my thing.

1978
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:26,100
It's like, you know, children dentists where like, there's dentists that are just primarily for kids.

1979
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,100
And they have these like weird ass offices.

1980
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,400
Like, kid themed dentist offices.

1981
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,020
I was watching a video where there was a dentist...

1982
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:38,320
There was a dentist that specializes on just children.

1983
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,700
And then, the thing is like, their entire office...

1984
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,680
Was like, they have an elevator in their office.

1985
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,940
Like, in the procedure room to entertain kids.

1986
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,360
And I'm like, Jesus fucking...

1987
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,600
Like, they have an actual like, mini elevator.

1988
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:55,820
Where...

1989
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,480
Where they do like, some Willy Wonka shit.

1990
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,680
Some Willy Wonka shit to like, make the kids feel comfortable.

1991
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:06,320
But it's still like, fucking crazy.

1992
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,420
Oh god.

1993
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,200
Oh...

1994
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:10,340
Oh...

1995
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,980
Sir, I know you have...

1996
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,420
You gotta stop eating candy!

1997
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,620
Look at your overgrown teeth!

1998
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,460
It's like they're...

1999
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:18,860
Oh!

2000
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,680
Okay, I'm okay.

2001
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,360
I didn't...

2002
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,800
I didn't ply anything.

2003
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,940
Alright, here we go.

2004
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,440
And climb.

2005
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:34,820
That was close.

2006
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,640
I'm holding on for dear life right now.

2007
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,760
I don't know what you're talking about, guys.

2008
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

2009
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,720
This is how dentists works.

2010
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,340
You guys might not know, because you don't see your own mouth.

2011
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,440
This is what the dentist looks like when you're fixing...

2012
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,240
When they're fixing your teeth.

2013
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:56,080
You just smack it until something happens.

2014
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:57,380
Jesus Christ.

2015
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,240
Turn around.

2016
01:15:59,040 --> 01:15:59,840
Keep turning.

2017
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,980
Who keeps hitting my cavities?

2018
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,360
This is why they put like, those...

2019
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,200
Those like, anesthesia...

2020
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:09,900
No, not anesthesia.

2021
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,180
What are those things that make your fucking mouth numb?

2022
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,640
This is what they do.

2023
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,660
You just whack it.

2024
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:22,240
I love my Eldritch Horror Dentist area.

2025
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,820
That should be it, right?

2026
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2027
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:32,490
That's fine.

2028
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:32,990
We're fine.

2029
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,530
Alright, you want a little belly rub?

2030
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,730
After getting rid of that cavity, you need that little belly rub?

2031
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:39,750
Don't worry.

2032
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:41,510
Don't worry.

2033
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:42,470
I'm a specialist.

2034
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:44,590
I'm a specialist.

2035
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:49,630
Every time I fix a teeth, I give a belly rub.

2036
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:51,310
To make you feel better.

2037
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:56,230
I wonder if dog dentists...

2038
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,030
I wonder like...

2039
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:01,930
If you get paid more to be a dog dentist than a regular dentist.

2040
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:06,470
Because like, I feel like vets can make so much more money...

2041
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:08,210
Than like, like any...

2042
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:08,490
Oh!

2043
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:08,910
No!

2044
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,930
My platform!

2045
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,470
How would I give you the belly rub?

2046
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:19,630
Ooh, tummy hurt.

2047
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:23,130
How would I give you the belly rub, sir?

2048
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:28,130
Guys, it's because I did too much of a good job.

2049
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:30,290
It's not because my belly rubs were fucking shit.

2050
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:33,790
There's another platform?

2051
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:35,050
Oh my god.

2052
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,130
I need to swim again.

2053
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,190
Swim, swim, swim.

2054
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:38,290
No.

2055
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:38,570
I need to swim more.

2056
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,030
Sir, I can't keep give...

2057
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,090
I can't give you belly rubs or you destroy my platform.

2058
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:47,470
All I'm saying is that I feel like your profession is like animal related.

2059
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:48,930
You get paid so much more.

2060
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:50,990
Only because I feel like...

2061
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,950
Because like...

2062
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:56,730
We love our pets so fucking much that we will like...

2063
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,030
Oh my god.

2064
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,470
He like...

2065
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,690
Just fixed his back too.

2066
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,890
We love our pets so much more...

2067
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:06,370
That we will spend a lot of money.

2068
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:08,570
Especially for like...

2069
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:09,410
Dog dentistry.

2070
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:12,450
There you go.

2071
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:15,230
Sir, we haven't fixed your teeth yet.

2072
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:18,210
We gotta give you braces on the head.

2073
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:19,290
Sir.

2074
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,670
How the fuck did you like...

2075
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,410
Get cavities on your head?

2076
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,510
What are you eating?

2077
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:27,850
Oh my god, please.

2078
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,250
Where's the other platform?

2079
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,210
I don't even know where the other...

2080
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:32,750
Oh, it's over there.

2081
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:33,890
It's on the right side.

2082
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:34,970
All right.

2083
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:35,970
Here you go.

2084
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:36,050
Here you go.

2085
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:39,650
We may give you adult braces.

2086
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:41,410
Don't worry.

2087
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,750
Some people are into that.

2088
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:45,970
Oh shit.

2089
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:47,010
Sorry for laughing.

2090
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,110
Down you go.

2091
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:55,150
Oops, sorry.

2092
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:55,970
I went the wrong way.

2093
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,570
My GPS isn't working.

2094
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:58,790
All right.

2095
01:18:58,830 --> 01:18:59,230
Here you go.

2096
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:00,970
Oh fuck.

2097
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:01,490
Okay, sorry.

2098
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,070
I said sorry.

2099
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:05,950
I'm sorry.

2100
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,110
Sorry for hitting the fucking gums.

2101
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,130
I said, sorry.

2102
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,010
Look, you wanted the cheap dentist.

2103
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:12,750
Okay.

2104
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:17,890
Look, you could have got a real dentist that only specialises on teeth.

2105
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:23,750
But you got the chiropractor, dentist, acupuncturist, massage parlour, and uterus.

2106
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:25,130
That's not my fault.

2107
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,230
You could have went for the real deal.

2108
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,750
I am real.

2109
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:34,970
But he could have went for the actual specialist dentist.

2110
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:41,490
I'm the one with the... being good at a lot.

2111
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:46,290
Like, being decent at a lot of things means that you're not good at one thing.

2112
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:59,070
So all I'm saying is that I might not have as much time doing head teeth versus like massage... massages.

2113
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:05,150
Jack of all trades... yeah, exactly!

2114
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:07,930
Jack of all trades, master of no... EXACTLY!

2115
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:17,910
Look, it doesn't... I might be able to have a license on all of them, but it doesn't mean I am the best at all.

2116
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:27,890
Guys... I just have a certificate.

2117
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:28,790
I like passed.

2118
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:30,690
It doesn't mean I got a good grade.

2119
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:31,770
It just means I passed.

2120
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,510
Hahaha!

2121
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:34,530
Hahaha!

2122
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:38,310
It just means like that.

2123
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:41,810
Yay!

2124
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:43,230
Another happy client!

2125
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:08,050
Speaking of cheap specialists, did you see Conan and Brian's Hot Ones episode where he brought that totally legit doctor with him?

2126
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,850
Long time.

2127
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,250
Thank you for the super chat!

2128
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:12,610
Thank you!

2129
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:13,250
Thank you!

2130
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:16,630
I wanna watch his stuff.

2131
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:20,310
He's like... he's really... I think like any comedian...

2132
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:21,990
Cause like I feel like in order to like...

2133
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:25,450
Master comedy, you have to be like really smart.

2134
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:26,130
I feel like...

2135
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:26,630
Dude, you're so easy to know.

2136
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:32,390
Like a lot of like really good... cause like it's so com... like universal comedy like things that make people...

2137
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:33,450
Who the fuck are these people?

2138
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,150
Are they trying to encroach on my territory?

2139
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:37,450
Guys, I claim this territory.

2140
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:38,410
This is my...

2141
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:42,810
Neuter massage... acupuncturist... uh... dentist area.

2142
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:44,010
I claim that.

2143
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,650
It's like... it's like gangs.

2144
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,730
Like this is my turf.

2145
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:47,910
What the fuck are you doing?

2146
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:48,970
Get out of my turf.

2147
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:59,300
But I feel like... like... cause you have to be smart to be able to... be able to write humor that's like funny.

2148
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,960
That's universally funny.

2149
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:10,780
Um... and like... especially humor that sort of transcends like... uh... transcends like... uh... language barriers.

2150
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:18,160
And like a lot of my favorite comedians... Yeah, to write good humor... A lot of my favorite comedians...

2151
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:21,840
I went to our Ivy League graduates too.

2152
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:31,060
And I feel like a good comedian actor can be an amazing...

2153
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:33,660
can be like... what is this?

2154
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,140
The Fast...

2155
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:34,380
Desert!

2156
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,400
Oh no.

2157
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,180
Not the desert.

2158
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,580
Not the fucking dry lakes.

2159
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:52,150
I feel like a lot of comedians are really good actors in general.

2160
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:57,150
Because you have to be a really good actor to make comedy movies work.

2161
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:01,630
To make a comedy movie seem natural.

2162
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:03,030
I feel like.

2163
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,350
Especially improv too.

2164
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:08,670
You have to be really smart to be able to do improv correctly.

2165
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,530
Because there can be super cringe improv.

2166
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:18,150
I feel like a lot of super good actors...

2167
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:20,230
like super good comedian actors...

2168
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,130
can actually be really good actors.

2169
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,090
In general.

2170
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:24,910
Adam Sandler, my favorite actor.

2171
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:27,330
Okay, when Adam Sandler actually does drama...

2172
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,550
He's a really good actor.

2173
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:31,770
But he just gets paid more being a comedian.

2174
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:32,930
Because he just like...

2175
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:35,810
He doesn't do indie movie films a lot.

2176
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:36,230
Or drama.

2177
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:38,250
Because indie films and movie films...

2178
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,150
don't pay as much.

2179
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,110
And because of that...

2180
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:45,050
Because of that he just does...

2181
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,290
He just does like comedies.

2182
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,770
Because he gets a bigger deal.

2183
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,710
Like gets a bigger like move...

2184
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,910
Gets a bigger pay...

2185
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:52,370
Like a bigger pay cut.

2186
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:54,010
Because if you think like...

2187
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:54,890
If you think like...

2188
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:56,690
Like the Netflix deal he had...

2189
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:58,230
That paid so much money.

2190
01:23:58,350 --> 01:23:59,090
And then you're like...

2191
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,450
Okay like that movie he did...

2192
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:00,830
A pixel.

2193
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:02,410
You know the worst fucking Adam...

2194
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,610
One of the worst fucking Adam Sandler movie of all time.

2195
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:07,150
He basically hired all his friends.

2196
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:09,710
So like that they get free paid vacation.

2197
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:17,530
He literally did that movie...

2198
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,410
So he could get like a free paid vacation.

2199
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,990
Because he doesn't care.

2200
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,610
He just wants to have like...

2201
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:25,470
He just here to fucking make money...

2202
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,690
To support his family.

2203
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:27,790
And his friends.

2204
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:30,190
Yeah all he does is just hire his friends.

2205
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:31,350
So his friends can get paid.

2206
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:32,590
And also...

2207
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,610
And also like...

2208
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,650
He can get paid as well.

2209
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:40,190
I can't forgive him for Pixar.

2210
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,490
But then when he does like drama movies...

2211
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,470
He's actually really...

2212
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,790
Like I like watched Uncut Gems.

2213
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:51,130
But I could only watch up to like...

2214
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,130
A certain point.

2215
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:53,010
Because it was just...

2216
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,410
So good.

2217
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:55,210
And like...

2218
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:55,850
It is like...

2219
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:56,870
You know when a movie is...

2220
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:58,890
Like for me when a movie is too good...

2221
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:00,090
And depressing.

2222
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:01,350
I just stop watching.

2223
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:04,190
Because I got too fucking depressed watching it.

2224
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:05,810
I was just like...

2225
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,130
Oh my god this feels too real.

2226
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,710
And then I stopped watching it.

2227
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,650
Because it was way too real.

2228
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,730
And I was like bro I'm getting really sad.

2229
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:14,070
And then I stopped.

2230
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:15,430
But it was good.

2231
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:16,910
It was a good movie.

2232
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:18,350
But like I was just...

2233
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:20,810
Super anxious watching it.

2234
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,910
Because it was so fucking high tension.

2235
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:24,410
And then...

2236
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,910
It was like super high tension.

2237
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,490
And then like super depressing.

2238
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,710
And I had to stop watching it.

2239
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:34,670
Because it was actually too good.

2240
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:39,790
But yeah.

2241
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:41,810
That's honestly what I believe.

2242
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:44,130
I feel like comedians are like...

2243
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:47,390
A lot of comedians are like comedy actors.

2244
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:51,870
And actresses are like really good at acting in general.

2245
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:55,550
Because it takes a lot of skill to make comedy movies work in general.

2246
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:58,250
Because like you gotta...

2247
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:00,210
You have to try to make it not cringe.

2248
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,850
Like what's your name?

2249
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:07,310
Is it Kate McKinnon?

2250
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:09,650
Oh my gosh.

2251
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:10,950
Where the fuck do I go?

2252
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:12,130
Where is the desert?

2253
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:15,870
Is it Kate McKinnon that...

2254
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:16,950
I'm trying to remember.

2255
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:17,870
No, not Kate McKinnon.

2256
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:18,790
There's the other one.

2257
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:19,870
The other one...

2258
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,450
Before Kate McKinnon.

2259
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:22,550
There's the other one.

2260
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:23,670
I'm trying to remember.

2261
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,230
There was this female actress.

2262
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:29,050
That's like been in a lot of comedy films.

2263
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:32,450
The wife of the guy who's in Despicable...

2264
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:35,070
Okay.

2265
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:41,330
I'm trying to remember what other role she did.

2266
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,510
But all I can remember is the wife of...

2267
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,490
Oh, Kristen Wiig!

2268
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:44,970
Yes!

2269
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:46,810
Kristen Wiig!

2270
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:48,370
Kristen Wiig!

2271
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:48,610
Kristen Wiig!

2272
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:49,770
Okay, you know Kristen Wiig?

2273
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:51,390
In a lot of like...

2274
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,630
In a lot of like comedy films.

2275
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:57,190
But she has done like some drama stuff.

2276
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,130
They're like sort of indies though.

2277
01:26:59,170 --> 01:26:59,950
They're like indie films.

2278
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:01,490
But she's such a good actress.

2279
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:02,490
I watched like...

2280
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,570
There was like one she did where she was like...

2281
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:06,290
Like pretending to...

2282
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:06,770
Like not pretending.

2283
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,950
She was like a twin sister of Bill Hader or something.

2284
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:09,770
Like that was the plot.

2285
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:10,890
And like...

2286
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,530
Also Bill Hader too.

2287
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,710
Bill Hader in that movie where he's the assassin.

2288
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:16,790
That one was really good as well.

2289
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:18,130
Not movie.

2290
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:21,710
That TV series where he was like...

2291
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:22,750
He plays an assassin.

2292
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:26,250
He's such a good actor.

2293
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,630
Barry!

2294
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:28,130
Yes!

2295
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,810
Barry!

2296
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:30,250
I love that show.

2297
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,350
That show was really good.

2298
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,990
Look, I just really love comedians.

2299
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,150
Because I think...

2300
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:39,710
I think comedians are like...

2301
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,150
Are like super talented in general.

2302
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:45,990
And a lot of them are actually like crazy smart.

2303
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,390
I think I...

2304
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:55,930
Did I not fucking ate the salamander in this one already?

2305
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:57,670
I feel like I did.

2306
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:00,570
Cause like, I don't see that salamander.

2307
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,750
Where the fuck is the sal...

2308
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:05,910
No.

2309
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:07,430
I must've eaten the salamander.

2310
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,880
Did I eat this guy already?

2311
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,660
I feel like I have the..

2312
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:19,880
I have.

2313
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,140
I don't see him.

2314
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,880
I don't hear the plip plop of his feet.

2315
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,400
I've been here?

2316
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,280
Yeah, I have.

2317
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,040
I've been here already.

2318
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:26,440
Okay.

2319
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:27,360
Yeah.

2320
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,620
Like this place has been discovered already.

2321
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,160
I don't hear the plop plop of the feet too, so I think I ate them.

2322
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,880
I ate his family already.

2323
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,100
Oh no, I'm lost now.

2324
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,140
Oh no, there's no GPS.

2325
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,520
Sun GPS, where are you when I needed you the most?

2326
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,020
Sun GPS.

2327
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,560
Where are you?

2328
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,560
Where am I?

2329
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:49,960
Sun GPS?

2330
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,620
Okay, this way.

2331
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:54,180
Okay, there's a little sun GPS right there.

2332
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,360
I think it's this way.

2333
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:57,380
Right?

2334
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:58,420
Where else can it be?

2335
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,440
Okay, a little hole.

2336
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,220
There, it's this way.

2337
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,200
I found the little hole for my sun GPS... for my sword GPS.

2338
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:08,340
It has to be this way.

2339
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,240
Where else could it be?

2340
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,380
Yeah, it's this way.

2341
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,380
Alright, we're good to go.

2342
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,400
I've been here before.

2343
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,140
No.

2344
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:22,940
This way.

2345
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:23,420
Okay.

2346
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,200
Arlo, I figured it out!

2347
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,620
Arlo, come over here!

2348
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,580
I found the exit!

2349
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:30,580
Arlo!

2350
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,440
I did it!

2351
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,940
Guys, I think... oh wait, no, I can climb up, right?

2352
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,120
Wait a minute.

2353
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:42,180
Wait a minute.

2354
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,980
Why is there no up?

2355
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:45,060
Hahaha!

2356
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:47,680
Wait a minute.

2357
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,900
Wait a minute.

2358
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,780
Why is it just tree here?

2359
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:56,720
Hahaha!

2360
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,100
Well, at least I can eat the fruit.

2361
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,220
Maybe... I'll just eat the fruit then.

2362
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:03,120
Okay, fine, right?

2363
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,060
Fruit time.

2364
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,580
Woop!

2365
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,060
Woop!

2366
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:08,920
Woop!

2367
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,060
Wait, wouldn't that like drop to the water?

2368
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:13,720
Ah!

2369
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,000
Oh yeah, it did.

2370
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:18,540
Oh, yeah, it did.

2371
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,060
Wait, how the f- oh, wait, it did.

2372
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:20,680
Okay.

2373
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:21,620
That was useless.

2374
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,480
That's... that was fucking useless.

2375
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:25,900
The fuck?

2376
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,000
How the fuck do I get up?

2377
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:32,880
Why does this lead me to nowhere?

2378
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:38,390
Why does this lead me to nowhere?

2379
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:39,890
Oh, wait, can I go up from here?

2380
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:44,330
Why does this lead me...

2381
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:44,690
Why does this lead me...

2382
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:45,050
Wait, what?

2383
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,990
Where do I go?

2384
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:51,050
Do I go down?

2385
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:51,290
Do I go down?

2386
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,910
Is that it?

2387
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:53,630
Maybe.

2388
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:57,670
There's no way it's not down, right?

2389
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:00,950
Down is up.

2390
01:31:00,970 --> 01:31:01,670
You've learned that.

2391
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:02,870
Yeah, see, I'm okay.

2392
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:05,290
Down is up.

2393
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,410
But where do I go?

2394
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:08,470
Hahaha!

2395
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:10,890
Where did that poop go?

2396
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,790
Guys, I don't know if I should have went down.

2397
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:15,690
Hahaha!

2398
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,210
Guys, I don't know.

2399
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:20,590
Where am I?

2400
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:21,330
Where am I?

2401
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,390
Where the fuck am I?

2402
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,330
Up is up?

2403
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:30,410
Guys, I don't know if down is up anymore.

2404
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:32,730
Guys, we're...

2405
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:34,870
Am I supposed to be here?

2406
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:37,190
This is the opposite of a desert.

2407
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,010
Hahaha!

2408
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:41,370
Hahaha!

2409
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:43,390
Guys, I don't know.

2410
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:45,830
This does not feel like the desert to me.

2411
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:46,970
Hahaha!

2412
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:47,190
Hahaha!

2413
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:51,530
Guys, I don't know.

2414
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:52,630
Hahaha!

2415
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:55,930
This definitely does not feel like a desert.

2416
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:56,990
Hahaha!

2417
01:31:56,990 --> 01:31:59,510
It's like here, but how do I get there?

2418
01:32:01,010 --> 01:32:01,670
Hahaha!

2419
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:02,310
Is it over there?

2420
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,240
The wet desert.

2421
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:06,130
Hahaha!

2422
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:09,830
Guys, I don't think I'm supposed to be here.

2423
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:10,410
Hahaha!

2424
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:11,050
Hahaha!

2425
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,470
Maybe I'm supposed to go here?

2426
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:15,450
Hahaha!

2427
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:18,990
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2428
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:21,270
It's on the other side.

2429
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:23,430
Did you see it?

2430
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:24,010
Hahaha!

2431
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:27,470
Hahaha!

2432
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:30,750
Am I supposed to be here?

2433
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,810
Wait, Arlo?

2434
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:33,970
Is that you, Arlo?

2435
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:34,470
What the fuck?

2436
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,070
How did you get here?

2437
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:39,550
Am I supposed to be in the wet swamps?

2438
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,830
But it said, like, desert.

2439
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:46,370
I can't tell anymore.

2440
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:46,950
I can't tell anymore.

2441
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:47,990
Hahaha!

2442
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:49,430
Hahaha!

2443
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:51,310
Hahaha!

2444
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:53,250
I can't tell.

2445
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:56,950
But, no.

2446
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,590
It's not here.

2447
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:00,470
It's past this?

2448
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,430
It's right there?

2449
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,910
Oh, there's trees though.

2450
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,850
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2451
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:10,090
Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

2452
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:10,850
Oh, God.

2453
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:11,510
Where's the sun?

2454
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,490
You need to go up.

2455
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,090
Okay, I have to go up.

2456
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,530
Was I going the right way earlier?

2457
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:18,090
Wait, is there an up here?

2458
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:19,310
Maybe there's an up here.

2459
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:22,550
This is the hardest part.

2460
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:27,830
I spend more time finding the goddamn colossi than I- Oh, wait!

2461
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:28,270
It's up here!

2462
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:28,830
Is that Kay?

2463
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,510
That's like...

2464
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:30,970
away.

2465
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:32,230
Hahaha!

2466
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:36,730
But isn't that away from the destination?

2467
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,500
I don't- Is this it?

2468
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,620
Is this the right colossi?

2469
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:52,320
Up is down, therefore wet is desert.

2470
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,380
Thank you for the super chat.

2471
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:55,160
Thank you.

2472
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:57,480
This is it?

2473
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:58,660
I'm in a cave.

2474
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,680
Keep going and stay left.

2475
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:02,460
Is this left?

2476
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:03,940
Cave.

2477
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:05,840
Maybe.

2478
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:07,160
I think I went the right way.

2479
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,200
Wait, is that desert?

2480
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:10,620
Oh my God!

2481
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,100
Down is up!

2482
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:12,740
Neat!

2483
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,480
Thank you for the feedback!

2484
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,440
I knew it!

2485
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,360
I fucking knew!

2486
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,980
I fucking knew it!

2487
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,680
Down is always- I can't believe I second guessed myself.

2488
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,640
I can't believe it!

2489
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,540
Chat, I knew my gut was right.

2490
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,260
Down is always up.

2491
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:29,780
Down is- It's never wrong!

2492
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,140
Down is up!

2493
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:36,520
Oh my God, you're a fucking genius, Doki.

2494
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,320
You always knew which way is up.

2495
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,280
You always knew.

2496
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,480
You always knew.

2497
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,400
You always knew which way was up, Doki.

2498
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,080
How does she do it?

2499
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:50,960
Where is this guy?

2500
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,620
Oh no, my son's GPS is not working right now.

2501
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,900
Where the fuck is it?

2502
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:00,340
Where the fuck is it?

2503
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:00,620
Where the fuck is it?

2504
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,980
Yeah, my son's GPS is not doing so well.

2505
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,760
Yeah, my son's GPS is not doing so well.

2506
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,020
I guess I'll go forward?

2507
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:11,200
It has to be forward, right?

2508
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,300
Where else could it be?

2509
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,020
I passed it?

2510
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,320
I passed it?

2511
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,560
How do you pass the desert?

2512
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,980
It's a fucking desert!

2513
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,800
Other way?

2514
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,520
But it's a goddamn desert!

2515
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:32,000
It's not this.

2516
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,300
Guys,

2517
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,200
it was this.

2518
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,360
Guys, apparently it was.

2519
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,780
Bro, what the fuck?

2520
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:53,720
It has like duck lips.

2521
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:56,960
Oh my God, he has like fucking...

2522
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,280
There's like air sacs on his chest.

2523
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:00,740
Like frogs.

2524
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:03,960
Like multiple balls.

2525
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:09,940
Oh no, do I need the horse for this?

2526
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:10,500
Do I need Arlo?

2527
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,860
Arlo, I've always believed in you.

2528
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:14,160
Arlo.

2529
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,180
Arlo.

2530
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,540
Please, I've always believed in you, Arlo.

2531
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:20,520
Sand bird.

2532
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,300
I feel like it's a sand frog.

2533
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,320
Because it has like those little pouches.

2534
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:29,440
It's like these little pouches on his stomach.

2535
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,080
What do I do?

2536
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,280
Do I poke his belly?

2537
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:36,820
Poke his balls?

2538
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,760
Did I hit it?

2539
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:42,440
I can't tell.

2540
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,200
Or do I actually have to steer it?

2541
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:52,540
Oh God.

2542
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,860
I hate this already.

2543
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,440
Oh yeah, they do.

2544
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,440
Some birds do.

2545
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,340
Because it's like some fucking...

2546
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,740
Like those like...

2547
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,940
Like girlfriend dances.

2548
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:08,780
Where they like puff themselves up for a female.

2549
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,940
And stuff.

2550
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,000
Shoot the pouch.

2551
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:11,340
Okay.

2552
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,700
Shoot the pouch.

2553
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,440
Who ain't finding a girlfriend?

2554
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,420
That's fucking right.

2555
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,340
No girlfriend for you.

2556
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,020
That's fucking right.

2557
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,440
Who ain't finding no girl?

2558
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,920
If I have anything to do with it.

2559
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,980
No girl.

2560
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:33,860
No girlfriend.

2561
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,160
Oh my God.

2562
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:36,780
I feel like we need this shot.

2563
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,360
Jesus Christ.

2564
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:41,140
No!

2565
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:43,220
No!

2566
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,920
That's so fucked up!

2567
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:50,190
That's right.

2568
01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:51,750
Deflate the sacks.

2569
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:53,770
Deflate the sacks!

2570
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,510
Doki the veterinarian is back!

2571
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:58,810
There is a bird problem!

2572
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:01,330
There you go.

2573
01:38:04,670 --> 01:38:05,410
There you go.

2574
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:06,830
You don't deserve to be in the sky.

2575
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,210
Only one person can deserve...

2576
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:11,070
deserves to be in the sky and that's me.

2577
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:13,570
Alright, I deflated it.

2578
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,290
No sky for you.

2579
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:17,810
No sky for you.

2580
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:18,690
No girlfriend for you, man.

2581
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:20,770
Oh, I think I have to jump.

2582
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:22,390
I have to jump on that, don't I?

2583
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:23,390
Arlo, please.

2584
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:24,830
Please be faster, Arlo.

2585
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:25,630
Please.

2586
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,210
No!

2587
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:29,870
I know!

2588
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:33,070
Bro, this fucking boss sucks.

2589
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:33,650
I know!

2590
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:39,530
Bro, this fucking boss fight fucking sucks.

2591
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:43,210
Bro, this fucking boss fight fucking sucks.

2592
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:43,550
Bro, this fucking boss fight fucking sucks.

2593
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,090
This has to be the worst boss.

2594
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:48,650
This 100% has to be the worst boss.

2595
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:49,010
This 100% has to be the worst boss.

2596
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:50,230
Because I don't know how to do this.

2597
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:52,950
Bro, please, Arlo.

2598
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:53,630
Please!

2599
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:56,630
You can fucking ride faster than this, Arlo.

2600
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:58,890
Please...

2601
01:38:59,530 --> 01:38:59,790
Oh!

2602
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:15,550
Is that a skill issue?

2603
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:15,990
Is that a skill issue?

2604
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,490
I don't know what you mean.

2605
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:20,270
Yes!

2606
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,290
Yes!

2607
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:24,010
Oh!

2608
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:24,690
Yes!

2609
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,410
I did it!

2610
01:39:25,570 --> 01:39:26,730
I DID IT!

2611
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:28,690
Skillet shoot my ass!

2612
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:29,970
There we go.

2613
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:32,110
It was just- it's Arlo's!

2614
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:33,670
It's Arlo's fault!

2615
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:35,730
There's no way!

2616
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,130
Never blame yourself when you're gaming.

2617
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:44,110
No, no, no, no, please, please!

2618
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:46,270
Here we go.

2619
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:47,970
Okay.

2620
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:49,670
I need my sword.

2621
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:50,770
Where is the thing?

2622
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:52,290
Oh, fuck!

2623
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:52,610
Okay!

2624
01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:55,550
I'm gonna go get my sword.

2625
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:57,250
There's no way he's gonna do a backflip.

2626
01:39:57,290 --> 01:39:57,970
Oh, there it is!

2627
01:39:58,150 --> 01:39:59,230
It's hidden back here!

2628
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:02,470
Alright, it's back to my regular job of being an acupuncturist.

2629
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:04,170
Finally!

2630
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:06,030
Oh my god!

2631
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:08,650
Bro, the economy was not nice to me, man.

2632
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:12,030
I had to take to get so many other different jobs.

2633
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:12,450
I had to take to get so many other different jobs.

2634
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:14,370
But this is what I'm passionate about!

2635
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:17,170
Stabbing people's back until they like it.

2636
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:17,610
Stabbing people's back until they like it.

2637
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,310
Okay, where's the other flap, though?

2638
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:19,930
Oh, no.

2639
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:22,090
Where could the other flap be?

2640
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:22,790
Behind?

2641
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:23,990
It has to be on the tail, right?

2642
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,350
Oh, god.

2643
01:40:25,550 --> 01:40:25,970
It's flat.

2644
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,230
What?

2645
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:26,510
Okay.

2646
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,650
We're okay.

2647
01:40:27,790 --> 01:40:29,170
I just gotta walk up.

2648
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:30,470
We're okay.

2649
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:31,530
He's not gonna do the flip!

2650
01:40:31,670 --> 01:40:32,590
Oh, he's not.

2651
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:33,650
He didn't do the flip, guys.

2652
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:35,190
He didn't do the flip.

2653
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:37,050
It has to be back here, right?

2654
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:37,430
Oh, yes.

2655
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:38,230
I knew it.

2656
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:39,230
I knew it.

2657
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:41,770
Oh my god.

2658
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,290
Thank god.

2659
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:44,410
Where is your license?

2660
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:45,390
What?

2661
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:47,690
Oh, he like closed it!

2662
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:50,450
Wait, do I have to deflate his sacs again?

2663
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:51,910
Open up!

2664
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:54,550
Oh, wait.

2665
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:55,510
Did I hit it?

2666
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:55,870
Did I hit everything?

2667
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:57,690
Guys,

2668
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,960
do you think he liked it?

2669
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,700
Look, after every acupuncture...

2670
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:16,860
After every acupuncture session, he has to take a mud bath.

2671
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,680
So, like, the mud will fill up the holes and patch it up, you know?

2672
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,660
So, you know how, like, I poked holes into his body?

2673
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:29,400
So, now, he has to go take a mud bath to cleanse his skin of all the...

2674
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,800
of all the excess toxins.

2675
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,140
And then the mud will fill up the holes and...

2676
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,240
Where did he go?

2677
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,980
And the mud will fill up his holes.

2678
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:43,620
And so, like, it will, like, block out all the bacteria outside.

2679
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:45,000
Don't worry.

2680
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,020
I'm a specialist.

2681
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,080
Oh my god, he reclued his sacs.

2682
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,200
Bro.

2683
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,080
How many times do I have to teach you, old man?

2684
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,560
Can't have a girlfriend.

2685
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:58,700
Okay!

2686
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:04,290
Oh, am I okay?

2687
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:04,410
I can't

2688
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:09,880
think I was okay.

2689
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,640
I don't know.

2690
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:14,680
Guys.

2691
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,460
I'm okay, guys.

2692
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,040
Don't worry.

2693
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,220
We're fine.

2694
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:23,900
Did they grow bigger?

2695
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,120
It's like a pimple.

2696
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,960
You pop the pimple and it comes back bigger.

2697
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:31,780
The horse rotate.

2698
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,520
Oh my god.

2699
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:35,520
Bro, you're not having a girlfriend!

2700
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,200
You can't afford a girlfriend right now!

2701
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:43,080
You gotta work on yourself before you can work on having a girlfriend!

2702
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,560
Oh my god.

2703
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:46,680
It's time to deflate.

2704
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,120
No more girlfriend for you.

2705
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,700
It's time to deflate the sacs.

2706
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:55,980
Please.

2707
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,920
How am I not hitting?

2708
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,300
That's so real.

2709
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:01,940
Alright.

2710
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:02,960
I know.

2711
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,360
We need to get there closer.

2712
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,360
Don't keep...

2713
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:07,980
Don't keep...

2714
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,200
Look.

2715
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,000
I'm here to give you a life lesson, man.

2716
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:15,040
Look at you.

2717
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,100
Where do you...

2718
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,000
You live in the fucking desert?

2719
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:21,260
Bro.

2720
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:25,840
Do you really think this is the way to go?

2721
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:27,020
Sir?

2722
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:30,200
You live in the goddamn desert?

2723
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:32,860
Okay.

2724
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,080
That has to be like close enough, right?

2725
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:36,120
There you go.

2726
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:37,440
I deflated one of the sacs.

2727
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:38,020
I'm gonna go back.

2728
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:38,460
Alright.

2729
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,020
We gotta get closer to the other one.

2730
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:40,900
Sac number two.

2731
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:42,060
Oh wait.

2732
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,100
Sac behind me.

2733
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:44,980
I almost forgot this one.

2734
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,400
Eventually I'll hit it.

2735
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,420
Eventually.

2736
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,020
Yeah!

2737
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:52,800
Do it!

2738
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:54,200
You don't...

2739
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,000
You miss...

2740
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,200
You hit the shots you take eventually.

2741
01:43:59,820 --> 01:44:01,080
You just gotta keep shooting.

2742
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:04,960
Oh no.

2743
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,480
Is he going back to take his mud bath?

2744
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,800
Are the sacs gonna be deflated again?

2745
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,500
Is it filled with sand?

2746
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:13,720
Oh no.

2747
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,100
Where is he going?

2748
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,200
Oh no.

2749
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,060
Not again.

2750
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,260
Not again.

2751
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:22,260
Not again.

2752
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,460
Guys, I don't wanna do the flip again.

2753
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,760
Can I climb up from here?

2754
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:30,120
Okay.

2755
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:30,680
Don't worry.

2756
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:31,760
I'll grab this one.

2757
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,700
Eventually I can hit.

2758
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,320
Arlo, please.

2759
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:35,980
Arlo, please.

2760
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:40,740
Arlo!

2761
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:40,740
Okay.

2762
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:41,800
Nice.

2763
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:42,940
That must be a hit.

2764
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:43,380
There we go.

2765
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:43,720
We got it.

2766
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,600
We got it.

2767
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:46,360
We got it, Ma.

2768
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,280
No more girlfriend.

2769
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:50,380
Alright.

2770
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:50,860
Here we go.

2771
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:51,380
This is it.

2772
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,640
Practice this.

2773
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:53,860
This is it.

2774
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,260
Right here.

2775
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,620
Right now, Arlo.

2776
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:56,900
Right here.

2777
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:58,460
Right now, Arlo.

2778
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,040
God damn it, Arlo!

2779
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:04,270
I said right here, right now!

2780
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:06,570
Arlo!

2781
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:08,210
Right here, right now!

2782
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:11,110
Yeah!

2783
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:11,610
Okay.

2784
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:12,210
This time.

2785
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:13,490
Alright.

2786
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:14,650
Where the fuck is he?

2787
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:16,950
We can't do this.

2788
01:45:17,610 --> 01:45:18,470
Right here.

2789
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:18,830
Right now.

2790
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:20,030
It's not my fault, guys!

2791
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:22,930
Arlo just doesn't take directions quite well yet!

2792
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:25,410
It's like our first time!

2793
01:45:26,490 --> 01:45:27,250
Arlo, please.

2794
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:28,910
Don't blame the horse.

2795
01:45:28,970 --> 01:45:30,390
Blame the rider.

2796
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:32,790
How about it's both our faults, okay?

2797
01:45:33,010 --> 01:45:33,930
How about that?

2798
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:37,810
Is that better?

2799
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:40,950
It's both our faults, okay guys?

2800
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:42,290
Okay, we're done.

2801
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:43,490
We both take blame!

2802
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:45,570
It's me and Arlo's fault!

2803
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:46,950
Oh, God.

2804
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:48,290
Climb up.

2805
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,310
Climb up.

2806
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:50,750
Climb up.

2807
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:51,110
Yay!

2808
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:53,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2809
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:55,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2810
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:56,650
Come on, come on!

2811
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,770
Go to the other side!

2812
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:58,230
Come on!

2813
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,070
Come on!

2814
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:02,010
Yes!

2815
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:04,410
Okay, where is the other one?

2816
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:05,690
Is it like back here?

2817
01:46:06,570 --> 01:46:08,890
I don't remember which one I fucking hit.

2818
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:11,210
There's like so many fins.

2819
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,370
Okay.

2820
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,030
Oh, it's behind.

2821
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:14,830
It's in the back.

2822
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,350
Alright, it is in the back.

2823
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:18,670
Oh, there it is!

2824
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:19,670
There it is!

2825
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:20,530
Here we go!

2826
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:22,750
And...

2827
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:23,070
Ha!

2828
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:25,850
Alright, several more shots.

2829
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:27,710
Don't worry, it's my passion!

2830
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:31,270
It has to be like one more.

2831
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:35,550
What the fuck?

2832
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:35,710
Oh!

2833
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:36,970
Oh, I already finished all of them.

2834
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:37,190
Oh!

2835
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:39,050
Please grab onto it.

2836
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:39,970
Please grab onto it.

2837
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:42,170
I don't know which one I haven't done yet, sir!

2838
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:44,950
You have so many sore spots!

2839
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:47,750
It has to be the back, right?

2840
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:49,350
Oh my god, where am I?

2841
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:50,110
Oh my god, it's his butt.

2842
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:51,550
Oh my god, god.

2843
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:53,010
Sir, you need to stop.

2844
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:54,070
Buy a better chair.

2845
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:55,110
Sir.

2846
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:55,950
Oh!

2847
01:46:56,210 --> 01:46:56,910
Oh my god.

2848
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:57,910
That scared me.

2849
01:46:58,330 --> 01:46:59,230
Sir, please.

2850
01:46:59,530 --> 01:47:01,530
Sir, you can't keep sitting on those chairs.

2851
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:01,790
No!

2852
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:05,950
Sir, I'm trying to help you!

2853
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,950
You can't keep sitting on those chairs!

2854
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:08,890
You're sitting on these cheap plastic chairs forever!

2855
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:10,930
Please!

2856
01:47:11,150 --> 01:47:12,010
Open up!

2857
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,570
No!

2858
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,050
Alright, guys.

2859
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,630
Guys, I don't think he wants...

2860
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:20,810
Guys, he's just taking another mud bath.

2861
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:22,730
Oh my god.

2862
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,070
Not a round three.

2863
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:27,970
Not a fucking round three.

2864
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:30,470
This is dirt bath time.

2865
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:32,130
He's like a fucking chinchilla.

2866
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:34,410
Alright, here we go.

2867
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:36,710
Here we go.

2868
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:37,610
Here we go again.

2869
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:39,810
You can and will.

2870
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,250
Sir!

2871
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:42,150
You have to keep...

2872
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:45,070
You have to fucking let me massage the ass!

2873
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:48,710
God, poke the ass and let out the stress!

2874
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:53,810
You have to get better chairs!

2875
01:47:54,070 --> 01:47:56,670
You gotta stop fucking buying those cheap plastic chairs!

2876
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:57,690
Those long chairs!

2877
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,510
They're not good for your butt.

2878
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:01,090
At least put a cushion on it!

2879
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,970
One more time.

2880
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:06,250
One more time.

2881
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:08,870
Alright.

2882
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:10,850
I swear to god if I have...

2883
01:48:10,850 --> 01:48:11,990
Sir, please.

2884
01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:13,630
I told you.

2885
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:16,150
Now is not the right time to have a girlfriend.

2886
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:17,930
Stop doing...

2887
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:18,890
Nobody's watching.

2888
01:48:19,090 --> 01:48:20,430
No female...

2889
01:48:22,270 --> 01:48:25,650
No female is watching your dance right now, sir!

2890
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:31,370
You gotta work on yourself first before you do all of this!

2891
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:35,270
Please!

2892
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,890
You literally live in the goddamn desert!

2893
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,230
Look, I am a professional.

2894
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:50,010
It's acupuncture is first before female.

2895
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,230
I am...

2896
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:54,250
very passionate about my job.

2897
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:56,270
Oh my god.

2898
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:58,610
Do not look at the way I aim right now.

2899
01:48:58,930 --> 01:48:59,070
Do not look at the way I aim right now.

2900
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:02,110
There you go.

2901
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:03,430
There you go.

2902
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:04,770
There you go.

2903
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:05,990
Alright.

2904
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:06,730
Oh my god.

2905
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,830
This has to be my toughest client yet.

2906
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:10,290
Bro.

2907
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:12,550
You're getting charged extra, man.

2908
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:16,970
I'm gonna put all those hidden fees like a hotel.

2909
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:21,200
Alright.

2910
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:27,400
I'm gonna put all those hidden fees in that fucking bill soon.

2911
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,860
Okay, we gotta...

2912
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,740
We gotta climb up again.

2913
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,220
I'm doki, bro.

2914
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,380
Look, it's not my fault he's a tough client.

2915
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:41,780
Alright?

2916
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:45,880
He's just a really tough client right now.

2917
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,120
Are you fucking...

2918
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:47,540
No.

2919
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,360
Please!

2920
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:50,640
God damn it.

2921
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,660
This is the worst.

2922
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,860
This is the worst.

2923
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,920
He's gonna use young girls to choose to live in the desert.

2924
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:01,280
He just can't.

2925
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,700
Bro, the red is just insane.

2926
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:02,720
He's just gonna use young girls to choose to live in the desert.

2927
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,880
It's like almost like New York City.

2928
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:07,100
It's like almost like New York City.

2929
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,720
Oh my god.

2930
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:09,200
Please.

2931
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:14,020
The hardest part is just jumping onto these fucking things.

2932
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,840
The hardest part is just jumping onto these fucking things.

2933
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,520
Are you fucking kidding me?

2934
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:27,950
Oh my god.

2935
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:29,930
What are you...

2936
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:33,920
I hate this.

2937
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:34,760
I hate this one.

2938
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:36,280
There's gonna be so many hidden fees.

2939
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:39,180
I'm gonna try to like triple the price and then I'm gonna ask for a discount.

2940
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:42,100
I'm gonna try to like triple the price and then I'm gonna ask for a discount.

2941
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,780
Come on, come on, come on.

2942
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:47,040
Please, Arlo.

2943
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:47,360
No!

2944
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,300
I can't.

2945
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:52,360
I can't.

2946
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:52,980
I can't.

2947
01:50:58,970 --> 01:51:01,050
Why is he so fucking...

2948
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:01,310
Why

2949
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:07,570
is he so fucking...

2950
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:09,550
Why is he so fucking...

2951
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:11,330
Guys.

2952
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,250
Guys.

2953
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:13,050
Guys.

2954
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:13,370
Guys.

2955
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:17,850
For all you bot watchers, you might have to skip this.

2956
01:51:17,890 --> 01:51:19,110
I'm gonna wait like five minutes into the stream.

2957
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:25,010
For all the bot watchers.

2958
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:29,630
Just wait like five more minutes and then we'll get there.

2959
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:30,150
I swear.

2960
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:33,290
Just wait five more minutes.

2961
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:35,350
Okay.

2962
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:36,850
What?

2963
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:39,550
Fucking

2964
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:48,250
air pouches again.

2965
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,690
I have a feeling.

2966
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:52,510
Oh.

2967
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:54,550
There's no way.

2968
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:55,310
There's no way.

2969
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:56,990
I fucking gripped it.

2970
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:58,230
Keep

2971
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:36,860
going.

2972
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:37,260
Keep going.

2973
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,300
We have to keep going.

2974
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:41,740
We fucking delayed so much that we gotta head to the ass.

2975
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:42,760
Please.

2976
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:44,260
Head to the butt.

2977
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,240
Get to the butt.

2978
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,800
It's the only way.

2979
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:51,440
It's so far from the ass.

2980
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,500
Oh my god.

2981
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,160
It's so fucking far.

2982
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,780
Why are you so long?

2983
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:01,840
Why are you so long?

2984
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:03,880
Okay.

2985
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,260
It's way too long, man.

2986
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,420
Alright, here we go.

2987
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,760
God, it's just all body.

2988
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:10,800
No ass.

2989
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:11,780
Please.

2990
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:15,180
Worst appointment ever.

2991
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,060
Worst appointment ever.

2992
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:16,980
Don't call me back.

2993
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,320
We will never fix your stress again.

2994
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,260
We will never fix your stress again.

2995
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,840
A lot of collapse.

2996
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:29,540
This is the worst one.

2997
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,880
I'm gonna fucking charge so many hidden fees.

2998
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:36,020
Worst customer.

2999
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,340
I'm banning him.

3000
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,860
I'm gonna take a picture and then put him on the banned list.

3001
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:49,420
You know those convenience stores where they're like never servicing that person again?

3002
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:50,180
That's him.

3003
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:51,140
Bro.

3004
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,640
You're the worst client I've ever had.

3005
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:55,340
Everybody else was so nice.

3006
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,420
This was my passion too.

3007
01:53:57,820 --> 01:53:58,820
I can't believe I'm not getting paid for this.

3008
01:53:58,840 --> 01:53:59,180
I can't believe it.

3009
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,380
You ruined my passion.

3010
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:03,040
Wes, thank you for the super chat.

3011
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:03,540
Thank you.

3012
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:04,120
Thank you.

3013
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,080
So that was your favorite one, right?

3014
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,220
Ban forever.

3015
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,400
Don't call back.

3016
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,000
Thank you for the super chat.

3017
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:11,380
Thank you.

3018
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:11,940
Thank you.

3019
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:15,680
Ban from life.

3020
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:20,920
Alright, nice.

3021
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:24,880
It's so nice that they always transport me back to my home.

3022
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:26,840
Look at that.

3023
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,500
See?

3024
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,860
They love this.

3025
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:30,220
They love my work so much.

3026
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:31,540
Please take me back home.

3027
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,600
Isn't that great?

3028
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:50,760
Oh my god.

3029
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,780
Please tell me I don't have to drive the horse anymore.

3030
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:54,180
Please.

3031
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:56,820
Please.

3032
01:54:56,940 --> 01:55:00,220
Please tell me that was the last time I have to drive the horse.

3033
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,900
Please for the love of god.

3034
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,540
A guardian set loose.

3035
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:14,280
A closed off city beyond the channel.

3036
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:16,320
Where's that?

3037
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,420
Is that not desert?

3038
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,560
Lust for destruction.

3039
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:20,940
Okay, it's not the desert.

3040
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:22,920
That's a win in my book.

3041
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,860
No desert.

3042
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:25,760
No desert.

3043
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,260
No desert win.

3044
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:30,380
Win time.

3045
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:37,540
Yeah!

3046
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,560
No desert!

3047
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:39,460
Let's go!

3048
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:43,100
No more deserts!

3049
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:44,980
Let's fucking go!

3050
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:48,980
As long as there's no more deserts.

3051
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:52,720
That's all that matters.

3052
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:57,980
Senpai, thank you for the super chat.

3053
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:58,300
Thank you.

3054
01:55:58,980 --> 01:55:59,820
Pray to save.

3055
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,220
Pray to save?

3056
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:02,960
Let me pray.

3057
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,000
There you go.

3058
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:05,940
A doki shoutout from Brazil!

3059
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,880
My belly hurts from laughing at that sassy tomato girl.

3060
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,440
Tell me any plans on playing Splatoon.

3061
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:12,380
Thank you for the super chat.

3062
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:12,680
Thank you.

3063
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:13,380
Thank you.

3064
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,840
Definitely in the future.

3065
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,960
I know there's Splatfest tomorrow.

3066
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:22,660
Because two of my friends, they're like S++ rank.

3067
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,000
Like the highest rank possible.

3068
01:56:24,140 --> 01:56:24,720
Is it X rank?

3069
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:26,780
Oh wait, it's X rank, right?

3070
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,860
The highest rank possible.

3071
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,680
And they invited me to do some Splatfest.

3072
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:33,260
But I was like, guys, I haven't played Splatoon in a long time.

3073
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:34,620
So we're gonna do it off stream.

3074
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:37,120
Because they're like hardcore Splatoon players.

3075
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,400
You guys might know them.

3076
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:40,860
Poki and GG.

3077
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,660
And you might know who they are.

3078
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:43,680
I know who the two artists are.

3079
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,880
Because they're like really...

3080
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:50,060

They invited me to play some Splatoon off stream.

3091
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:14,020
They were deciding whether to do it off stream or on stream.

3092
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:15,320
And...

3093
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:16,840

Because I was so bad at...

3170
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,200
Multitasking.

3171
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,000
Um...

3172
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,020

3173
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:00,740
Like...

3174
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:02,420
For a very long time.

3175
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,780
Like when I was just a really small streamer.

3176
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:06,680
Because like...

3177
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,180
Where the fuck do I go?

3178
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:10,320
Is it across the map again?

3179
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:11,060
It has to be.

3180
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:12,480
It's across the map.

3181
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:14,820
I've been friends with them like...

3182
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:16,380
For a long long...

3183
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:18,420
For a while now.

3184
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:19,560
Before...

3185
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,920
Before you know I started...

3186
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:24,800
Like actually Vtubing.

3187
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,140
Um...

3188
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:29,260
I think like we met when we were like art streamers.

3189
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:30,940
When we did like art and stuff.

3190
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,720
And like I noticed that like...

3191
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:35,140
They know Cantonese.

3192
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:35,960
And stuff.

3193
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:36,440
So I was like...

3194
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,060
Oh my god!

3195
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,300
You know Cantonese?

3196
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:39,660
I know Cantonese!

3197
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,860
And then we like...

3198
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:41,820
Responded over that.

3199
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:42,340
And we like...

3200
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:43,060
Rated each other.

3201
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:45,620
And we were like super small art streamers.

3202
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:46,980
And then you know...

3203
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:49,200
Like we've been friends because of that.

3204
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:49,980
Like we're like...

3205
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:51,560

3207
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:57,060
And then...

3208
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:00,220
That's how we like met.

3209
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:04,960
Yeah like when we were all like small...

3210
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,240
Art streamers and stuff.

3211
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:06,760
We like...

3212
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:07,500
Rated each other.

3213
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:10,800
I think it was like before Vtubers were a thing too.

3214
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:11,720
Like not Vtubers.

3215
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:12,280
Before like...

3216
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,120
Before like HoloEN ever like...

3217
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:16,040

3218
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:17,520
And like Vtubers were still like...

3219
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,200
A new concept.

3220
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:19,880
In the western side.

3221
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,620
Have I been to that shrine before?

3222
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:24,980
Can't tell.

3223
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:25,800

3224
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:28,280

3225
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:33,540

3226
02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:35,040

3227
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:38,280

3228
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:39,040

Same hat!

3231
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:45,960
Jesus Christ.

3232
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:49,160

This is like the closest.

3259
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:32,120
Everyone always makes fun of me.

3260
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:33,440
Because I can't roll my R's.

3261

Little pipa.

3267
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:51,900
That's like the closest I can to like rolling my R's.

3268
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:54,600

Still alive.

3276
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,020
Still.

3277
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:14,140
There you go.

3278
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,220
Not alive anymore.

3279
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,640
Okay this is like.

3280
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,720
I just want to test my theory out.

3281
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,580
About like if we can do an infinite food glitch with salamanders.

3282
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:27,720
It's like okay.

3283
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:28,800
Like I'm just saying.

3284
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,520
If they can like you know.

3285
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,200
It's like you can eat worms and stuff.

3286
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:33,620
Right?

3287
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:34,520

02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:46,080
That old book about eating worms and stuff.

3293
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:47,160

02:03:58,780 --> 02:03:59,620
We can fix.

3303
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:01,520

3304
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:03,640

3305
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,060
Cause we can have.

3306
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,480
Technically we can have infinite food.

3307
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,780
Food glitch with worms.

3308
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:11,760
If you think about it.

3309
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:15,140
And like it's all about how you season the worms.

3310
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:15,640
You know?

3311
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:18,720
Okay it's this way.

3312
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:19,800
I'm going to do the jump.

3313
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,280
Goodbye Ido.

3314
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:23,300
Wee!

3315
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:24,560
There's no way I die.

3316
02:04:24,780 --> 02:04:25,580
See I'm fine.

3317
02:04:25,880 --> 02:04:27,420
I eat so much fruit.

3318
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:28,840
That I'm fine.

3319
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:29,540
Like that.

3320
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:30,860
Speedrun.

3321
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:33,800
I'm just saying.

3322
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:36,640
Okay well no you just raise the children.

3323
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,680
Off of a worm only diet.

3324
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:41,680
So they never know what actually tastes good.

3325
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:42,500
Like.

3326
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:46,380
It's just all about like the seasoning.

3327
02:04:47,120 --> 02:04:48,080
If you have.

3328
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,560
Put good enough seasoning.

3329
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,600
It'll eventually taste good.

3330
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,120
And then all you have to do.

3331
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:53,940
Is just like.

3332
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:57,320
It's so funny.

3333
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:57,820
I'm so fucked up.

3334
02:04:58,260 --> 02:04:59,900
It's still food.

3335
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:03,920
The child has no concept of what is good food.

3336
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:07,040
You raise him like a bird.

3337
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:07,820
You mean.

3338
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:09,580
It's still food.

3339
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:10,700
I don't.

3340
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,880
That's so cruel.

3341
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:19,560
Okay look.

3342
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,780
Salamander tails and worms.

3343
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:23,020
Is that better?

3344
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:26,700
Salamander tails and worms.

3345
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:28,320
They're a healthy diet.

3346
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,340
That's enough meat.

3347
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:29,440
I'm going to eat this.

3348
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:29,740
Right?

3349
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:32,560
Thank you for the super chat.

3350
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:33,180
Thank you.

3351
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,160
That's enough meat.

3352
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:38,620
Where the fuck do I go?

3353
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,780
No that's not it.

3354
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:43,660
Most normal.

3355
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:45,000
Dirty tangent.

3356
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,780
Mike thank you for the super chat.

3357
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:47,220
Thank you.

3358
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:49,160
That's not it.

3359
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:52,380
I'm just trying to figure out how to like.

3360
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:54,200
Do the infinite food glitch.

3361
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:56,100
Are you not curious out of science?

3362
02:05:57,780 --> 02:05:58,540
For science.

3363
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,220
You do not care about science.

3364
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,220
Scientific reasoning.

3365
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,880
Why don't we just farm real animals?

3366
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:07,960
Because you can't do it.

3367
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:09,700
Because when you farm real animals.

3368
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:11,840
Okay are you trying to say worms are not real?

3369
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,600
Worms deserve like.

3370
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:14,680
Rights too.

3371
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,600
Like okay the thing about farming real animals.

3372
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,300
Is that you have to.

3373
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:25,940
Where the fuck do I get across?

3374
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,440
The thing about farming real animals.

3375
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:30,660
Is that eventually.

3376
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:32,420
Like it takes too long.

3377
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,600
To farm them.

3378
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:35,460
That's the whole issue.

3379
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:38,700
Real animals just take too long to farm.

3380
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,460
But like.

3381
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:42,940
But like if you like cut a worm.

3382
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:44,880
And like or like you know grab it.

3383
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:45,620
And sell it man.

3384
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:48,160
They eventually regrow it in there.

3385
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,460
Like multiple times.

3386
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:51,780
So like all I'm saying.

3387
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:52,840
Is like starfish.

3388
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,620
We can eat starfish too.

3389
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:56,280
Because they can regrow their limbs.

3390
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,900
Think about it.

3391
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:00,840
We just eat the animals that can regrow themselves.

3392
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:06,720
Guys think about it.

3393
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,900
And then we don't have to worry about like.

3394
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:12,920
We don't have to build more farms.

3395
02:07:13,240 --> 02:07:13,680
To like.

3396
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,380
Guys think about it.

3397
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:16,720
We don't have to build more farms.

3398
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,880
To fix like the.

3399
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:21,000
Like you know.

3400
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,740
We don't have to demolish more forests.

3401
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:25,480
To build more farms.

3402
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:26,860
To build more like.

3403
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:30,020
Okay so what about the vegans and the vegetarians.

3404
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:30,800
Well.

3405
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:36,860
What about.

3406
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:40,660
I guess we'll grow fruit.

3407
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:41,340
I don't know.

3408
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:44,680
I'm thinking about like.

3409
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:45,520
The meat lover.

3410
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:47,480
The meat lover problems right now.

3411
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:50,320
We'll tackle vegans and vegetarians.

3412
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:51,500
Another time.

3413
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:53,280
This is about like.

3414
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:57,040
We're tackling problems one at a time.

3415
02:07:57,080 --> 02:07:57,500
Guys.

3416
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,840
There's too many problems in the world.

3417
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:00,680
Okay.

3418
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:02,400
Thank you.

3419
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:06,280
That's what.

3420
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:08,560
That's why we're talking about.

3421
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,440
The stomach scenario.

3422
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,000
Okay.

3423
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:13,600
Where do I go?

3424
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:14,260
Do I go straight?

3425
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:16,500
Am I going the right way?

3426
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:19,500
Am I going the right way?

3427
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:19,980
Is it up?

3428
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:21,460
It has to be up right?

3429
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:24,280
I feel like I'm not going the right way.

3430
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,860
Is this the right way?

3431
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:33,060
Up I believe.

3432
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:34,820
I don't know.

3433
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:36,180
I don't even know guys.

3434
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:40,700
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

3435
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:42,920
To the left?

3436
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:43,700
Have I been here?

3437
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:45,060
Yeah I have.

3438
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:45,920
Is it left side?

3439
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:49,660
This floor.

3440
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,740
I need to figure out where to go.

3441
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,460
It's like here.

3442
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:57,280
I guess like this way?

3443
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:00,360
It's close to the.

3444
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:01,200
Which fish?

3445
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:05,820
I've like fucking killed so many like aquatic creatures.

3446
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:07,580
Is it this way?

3447
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,500
Am I going the right way guys?

3448
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:11,540
I can't tell.

3449
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:13,800
It has to be the right way.

3450
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:14,960
Eight hours.

3451
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:15,040
I'm going the right way.

3452
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:16,060
Eight hours later.

3453
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,820
This has to be the right way.

3454
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,240
Right?

3455
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:20,500
Yeah.

3456
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:23,200
Yeah yeah yeah.

3457
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,980
I think I'm so smart.

3458
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:25,640
I think I'm right.

3459
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:29,500
I think I solved world hunger.

3460
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:32,660
Guys.

3461
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,380
I think I solved world hunger.

3462
02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:39,320
If people aren't like pussies about eating worms and salamanders.

3463
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,900
We'll be fine.

3464
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:45,040
Like eat worms or 600k Scoville chicken with fish.

3465
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:45,900
No milk.

3466
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,340
Oh 100% the 600k Scoville chicken.

3467
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:51,740
Cause that shit is like not that spicy to me.

3468
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:51,980
Yeah.

3469
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:59,400
All I'm saying is that people are cowards.

3470
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:02,980
People are fucking cowards.

3471
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:03,540
There's just not.

3472
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:06,280
Who cares about what a food tastes like.

3473
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,920
It's all about getting your proteins.

3474
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:08,680
Right?

3475
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:14,480
As long as we get our proteins in.

3476
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,040
We're fucking rich.

3477
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:15,360
We're fucking fine.

3478
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:19,340
Why do you guys care about what a food tastes like?

3479
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:24,560
Butoki why don't you try it out then?

3480
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,760
Look okay.

3481
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:30,080
I can't like lead by example if no one else wants to like lead with me.

3482
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:31,720
Okay this is a group effort.

3483
02:10:31,980 --> 02:10:33,360
I can't do this on my own.

3484
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:35,220
Guys.

3485
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:40,260
I can't do this on my own.

3486
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,040
It's all about working together.

3487
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:46,880
You first.

3488
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,140
Look.

3489
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,220
We're here to work together.

3490
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:53,360
It's not a race here.

3491
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:54,980
It's about teamwork.

3492
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:58,480
It's our ideas.

3493
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,280
We cooked this idea together.

3494
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,960
It's not your idea.

3495
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,180
It's our ideas.

3496
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:07,300
Together.

3497
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:08,760
Cause we're a team.

3498
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:09,440
Dragons.

3499
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:10,340
You and I.

3500
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:11,120
We're a team.

3501
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,080
What happened to being a team?

3502
02:11:13,080 --> 02:11:13,180
We're a team.

3503
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:20,180
Guys we came up with this idea together.

3504
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:22,340
You do not want to solve world hunger?

3505
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:23,500
That's fucked up chat.

3506
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:30,360
Yes Doki.

3507
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:31,800
Manipulation.

3508
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,920
That's so healthy.

3509
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,240
Manipulation and gaslighting.

3510
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:42,000
That's so healthy.

3511
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:43,240
We did it.

3512
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:53,080
Alright here we go.

3513
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:58,400
This is it.

3514
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:59,080
Where is he?

3515
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:01,020
Where the fuck is the guy?

3516
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:06,260
Where is he?

3517
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:10,580
Where do I go?

3518
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:15,820
Where the fuck is the colossi?

3519
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,180
Oh it's here.

3520
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:18,680
There's like a little hole here.

3521
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:21,020
Down the hole we go.

3522
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:24,100
A red flower.

3523
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:25,720
What the fuck am I gonna do with a red flower?

3524
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:28,640
Where is this guy anyway?

3525
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:34,880
Oh there he is.

3526
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:37,420
Oh my god he's like a guard dog.

3527
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,380
I've killed his brother.

3528
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:40,460
I mean I've...

3529
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,700
I gave his brother a belly rub.

3530
02:12:50,370 --> 02:12:50,890
Hello.

3531
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:51,630
What do I do?

3532
02:12:52,370 --> 02:12:54,330
Is he gonna like knock me over again?

3533
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:56,510
What the fuck do I do?

3534
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:58,230
Sir.

3535
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:00,990
Sir what is your problem?

3536
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:02,730
What problems do you have sir?

3537
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:04,290
Oh my god he can jump.

3538
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:06,470
What the fuck do I do?

3539
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:07,470
What's that?

3540
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:12,170
Hello?

3541
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:14,790
Hello?

3542
02:13:16,910 --> 02:13:17,370
Phew.

3543
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:18,430
I'm right here sir.

3544
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:20,570
What the fuck do I do?

3545
02:13:20,670 --> 02:13:21,450
He has no heart.

3546
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:24,050
Can I climb this?

3547
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,490
Oh no.

3548
02:13:26,610 --> 02:13:27,850
I don't know what to do.

3549
02:13:28,210 --> 02:13:29,030
Oh no.

3550
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:32,190
Oh no.

3551
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,430
Oh no.

3552
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:33,990
What the fuck do I do?

3553
02:13:34,970 --> 02:13:35,930
Oh shit.

3554
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:37,330
Oh what the fuck?

3555
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:38,030
Oh wait I'm okay.

3556
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:39,390
Wait that didn't hurt.

3557
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:40,590
Wait I'm okay.

3558
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:41,590
Oh please.

3559
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:43,130
Okay never mind that hurt.

3560
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:46,210
Alright guys.

3561
02:13:46,610 --> 02:13:47,710
I fouled up.

3562
02:13:47,790 --> 02:13:48,630
Please get up.

3563
02:13:48,710 --> 02:13:50,150
It's just a little concussion.

3564
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:50,630
Get up.

3565
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:51,430
Oh he did it.

3566
02:13:51,450 --> 02:13:52,650
Oh thank god.

3567
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:53,030
Okay.

3568
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:54,610
Parkour.

3569
02:13:55,390 --> 02:13:56,110
Climb something?

3570
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:56,710
This?

3571
02:13:57,930 --> 02:13:59,130
Oh do I climb this?

3572
02:13:59,330 --> 02:14:00,450
And then I jump over there?

3573
02:14:01,010 --> 02:14:01,670
I think so.

3574
02:14:01,870 --> 02:14:02,190
Right?

3575
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:03,670
Wait let's go down climb.

3576
02:14:04,070 --> 02:14:04,770
Thank god.

3577
02:14:04,790 --> 02:14:05,050
Okay.

3578
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:06,070
Parkour.

3579
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:09,750
Parkour.

3580
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:12,250
Okay it's parkour time.

3581
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:15,070
Watch this.

3582
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:15,770
Up foot.

3583
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:17,150
Weee.

3584
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:19,770
Okay and then I climb up.

3585
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:20,610
Now what do I do?

3586
02:14:21,790 --> 02:14:22,910
I'm king of the world.

3587
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:29,080
Heard a reboot in king of the hill.

3588
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:30,480
Alright what are we gonna do?

3589
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:32,200
I have the high ground now.

3590
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,400
The fuck are you gonna do about it huh?

3591
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:36,260
That's fucking right.

3592
02:14:36,380 --> 02:14:36,780
Nothing.

3593
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:38,160
Cause I'm taller than you.

3594
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,380
If you're taller, you're smarter.

3595
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:44,560
Hello?

3596
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:45,600
What are you doing?

3597
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:47,440
What the fuck do I do up here?

3598
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:48,720
I thought I fell.

3599
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:51,600
I shot the ass.

3600
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,000
We actually made it.

3601
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:08,260
Where's the other platform?

3602
02:15:08,620 --> 02:15:09,580
Oh my god.

3603
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:10,720
Did you guys see that?

3604
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,520
I actually made the jump.

3605
02:15:12,940 --> 02:15:14,400
The cutscene jump.

3606
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:15,140
What the fuck.

3607
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:18,620
Gaming.

3608
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:22,280
That's when you know I'm a gamer.

3609
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:29,800
Get yourself a doki that can fucking do the cutscene jump.

3610
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,180
Did you see it?

3611
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:32,320
Circle emoji.

3612
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:33,180
Did you see it?

3613
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:34,960
Is that it?

3614
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,120
Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah woah.

3615
02:15:37,220 --> 02:15:38,620
Do I have to do another jump here?

3616
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:40,460
Later?

3617
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:41,860
Do I have to do a cutscene jump?

3618
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:42,940
Alright come on.

3619
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:43,880
Come on.

3620
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:45,600
Do it again.

3621
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:47,780
Now I'm a...

3622
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:49,920
Now I'm a professional parkour artist.

3623
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:51,580
I have many jobs.

3624
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:52,940
I'm shooting the butt again.

3625
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,340
That's right.

3626
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:54,660
What are you gonna do about it huh?

3627
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:56,380
That's fucking right.

3628
02:15:58,160 --> 02:15:58,720
Come on.

3629
02:15:58,960 --> 02:15:59,540
Charge me.

3630
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:03,820
Get in my face.

3631
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,660
Oh shit.

3632
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:05,600
Oh shit.

3633
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:07,000
Weeee.

3634
02:16:08,180 --> 02:16:10,180
I actually thought I was gonna miss.

3635
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:13,900
Alright here we go again.

3636
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,100
Come on.

3637
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:16,100
Do it again.

3638
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:16,980
It'll be so funny.

3639
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:21,040
Come on.

3640
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,200
It'll be so fucking funny.

3641
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:25,980
I'm so old.

3642
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,620
You guys.

3643
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:33,880
Guys, I don't think he thought it was funny.

3644
02:16:36,860 --> 02:16:39,420
I don't think he thought it was funny, guys.

3645
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:43,380
I don't know why, but I think he thought it was funny.

3646
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:47,840
Last minute save.

3647
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:49,840
I told you I'm a professional parkour artist.

3648
02:16:58,800 --> 02:16:59,680
Another one.

3649
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:02,560
Another one.

3650
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:03,920
Where do I jump from here?

3651
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,560
Like there?

3652
02:17:04,820 --> 02:17:06,260
I guess there, right?

3653
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:07,900
There's no more areas to jump to.

3654
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:12,300
Again, again!

3655
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:14,660
Again, come on bro!

3656
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:16,340
Why are you so fucking pussy?

3657
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:18,860
Your

3658
02:17:23,110 --> 02:17:24,030
wife left you!

3659
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:33,260
Okay, nice.

3660
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:34,380
And then we jump from here.

3661
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,520
Alright.

3662
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:39,980
Up we go.

3663
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:41,080
Up we go.

3664
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,540
Come on sir!

3665
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:45,380
What do you do again?

3666
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:48,300
We gotta fix your concussion too.

3667
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:50,860
We all know to fix your concussion you just gotta keep...

3668
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:51,820
It's like amnesia.

3669
02:17:51,980 --> 02:17:52,640
You know?

3670
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,540
You hit your head again, you remember everything.

3671
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:55,740
When you get concussion, you just...

3672
02:17:55,740 --> 02:17:56,760
Guys, don't follow my deco...

3673
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:57,340
I'm not a doctor.

3674
02:17:57,460 --> 02:18:00,200
I might be like licensed in many things, but doctor isn't it.

3675
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:02,440
Just so you know.

3676
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:07,080
Just so you guys know.

3677
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:10,460
We might have a lot of licenses in multiple things.

3678
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:13,200
But anyway, as I was saying...

3679
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,420
We're gonna fix your concussion sir!

3680
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,740
This is like non-licensed medical advice.

3681
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:21,900
But like, you know, I think...

3682
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:24,560
In my opinion...

3683
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:26,900
You know how those twitter accounts were like...

3684
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,260
These are all just my opinion.

3685
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:31,540
I'm not associated with any company or like my...

3686
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:35,400
This is only my opinion.

3687
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:36,900
But like...

3688
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:40,300
I think if you like hit your head again...

3689
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:42,080
We can un-concuss your concussion.

3690
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:46,300
Wait, this way.

3691
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,660
I have to go this way, right?

3692
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:49,180
What other way do we go?

3693
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:53,200
In my opinion, this is a magic word.

3694
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:56,640
I fucking know, god.

3695
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:58,840
I'm literally doing it right now, god.

3696
02:18:59,020 --> 02:19:00,100
Where else am I?

3697
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:01,080
Oh, it's this way.

3698
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:02,100
Okay.

3699
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,640
God, I'm literally doing a thing.

3700
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:05,280
God.

3701
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:07,400
Wait, where the fuck am I?

3702
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:08,560
What is this?

3703
02:19:09,780 --> 02:19:10,280
What is this?

3704
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,120
I barely see it.

3705
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:12,460
Okay, here we go.

3706
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:13,560
Up we go.

3707
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:15,500
Up we go!

3708
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,580
Where do I jump after this?

3709
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:19,960
Like here?

3710
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:24,560
Like where do I jump?

3711
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:29,980
God is back seating me.

3712
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:31,980
God is like...

3713
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:33,320
Where do I go?

3714
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:33,800
Oh...

3715
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:38,800
Okay.

3716
02:19:40,340 --> 02:19:41,780
In my opinion, sir!

3717
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:45,220
If you keep hitting yourself against the wall, we'll fix the head concussion!

3718
02:19:45,800 --> 02:19:47,380
But this is just my opinion!

3719
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:54,320
You know, if I was wrong, it was you're the one that followed the opinion instead of getting actual, official medical advice!

3720
02:19:56,380 --> 02:19:57,240
That's your fault.

3721
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:00,160
And watch where the tower falls?

3722
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:00,480
Okay.

3723
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:02,580
Come on, knock it down!

3724
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:03,880
Hey, this way?

3725
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:05,940
Where is that man falling?

3726
02:20:07,580 --> 02:20:08,580
Where am I?

3727
02:20:15,990 --> 02:20:16,570
Oh...

3728
02:20:16,570 --> 02:20:17,270
Ow!

3729
02:20:18,970 --> 02:20:20,170
Get up, please!

3730
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:21,990
Get up!

3731
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:24,050
Where did I come from?

3732
02:20:24,210 --> 02:20:24,650
Here?

3733
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:26,550
Do I go up?

3734
02:20:27,610 --> 02:20:28,930
I must go up, right?

3735
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:31,030
Oh shit!

3736
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:36,890
Thank you for the taxi ride, I guess.

3737
02:20:37,790 --> 02:20:38,330
Sir, please!

3738
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:40,010
Give me a sec.

3739
02:20:41,630 --> 02:20:42,230
Alright.

3740
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:43,270
Up I go!

3741
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:44,610
Where do I go from here then?

3742
02:20:45,390 --> 02:20:46,290
Like here?

3743
02:20:48,130 --> 02:20:49,290
Where else would I go?

3744
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:50,950
Here?

3745
02:20:52,070 --> 02:20:53,470
Just down here?

3746
02:20:54,770 --> 02:20:55,510
Come on!

3747
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:56,970
Right here!

3748
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:01,930
Is the flower like my yellow spray?

3749
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:09,110
Is that supposed to represent the yellow spray?

3750
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:11,830
Oh, it is!

3751
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:17,910
Oh my god!

3752
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:19,950
The red flower is the new yellow paint!

3753
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:23,650
I brought down the roof!

3754
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:31,280
Oh my god!

3755
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:31,620
Finally!

3756
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,700
Where am I?

3757
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:35,340
Finally, but also where am I?

3758
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:37,200
How do I jump on his back though?

3759
02:21:38,740 --> 02:21:39,180
I don't know.

3760
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:39,700
I'm gonna do something.

3761
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:42,020
I see it.

3762
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:42,440
I see it.

3763
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:42,860
Do you see it?

3764
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,080
Circle emoji.

3765
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:44,780
Did you see that?

3766
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:48,100
There we go.

3767
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:51,560
Alright, it's time to fucking fix your back, sir!

3768
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:55,180
Just like how I fix your wife's back who's totally still alive!

3769
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,960
It's almost the same!

3770
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:03,580
Yes, she left you!

3771
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:05,260
She's not dead or anything.

3772
02:22:05,260 --> 02:22:07,120
She definitely just left you!

3773
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:09,460
That's it.

3774
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:10,380
Oh, nice.

3775
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:11,400
That nice.

3776
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,340
That nice.

3777
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:13,660
Not nice right now.

3778
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:15,700
Oh, fuck.

3779
02:22:15,820 --> 02:22:16,040
Okay.

3780
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:16,660
Bro!

3781
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:17,060
Bro!

3782
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:18,240
Calm the fuck down!

3783
02:22:19,140 --> 02:22:20,860
Your wife's like, oh my...

3784
02:22:20,860 --> 02:22:21,300
What?

3785
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:23,540
I'm up here now.

3786
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:24,480
Okay.

3787
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:29,720
Don't worry, I can make this jump, right?

3788
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:32,480
Yes, nice.

3789
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:34,340
Oh, thank god.

3790
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:36,920
Thank fucking god.

3791
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:37,980
Okay, now I can poke.

3792
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:39,500
Now I can like, fix his back.

3793
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:41,480
There we go.

3794
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:42,640
Let that juice out.

3795
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:43,540
There.

3796
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:45,640
Your wife loves it when I do this too.

3797
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:47,840
You're totally alive.

3798
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,240
Very much alive, wife.

3799
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:52,140
Look, it's not my fault she left you!

3800
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:53,140
Alright?

3801
02:22:53,240 --> 02:22:54,740
With like, no letter or anything too.

3802
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:55,700
That's so fucking weird.

3803
02:22:58,160 --> 02:22:59,280
That's so weird, man.

3804
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:01,160
That she like, left you with no letter or anything.

3805
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:02,100
She just disappeared.

3806
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:03,660
Like, where else would she go?

3807
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:08,120
And then you could never find out...

3808
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:10,160
And she never called back or anything.

3809
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:13,580
She even like, left all her belongings too at the house.

3810
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:14,840
It's like she never cared.

3811
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:17,080
Alright.

3812
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:20,420
Not even like, gave you like, any messages.

3813
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:22,120
Not even with a text or anything.

3814
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:23,500
You're very much a live wife.

3815
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:25,540
Oh my god.

3816
02:23:25,580 --> 02:23:25,880
Please!

3817
02:23:26,660 --> 02:23:28,140
Let me fix your back!

3818
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:31,900
I'm getting sad.

3819
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:34,140
Why?

3820
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:34,860
She's alive!

3821
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:37,660
She's very much alive!

3822
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:40,820
She just left with like, no other messages or anything.

3823
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:46,460
Like, all her belongings were still in the house too.

3824
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:47,560
It's so fucking weird.

3825
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:49,800
But like, there's no foul play.

3826
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:53,800
She needs to ram into something.

3827
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:55,700
Please ram into something right now.

3828
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:59,700
She needs to ram into something.

3829
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:02,500
Okay, fuck this.

3830
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:06,680
There you go.

3831
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:07,840
There you go.

3832
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:12,020
Little by little.

3833
02:24:12,140 --> 02:24:15,780
I will force myself to puncture your back for health reasons!

3834
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,260
It's so healthy!

3835
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:25,220
Take your sins!

3836
02:24:32,030 --> 02:24:32,810
Okay, nice.

3837
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,590
He just stuck there.

3838
02:24:34,170 --> 02:24:35,130
Did I glitch?

3839
02:24:35,130 --> 02:24:36,170
Did I glitch him?

3840
02:24:36,370 --> 02:24:37,410
Like, why is he not moving?

3841
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:39,470
Like, why is he not moving?

3842
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:43,110
Like, why is he not moving?

3843
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:43,270
Like, why is he not moving?

3844
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:43,630
He's not moving at all!

3845
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:48,050
Combo time!

3846
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:51,990
Oh my god.

3847
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:52,670
Oh my god.

3848
02:24:52,730 --> 02:24:54,490
I'm gonna combo this person.

3849
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:57,430
It's like when I put him in the corner in a fighting game.

3850
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:02,970
I think I fucked him.

3851
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:06,870
There you go.

3852
02:25:06,930 --> 02:25:07,810
Pro gamer.

3853
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:10,910
He's taking the treatment so well.

3854
02:25:10,950 --> 02:25:13,190
Oh my god, he's so relaxed that he just lied back.

3855
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:13,710
He's back in his back.

3856
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:15,290
He fell asleep.

3857
02:25:16,070 --> 02:25:17,150
Never punish.

3858
02:25:17,310 --> 02:25:17,650
Let's go.

3859
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:18,650
Woooo!

3860
02:25:20,330 --> 02:25:20,950
I'm here!

3861
02:25:29,130 --> 02:25:31,290
That's how you do it, Infinite!

3862
02:25:34,380 --> 02:25:35,290
We're doing it.

3863
02:25:35,430 --> 02:25:36,770
We're scheming so hard.

3864
02:25:38,290 --> 02:25:39,490
Is that my girlfriend?

3865
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:41,810
My very much alive girlfriend?

3866
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:45,110
Not like the guy's very much alive wife?

3867
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:51,130
Oh my god, so many happy customers.

3868
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:53,110
Guys, I think I'm doing it.

3869
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:58,370
Look at all these happy customers right there.

3870
02:26:04,230 --> 02:26:09,110
There's actually a spot on most, if not all, Colossi that you can grab and will never be shaken from.

3871
02:26:09,770 --> 02:26:10,370
Speedrunner Tech.

3872
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:11,350
Thank you for the super chat.

3873
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:11,710
Thank you.

3874
02:26:13,170 --> 02:26:13,690
It's gay.

3875
02:26:13,890 --> 02:26:14,650
I appreciate it.

3876
02:26:18,810 --> 02:26:19,510
There's two more?

3877
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:30,120
The next foe is...

3878
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:33,440
That has fallen into the valley.

3879
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:43,780
Thank you for the super chat.

3880
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:44,440
Thank you.

3881
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:48,100
I sit there and shake my head 48 times in a row too if you told me my wife was gone.

3882
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,320
Thank you for the super chat.

3883
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:49,760
Thank you.

3884
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:56,920
Yes, you're very much alive wife who left like no other evidence that she left you other than that she's gone.

3885
02:26:57,140 --> 02:27:00,260
It's so crazy that she even left all her belongings and her cash too.

3886
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,800
And like even the car.

3887
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,120
But like she's very much alive.

3888
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:05,000
There you go.

3889
02:27:09,560 --> 02:27:11,220
The very alive wife.

3890
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:13,740
Let's see.

3891
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:16,040
Where do we go?

3892
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:17,680
Oh yeah, we got to save to pray.

3893
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:19,040
Pray to save.

3894
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:23,140
Is this NTR or murder?

3895
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:24,000
You'll never know.

3896
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:27,440
That's a good question.

3897
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:29,740
Find out next time.

3898
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:32,000
On the next episode of Doki Bird.

3899
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:34,120
Alright, we got to save to pray.

3900
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:38,940
Of course it's not murder.

3901
02:27:39,060 --> 02:27:39,900
She's very much alive.

3902
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:44,460
This way.

3903
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:45,980
Alright.

3904
02:27:47,540 --> 02:27:54,980
This is like literally this entire like this play through has been 80% trying to figure out where the fuck I am.

3905
02:27:58,920 --> 02:27:59,880
I swear.

3906
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:00,900
We spend less time.

3907
02:28:00,920 --> 02:28:04,200
Other than that fucking terrible bird client.

3908
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:05,280
Other than that client.

3909
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:06,660
The air sack client.

3910
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:09,460
All the fucking colossi murder.

3911
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:11,200
Like sorry, colossi patient.

3912
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:16,120
Colossi clients have been pretty easy to deal with.

3913
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:19,780
Like my job has been pretty easy.

3914
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:24,220
What was that now?

3915
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:25,040
Patients.

3916
02:28:25,060 --> 02:28:25,520
Patients.

3917
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:25,860
Clients.

3918
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:30,460
My very much alive clients.

3919
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:31,820
Okay, this way.

3920
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:32,780
I'll go this way.

3921
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:35,840
No, no, no.

3922
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:37,440
You guys must have like had a...

3923
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:40,200
All of you guys must have had like a small stroke right there.

3924
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:41,080
What murder?

3925
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:42,300
I would never.

3926
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,180
Go Arlo, go.

3927
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,180
Go Arlo, go.

3928
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:55,480
I meant like a murder of crows.

3929
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:56,860
A group of crows, you know?

3930
02:28:56,860 --> 02:28:57,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3931
02:28:57,960 --> 02:29:00,260
You know, murder as in like a group, you know?

3932
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:03,640
Like, you know, when they say a group of crows and I say a murder of crows.

3933
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,460
It's like on the other side.

3934
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,580
How do I get there?

3935
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:09,280
How the fuck do I get there?

3936
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,100
Oh God, how do I...

3937
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:16,220
Where the fuck is that area?

3938
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:18,840
Have I been to that shrine?

3939
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:20,440
No, I haven't.

3940
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:22,260
Oh wait, that's... I've been to this shrine.

3941
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:29,260
Alright, let's grab this shrine first.

3942
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,340
Save the prey.

3943
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:32,420
Woo!

3944
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:34,500
There you go.

3945
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:35,320
Yay!

3946
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:38,120
We did it!

3947
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:40,900
Okay, where the fuck is the salamander?

3948
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,580
This might be our last salamander.

3949
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,720
Oh, there he is.

3950
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:46,440
God, he's all the way up there again.

3951
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:47,760
God damn it, get down from here.

3952
02:29:47,820 --> 02:29:49,000
You're not a fucking bird.

3953
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:52,020
Oh wait, nope.

3954
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:57,000
Nice.

3955
02:29:57,580 --> 02:29:59,520
Oh shit, he's like all the way up here.

3956
02:29:59,980 --> 02:30:00,420
No!

3957
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:02,200
No!

3958
02:30:02,260 --> 02:30:03,380
Don't know how to climb up there!

3959
02:30:07,270 --> 02:30:07,710
No.

3960
02:30:08,530 --> 02:30:10,710
No, you're not gonna have that privilege.

3961
02:30:11,410 --> 02:30:12,210
Where did he go?

3962
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:12,810
God damn it.

3963
02:30:13,090 --> 02:30:14,150
God damn it, that's right.

3964
02:30:14,590 --> 02:30:15,650
The fucking vibration.

3965
02:30:16,730 --> 02:30:17,170
No.

3966
02:30:17,510 --> 02:30:17,950
No!

3967
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:21,890
Where'd he go?

3968
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:23,790
Where did he go?

3969
02:30:25,390 --> 02:30:27,550
Where the fuck did he fucking walk to?

3970
02:30:28,070 --> 02:30:29,150
I hear him.

3971
02:30:32,010 --> 02:30:32,910
Where is he?

3972
02:30:37,370 --> 02:30:38,750
He's on the ground?

3973
02:30:39,210 --> 02:30:40,370
They can do that?

3974
02:30:41,890 --> 02:30:42,910
That's fucking right.

3975
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:44,610
That's fucking right, my man.

3976
02:30:46,490 --> 02:30:46,970
No.

3977
02:30:47,250 --> 02:30:47,730
No.

3978
02:30:48,690 --> 02:30:49,330
There you go.

3979
02:30:49,430 --> 02:30:50,190
I got it.

3980
02:30:50,770 --> 02:30:52,390
I got it, I'm gonna double kill you.

3981
02:30:54,510 --> 02:30:54,990
Nice.

3982
02:30:55,730 --> 02:30:56,210
Alright.

3983
02:30:56,790 --> 02:30:57,630
We did it.

3984
02:30:57,850 --> 02:30:59,390
Yeah, they walk on the ground now?

3985
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:00,210
I was like, what the fuck?

3986
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:01,530
You can be on the ground?

3987
02:31:03,570 --> 02:31:04,050
Alright.

3988
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:05,550
We did it.

3989
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:08,450
We fucking did it.

3990
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:09,430
Oh my gosh.

3991
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:10,530
It was so difficult.

3992
02:31:12,890 --> 02:31:14,530
Where is this last one?

3993
02:31:14,830 --> 02:31:15,990
It's like right here.

3994
02:31:16,490 --> 02:31:17,870
We go across this bridge?

3995
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:19,530
Right?

3996
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:21,730
I can't tell.

3997
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:24,590
Guys, do we go across this bridge, chat?

3998
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:27,190
Is it this bridge?

3999
02:31:28,030 --> 02:31:28,510
Okay.

4000
02:31:28,510 --> 02:31:29,430
I just wanna be sure.

4001
02:31:30,610 --> 02:31:31,050
Yep?

4002
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,710
No.

4003
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:32,090
Okay.

4004
02:31:32,270 --> 02:31:33,270
Who the fuck said that?

4005
02:31:33,370 --> 02:31:33,510
Wes.

4006
02:31:33,790 --> 02:31:34,230
Okay.

4007
02:31:34,310 --> 02:31:35,750
Two people said no.

4008
02:31:36,430 --> 02:31:37,590
More said yes.

4009
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:42,090
Wes, I'm gonna remember your name if you were wrong.

4010
02:31:42,470 --> 02:31:44,090
Do what you want.

4011
02:31:45,870 --> 02:31:47,190
Oh, this is the forest!

4012
02:31:48,770 --> 02:31:49,210
Wait.

4013
02:31:49,390 --> 02:31:50,410
This is the forest.

4014
02:31:50,450 --> 02:31:51,390
I don't think we go here.

4015
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,050
Wait.

4016
02:31:54,130 --> 02:31:55,170
I don't think this is it.

4017
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:57,070
Yeah, this is not the bridge.

4018
02:31:57,610 --> 02:31:58,410
We got...

4019
02:31:58,410 --> 02:31:58,630
Okay.

4020
02:31:58,750 --> 02:31:59,630
Wes might have been right.

4021
02:31:59,710 --> 02:32:00,590
Everybody else was wrong.

4022
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:03,790
No, we do not.

4023
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:07,150
Okay.

4024
02:32:07,330 --> 02:32:07,810
Okay.

4025
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:10,930
I remember like the other area led us to nowhere.

4026
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:12,430
It's not this bridge.

4027
02:32:12,550 --> 02:32:13,130
Oh my God.

4028
02:32:13,190 --> 02:32:14,890
In the end, Wes was right.

4029
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:16,690
I can't believe it.

4030
02:32:18,350 --> 02:32:21,050
I can't believe Wes was right all along.

4031
02:32:21,130 --> 02:32:22,130
He's lying.

4032
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,790
I'm sorry.

4033
02:32:25,230 --> 02:32:25,750
I'm sorry.

4034
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:27,050
I'm sorry.

4035
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:29,310
Don't listen to him.

4036
02:32:29,350 --> 02:32:29,990
He's lying.

4037
02:32:31,690 --> 02:32:32,170
Okay.

4038
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:32,690
This way.

4039
02:32:35,330 --> 02:32:36,030
All right.

4040
02:32:36,070 --> 02:32:36,590
Here we go.

4041
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:38,710
This has to be the right way.

4042
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,030
Yeah.

4043
02:32:41,230 --> 02:32:42,590
It has to be here.

4044
02:32:43,110 --> 02:32:44,370
Where else could it be?

4045
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:47,350
He's lying.

4046
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:49,830
I definitely have the guide open.

4047
02:32:51,830 --> 02:32:52,310
Okay.

4048
02:32:53,310 --> 02:32:53,930
All right.

4049
02:32:53,950 --> 02:32:55,170
Into the desert we go.

4050
02:32:56,550 --> 02:32:57,030
Okay.

4051
02:32:57,050 --> 02:32:57,310
I can't believe it.

4052
02:32:57,310 --> 02:32:59,030
It's like somewhere to our right.

4053
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:01,090
Father of the sand.

4054
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:01,710
Okay.

4055
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:02,590
Father of the sand.

4056
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:04,170
Who the fuck said yes before too?

4057
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:06,330
I need to remember that guy's name instead.

4058
02:33:06,650 --> 02:33:07,410
God damn it.

4059
02:33:07,510 --> 02:33:09,190
I remembered the wrong person's name.

4060
02:33:10,030 --> 02:33:13,090
I always need to remember the people that are wrong so I can gloat.

4061
02:33:14,290 --> 02:33:15,390
Behind the castle.

4062
02:33:15,490 --> 02:33:16,290
There's a castle?

4063
02:33:17,730 --> 02:33:19,410
I wonder if I can go right from here.

4064
02:33:20,350 --> 02:33:21,610
It has to be, right?

4065
02:33:22,870 --> 02:33:23,990
Where else would it be?

4066
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:25,410
I don't know.

4067
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:27,030
I don't know.

4068
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:28,670
There's like a passage here.

4069
02:33:29,790 --> 02:33:30,630
Oh, there it is!

4070
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:31,130
Is that a castle?

4071
02:33:31,590 --> 02:33:32,310
Oh, my God!

4072
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:32,810
That's a castle!

4073
02:33:34,770 --> 02:33:35,970
There is a castle!

4074
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:38,390
I'm not the only person here.

4075
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:41,310
A human has to make that castle.

4076
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:43,470
Oh, my God.

4077
02:33:43,490 --> 02:33:44,490
There's a shrine here, too.

4078
02:33:44,690 --> 02:33:45,270
Oh, my God.

4079
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:46,210
I get to eat another salamander.

4080
02:33:47,190 --> 02:33:47,790
All right.

4081
02:33:48,070 --> 02:33:48,930
Pray to save!

4082
02:33:55,540 --> 02:33:56,620
Pray to save!

4083
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:02,380
Where the fuck is the little bitch?

4084
02:34:02,560 --> 02:34:02,820
Oh, no!

4085
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:04,160
Oh, there he is!

4086
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:05,780
Okay.

4087
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:09,380
The vibration is gonna knock him off.

4088
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:11,280
God damn it, Arlo!

4089
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,480
Alright, there you go.

4090
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:19,660
Nice.

4091
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:22,840
Yummy!

4092
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:26,240
Alright, he gets to live.

4093
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:28,240
For my infinite food glitch.

4094
02:34:30,700 --> 02:34:32,940
You can't save all of them, Arlo.

4095
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:35,320
I'll eventually eat all the salamanders.

4096
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:36,580
Alright.

4097
02:34:37,940 --> 02:34:38,800
Here we go.

4098
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:39,680
This way.

4099
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:40,580
To the castle we go!

4100
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:43,480
He gets to live.

4101
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:47,060
That salamander needs to thank Arlo for saving him.

4102
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:49,880
I was just about to eat him too.

4103
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:52,560
This is like this way, right?

4104
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:55,520
That way to go in?

4105
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:56,720
This way?

4106
02:34:57,620 --> 02:35:00,240
What other way to get in is there?

4107
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:02,660
Just like this way?

4108
02:35:04,040 --> 02:35:05,300
Where is the castle?

4109
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:06,300
Castle door opening.

4110
02:35:06,860 --> 02:35:07,880
Oh, here!

4111
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:08,680
Found it!

4112
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:11,580
I found it!

4113
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:14,180
Wheeee!

4114
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:16,740
Wheeee!

4115
02:35:18,110 --> 02:35:18,250
Wheeee!

4116
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:20,190
Okay, there's a hole right here.

4117
02:35:20,450 --> 02:35:21,930
That means...

4118
02:35:21,930 --> 02:35:23,190
The hole is the goal.

4119
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:25,370
Okay, how the fuck?

4120
02:35:26,410 --> 02:35:27,150
How?

4121
02:35:28,850 --> 02:35:29,590
How?

4122
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:41,210
Oh, the wrong entrance!

4123
02:35:41,230 --> 02:35:42,630
There's another entrance?

4124
02:35:44,050 --> 02:35:45,610
There's a slope here.

4125
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:48,470
There's a front entrance?

4126
02:35:50,610 --> 02:35:51,510
Wait, what?

4127
02:35:52,570 --> 02:35:54,890
You mean there's more than one hole?

4128
02:35:55,850 --> 02:35:57,610
Guess we're gonna find out.

4129
02:35:59,050 --> 02:36:00,590
Wrong hole, apparently.

4130
02:36:01,090 --> 02:36:02,470
Oh my god, there is!

4131
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:03,810
What the fuck?

4132
02:36:05,050 --> 02:36:05,690
Guys!

4133
02:36:06,230 --> 02:36:07,350
Did you guys know?

4134
02:36:08,670 --> 02:36:10,510
God gave us more than one hole?

4135
02:36:10,610 --> 02:36:11,210
Oh, I see.

4136
02:36:11,210 --> 02:36:11,610
Hahaha!

4137
02:36:13,670 --> 02:36:14,150
Hahaha!

4138
02:36:16,770 --> 02:36:17,750
Hey, here we go.

4139
02:36:17,890 --> 02:36:18,350
I found it.

4140
02:36:21,030 --> 02:36:21,970
I found it.

4141
02:36:22,630 --> 02:36:23,110
Yeah!

4142
02:36:25,570 --> 02:36:32,670
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Ba-ba-dum-pa-pa-pa-pa Ba-ba-dum-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa I love that song.

4143
02:36:32,890 --> 02:36:33,810
I miss that group.

4144
02:36:36,130 --> 02:36:38,070
I love the songs they make.

4145
02:36:39,990 --> 02:36:41,190
I love the songs they make.

4146
02:36:41,190 --> 02:36:41,510
My friend Steve.

4147
02:36:41,730 --> 02:36:43,530
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da Steve.

4148
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:44,450
Hahaha!

4149
02:36:49,170 --> 02:36:49,610
Wow!

4150
02:36:49,610 --> 02:36:50,330
We did it!

4151
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:55,200
What the fuck?

4152
02:36:55,320 --> 02:36:55,860
Oh, it's this way.

4153
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:58,100
Guys, why the fuck are there random holes?

4154
02:36:58,320 --> 02:36:59,660
It's baiting me so hard.

4155
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:03,080
Oh, you don't know that song?

4156
02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:04,940
And my friend Steve.

4157
02:37:05,140 --> 02:37:06,880
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Steve.

4158
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:07,400
Wait.

4159
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:09,280
This is actually one of my favorite songs.

4160
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:09,780
It's so funny.

4161
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:10,800
Hahaha!

4162
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:11,520
Hahaha!

4163
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:15,160
My friend Steve.

4164
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:17,380
I can't believe it!

4165
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,500
Me, you, and Steve!

4166
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:19,740
Hahaha!

4167
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:23,340
It's Garfunkel and Oates.

4168
02:37:23,640 --> 02:37:23,720
It's Garfunkel and Oates.

4169
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:25,980
One...

4170
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:29,120
They also have like a lot of other really good videos.

4171
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:29,500
They also have like a lot of other really good videos.

4172
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:32,200
A lot of other really good songs too.

4173
02:37:32,660 --> 02:37:33,220
Here.

4174
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:35,120
Hahaha!

4175
02:37:35,240 --> 02:37:37,540
It's 15 years ago!

4176
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:38,180
It's 15 years ago!

4177
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:39,160
Holy fuck!

4178
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:40,180
Bro.

4179
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:41,420
It was a good song.

4180
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:42,220
Hahaha!

4181
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:47,160
Alright.

4182
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:49,700
No, I'm not listening to this song on my stream.

4183
02:37:49,900 --> 02:37:52,340
I have enough fucking copyright strikes, guys.

4184
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:53,240
Hahaha!

4185
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:56,280
Music people have taken enough of my money.

4186
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:58,880
Hahaha!

4187
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,200
Up we go.

4188
02:38:01,060 --> 02:38:03,860
Can you not run up C's, Mr. Protagonist?

4189
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:05,020
Bro!

4190
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,600
What the fuck is he?

4191
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:09,880
What the fuck is he?

4192
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:11,840
He's a giant, right?

4193
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:13,700
Then where is he being a giant at?

4194
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:17,720
Where is he?

4195
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:18,280
Hello?

4196
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:19,200
Giant?

4197
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:19,840
Sir?

4198
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:23,500
Steve, ba-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.

4199
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:25,560
Steve, ba-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.

4200
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:25,840
Hey!

4201
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:27,480
Where is he?

4202
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:28,740
Giant, sir!

4203
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:30,820
Giant!

4204
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:34,180
Where are you?

4205
02:38:35,980 --> 02:38:38,520
If you're such a giant, why can't I see you?

4206
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:39,700
Hmm.

4207
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:50,300
Oh!

4208
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:51,280
There, I see you now.

4209
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:51,920
Hahaha!

4210
02:38:54,140 --> 02:38:54,620
Whoa!

4211
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:55,200
Hey!

4212
02:38:57,070 --> 02:38:57,450
You know what?

4213
02:38:57,450 --> 02:38:58,750
They were right about you.

4214
02:38:58,770 --> 02:38:59,770
You were pretty big.

4215
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:00,790
Whoa!

4216
02:39:03,570 --> 02:39:04,430
King Kong.

4217
02:39:05,210 --> 02:39:09,630
Bro, I didn't mean it when I said I couldn't find you and that you might be short.

4218
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:11,990
It was just a hee-hee funny joke!

4219
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:14,990
Fuck you, Ox-I.

4220
02:39:17,730 --> 02:39:19,110
God, what do I do?

4221
02:39:19,110 --> 02:39:19,630
Hahaha!

4222
02:39:20,670 --> 02:39:21,150
God!

4223
02:39:23,290 --> 02:39:24,770
God, help me!

4224
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:28,770
Oh!

4225
02:39:28,990 --> 02:39:29,470
Shit!

4226
02:39:29,630 --> 02:39:30,490
I don't think he liked it.

4227
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:32,130
I don't think he liked that.

4228
02:39:33,450 --> 02:39:34,670
God, what do I do?

4229
02:39:34,710 --> 02:39:34,950
God!

4230
02:39:36,050 --> 02:39:37,910
Oh my god, can I climb anything?

4231
02:39:38,430 --> 02:39:41,630
Can I... Can I climb anything around here?

4232
02:39:43,870 --> 02:39:44,710
God, please.

4233
02:39:45,130 --> 02:39:45,610
God.

4234
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:46,770
God, it's time.

4235
02:39:48,530 --> 02:39:48,990
Goal.

4236
02:39:49,430 --> 02:39:49,890
Survive.

4237
02:39:51,710 --> 02:39:52,510
Oh no.

4238
02:39:53,070 --> 02:39:53,770
Oh no.

4239
02:39:54,230 --> 02:39:56,470
King Kong's gonna fucking grab me, man.

4240
02:39:57,390 --> 02:39:58,130
Okay, I'm running.

4241
02:39:58,290 --> 02:39:58,870
I'm running.

4242
02:39:58,950 --> 02:40:00,430
There has to be a thing to climb.

4243
02:40:00,670 --> 02:40:02,070
This has to be climbable.

4244
02:40:02,190 --> 02:40:02,390
Nope.

4245
02:40:02,650 --> 02:40:03,110
Okay.

4246
02:40:03,190 --> 02:40:04,210
This has to... Nope.

4247
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:06,830
Yes.

4248
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:10,050
There has to be something out there that's climbable.

4249
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:12,830
Climb him?

4250
02:40:13,370 --> 02:40:13,830
Where?

4251
02:40:15,430 --> 02:40:16,150
Oh god.

4252
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:16,550
Oh god.

4253
02:40:16,770 --> 02:40:17,210
This is climbable?

4254
02:40:17,350 --> 02:40:18,950
This has to be climbable.

4255
02:40:19,770 --> 02:40:20,670
Climbable, please!

4256
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:22,610
Where are the climbing parts?

4257
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:26,730
I used to be able to climb everything!

4258
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:28,650
Oh no.

4259
02:40:28,890 --> 02:40:29,690
Oh no.

4260
02:40:49,130 --> 02:40:49,690
Panels!

4261
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:51,330
God, please!

4262
02:40:51,430 --> 02:40:52,490
I'm struggling, God!

4263
02:40:53,150 --> 02:40:54,770
God, show me the way.

4264
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:57,090
Okay, his head is his heart.

4265
02:40:58,030 --> 02:40:58,590
Okay.

4266
02:40:59,050 --> 02:41:00,070
Oh my god.

4267
02:41:00,130 --> 02:41:00,670
There's panels?

4268
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:02,850
Ah!

4269
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:07,260
Is this a panel?

4270
02:41:08,330 --> 02:41:08,660
Are

4271
02:41:12,810 --> 02:41:13,830
these panels?

4272
02:41:14,170 --> 02:41:16,510
There's so many squares around.

4273
02:41:17,530 --> 02:41:18,190
There's...

4274
02:41:19,050 --> 02:41:19,710
There's...

4275
02:41:19,710 --> 02:41:21,270
There's so many squares.

4276
02:41:28,050 --> 02:41:29,090
Find a place.

4277
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:30,070
I'm trying!

4278
02:41:30,310 --> 02:41:31,050
I can't climb!

4279
02:41:34,990 --> 02:41:36,490
Oh my god.

4280
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:37,210
This is climbable.

4281
02:41:37,210 --> 02:41:38,070
Guys!

4282
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:40,890
I'm figuring out the climb!

4283
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:43,430
And then I jump here!

4284
02:41:45,730 --> 02:41:46,590
And then...

4285
02:41:46,590 --> 02:41:47,530
Alright.

4286
02:41:48,610 --> 02:41:49,910
And then what do I do?

4287
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:51,810
And then... Okay, no.

4288
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:53,230
No, okay.

4289
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:54,570
Alright.

4290
02:41:54,710 --> 02:41:55,870
I'm gonna make you stop here.

4291
02:41:55,970 --> 02:41:57,630
This is apparently...

4292
02:41:58,450 --> 02:42:01,050
This is apparently a panel.

4293
02:42:01,250 --> 02:42:01,750
I think.

4294
02:42:04,670 --> 02:42:06,170
Yeah, I don't know about this one either.

4295
02:42:06,170 --> 02:42:08,110
Wait, he's walking a ramp right away.

4296
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:09,910
Am I not like...

4297
02:42:10,870 --> 02:42:11,870
Guys, I'm important.

4298
02:42:12,190 --> 02:42:12,610
Sir?

4299
02:42:13,570 --> 02:42:14,010
Sir?

4300
02:42:15,890 --> 02:42:16,330
Sir?

4301
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:17,190
Sir?

4302
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:17,910
I'm important too!

4303
02:42:18,790 --> 02:42:19,710
Sir, you're like...

4304
02:42:20,270 --> 02:42:20,930
Please sir!

4305
02:42:21,010 --> 02:42:22,330
Oh my god, I did one damage guys.

4306
02:42:22,470 --> 02:42:22,870
I did it.

4307
02:42:24,850 --> 02:42:26,910
Guys, I think the queue was happening.

4308
02:42:27,250 --> 02:42:27,550
Okay.

4309
02:42:30,290 --> 02:42:31,470
Don't put the queue like that.

4310
02:42:31,550 --> 02:42:32,530
You look a little mosquito.

4311
02:42:32,530 --> 02:42:32,870
Okay.

4312
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:35,530
Is he gonna stomp on this?

4313
02:42:35,710 --> 02:42:36,970
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

4314
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:37,870
Stomp?

4315
02:42:41,290 --> 02:42:42,570
One damage.

4316
02:42:42,590 --> 02:42:43,850
Let's fucking go.

4317
02:42:44,010 --> 02:42:45,170
What is he looking at?

4318
02:42:46,910 --> 02:42:47,470
Boop!

4319
02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:49,390
Boop!

4320
02:42:49,430 --> 02:42:50,350
What's he gonna do?

4321
02:42:53,450 --> 02:42:54,090
Hello?

4322
02:42:55,730 --> 02:42:57,750
What is he even gonna do?

4323
02:43:00,070 --> 02:43:00,710
Nothing!

4324
02:43:00,990 --> 02:43:01,470
He's stuck!

4325
02:43:02,530 --> 02:43:03,130
Look at him!

4326
02:43:03,130 --> 02:43:04,370
Look at that little coward!

4327
02:43:05,490 --> 02:43:06,550
Look at him!

4328
02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:08,490
He's fucking stuck like a baby!

4329
02:43:08,870 --> 02:43:09,970
Am I doing something?

4330
02:43:11,810 --> 02:43:12,850
Do anything!

4331
02:43:15,650 --> 02:43:16,690
Do anything!

4332
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:16,890
Woo!

4333
02:43:17,410 --> 02:43:17,610
Woo!

4334
02:43:18,050 --> 02:43:19,490
Oh my god, I did it!

4335
02:43:19,810 --> 02:43:22,010
Oh my god, I'm so fucking smart!

4336
02:43:22,410 --> 02:43:23,870
I fucking did it!

4337
02:43:24,010 --> 02:43:25,650
He stepped on the panel.

4338
02:43:25,810 --> 02:43:26,770
I pulled his own.

4339
02:43:27,390 --> 02:43:28,810
Okay, now I'm up here.

4340
02:43:29,970 --> 02:43:31,310
Now I'm up here.

4341
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:31,670
Now I'm up here.

4342
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:33,470
What do I do now?

4343
02:43:34,330 --> 02:43:35,350
Is he gonna...

4344
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:37,170
Is he gonna duck down?

4345
02:43:38,790 --> 02:43:40,370
He made me a little ladder.

4346
02:43:40,890 --> 02:43:42,670
Maybe he's a good guy after all.

4347
02:43:43,850 --> 02:43:44,490
Wait, wait!

4348
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:44,990
Do you see that?

4349
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:47,650
Do you see that on his arm?

4350
02:43:48,270 --> 02:43:50,050
It's like a little pimple that I'm gonna poke!

4351
02:43:50,730 --> 02:43:52,170
That I'm missing every shot!

4352
02:43:52,750 --> 02:43:52,930
Hahaha!

4353
02:43:55,630 --> 02:43:57,070
Bro, it's your weak spot!

4354
02:43:59,170 --> 02:43:59,650
Bro, it's your weak spot!

4355
02:43:59,650 --> 02:43:59,790
Okay.

4356
02:44:01,270 --> 02:44:01,970
No!

4357
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:03,010
Don't leave me!

4358
02:44:03,930 --> 02:44:05,090
I'm a threat!

4359
02:44:06,370 --> 02:44:07,070
Sir!

4360
02:44:09,570 --> 02:44:10,270
Okay.

4361
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:11,890
Come on!

4362
02:44:12,210 --> 02:44:13,130
I'm mean!

4363
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:15,330
Come on!

4364
02:44:15,490 --> 02:44:17,230
I'm a scary mean person!

4365
02:44:17,490 --> 02:44:18,050
Come on!

4366
02:44:24,390 --> 02:44:26,290
I need to turn around.

4367
02:44:26,630 --> 02:44:27,330
No!

4368
02:44:29,250 --> 02:44:32,570
Bro, give me your arm!

4369
02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:33,650
Give me your arm!

4370
02:44:36,770 --> 02:44:37,330
Bro!

4371
02:44:39,310 --> 02:44:40,370
Look at me!

4372
02:44:40,530 --> 02:44:41,150
I'm threatening!

4373
02:44:41,530 --> 02:44:42,370
Look at my hand!

4374
02:44:42,770 --> 02:44:43,890
Look at my bow!

4375
02:44:45,410 --> 02:44:46,130
Come on!

4376
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:46,710
Turn around!

4377
02:44:47,070 --> 02:44:47,730
Turn around.

4378
02:44:52,890 --> 02:44:54,010
Stop moving!

4379
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:55,550
He's ghosting me.

4380
02:44:55,770 --> 02:44:57,910
He says I'm not scary enough for him.

4381
02:44:58,130 --> 02:44:58,750
That's fucked up.

4382
02:44:59,970 --> 02:45:03,890
I built up a clientele that deserves to be noticed, sir.

4383
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:06,390
Now turn around.

4384
02:45:09,330 --> 02:45:10,890
Is he gonna do a growl at me?

4385
02:45:13,070 --> 02:45:13,830
What's he doing?

4386
02:45:16,410 --> 02:45:18,310
Is he trying to have a conversation with me?

4387
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:19,330
Hahaha!

4388
02:45:20,390 --> 02:45:23,160
Oh shit!

4389
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:23,600
Okay.

4390
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:26,780
Oh my god, he's having a tamper tantrum right now.

4391
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:29,120
Bro, how the fuck is this knocking me around?

4392
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:30,580
Oh shit!

4393
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:32,040
Okay.

4394
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:34,340
He's pro-situated.

4395
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:38,120
Bro, I'm trying to help!

4396
02:45:38,580 --> 02:45:40,520
I'm gonna shoot you in the ass if you don't let me help you.

4397
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:41,380
Oh, fuck.

4398
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:41,680
Okay.

4399
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:43,380
He's like ignoring me.

4400
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:45,680
Bro, am I not important?

4401
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,480
Guys.

4402
02:45:51,260 --> 02:45:51,740
Guys.

4403
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:52,800
Am I...

4404
02:45:53,480 --> 02:45:54,680
Am I not important?

4405
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:58,560
No way.

4406
02:45:58,720 --> 02:45:59,080
No.

4407
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:00,620
There's no way I'm relevant, right?

4408
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:01,840
No way.

4409
02:46:02,020 --> 02:46:03,600
I have to be relevant, right?

4410
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:06,460
No!

4411
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:07,460
Not that way!

4412
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:09,420
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4413
02:46:09,420 --> 02:46:10,300
You were turning around!

4414
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:12,720
Go up higher?

4415
02:46:12,800 --> 02:46:13,800
I can climb up higher?

4416
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:15,120
Wait.

4417
02:46:15,700 --> 02:46:16,440
I can?

4418
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:18,340
Where?

4419
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:23,000
Oh my god.

4420
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:24,760
Guys.

4421
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:26,340
No.

4422
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:27,940
How?

4423
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:32,660
I... this?

4424
02:46:39,030 --> 02:46:40,210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4425
02:46:40,210 --> 02:46:40,850
That's an accident!

4426
02:46:40,990 --> 02:46:41,150
No!

4427
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:44,760
No, that's an accident!

4428
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:45,080
Please!

4429
02:46:46,980 --> 02:46:48,280
No, but steady.

4430
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:49,640
That's an accident!

4431
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:51,780
Turn your fucking head!

4432
02:46:52,060 --> 02:46:54,820
Please, for the love of God, just let me shoot you in the arm.

4433
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:57,900
Let me shoot you on the fucking arm!

4434
02:47:01,220 --> 02:47:01,620
Please!

4435
02:47:06,040 --> 02:47:08,200
Bro, please, for the love of God.

4436
02:47:08,800 --> 02:47:09,840
Just turn around.

4437
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:11,460
I need your other arm.

4438
02:47:11,500 --> 02:47:13,120
Your other arm has the weak point.

4439
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:14,720
There's no weak point here.

4440
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:20,700
There's literally no weak point!

4441
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:21,720
Stop moving.

4442
02:47:22,300 --> 02:47:22,780
Okay.

4443
02:47:24,820 --> 02:47:25,720
I'm trying.

4444
02:47:26,360 --> 02:47:27,740
I'm trying so hard.

4445
02:47:28,340 --> 02:47:29,120
I swear.

4446
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:30,780
Come on.

4447
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:31,380
Okay, that's right.

4448
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:31,860
That's me.

4449
02:47:32,320 --> 02:47:32,980
That's me.

4450
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,020
Now, give me your arm.

4451
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:35,680
Give me your arm.

4452
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:36,020
Give me your arm.

4453
02:47:36,040 --> 02:47:36,440
Give me your little poke.

4454
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:37,860
Yes.

4455
02:47:38,060 --> 02:47:38,460
Yes.

4456
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:39,360
I move that.

4457
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:39,740
Yep.

4458
02:47:40,460 --> 02:47:40,960
Yep.

4459
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:42,380
I move that arm.

4460
02:47:42,580 --> 02:47:43,200
Come on.

4461
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:44,820
You know you want to.

4462
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:47,340
You know you want to.

4463
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:52,600
Look, I did damage.

4464
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:53,800
Ow!

4465
02:47:54,780 --> 02:47:59,420
But look at the damage I did, though.

4466
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:04,480
But look at that damage I did.

4467
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:07,380
Please, just show me your other...

4468
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:08,340
Oh my God.

4469
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:12,660
Show me your other arm!

4470
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:15,320
That's all I want!

4471
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:25,270
Bro, I fucking swear.

4472
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:28,350
I fucking swear.

4473
02:48:29,770 --> 02:48:32,530
Just try and hit something.

4474
02:48:32,810 --> 02:48:33,370
Anything!

4475
02:48:37,850 --> 02:48:39,170
Oh my God!

4476
02:48:39,190 --> 02:48:39,750
Finally!

4477
02:48:39,750 --> 02:48:41,330
Oh, I'm okay.

4478
02:48:41,990 --> 02:48:42,950
I'm okay.

4479
02:48:43,170 --> 02:48:45,570
But he fucking finally did it.

4480
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:47,250
Holy shit!

4481
02:48:47,370 --> 02:48:49,070
Are you fucking kidding me?

4482
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:51,150
Oh, now you...

4483
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:54,010
Okay, now you fucking...

4484
02:48:54,590 --> 02:48:55,150
Okay.

4485
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:56,690
We did it, guys.

4486
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:59,990
It took him 20 years, but we fucking did it.

4487
02:49:00,310 --> 02:49:02,410
I don't know why it took him that long.

4488
02:49:03,270 --> 02:49:06,490
This had to be the longest strike of my life.

4489
02:49:06,610 --> 02:49:08,630
I watched him dance longer than this.

4490
02:49:09,310 --> 02:49:09,750
Like...

4491
02:49:12,410 --> 02:49:15,970
I spent more of the time watching him fucking dance.

4492
02:49:16,370 --> 02:49:17,590
Where does he strike here?

4493
02:49:18,610 --> 02:49:19,870
Did you make him strike here?

4494
02:49:21,590 --> 02:49:23,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4495
02:49:25,650 --> 02:49:26,090
Here?

4496
02:49:29,370 --> 02:49:30,530
Okay, maybe here.

4497
02:49:31,510 --> 02:49:32,710
Oh my God, there's...

4498
02:49:32,710 --> 02:49:33,270
He

4499
02:49:38,290 --> 02:49:39,490
wants to know...

4500
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:40,870
I will be the one to...

4501
02:49:40,870 --> 02:49:41,690
What did I do, dummy?

4502
02:49:44,110 --> 02:49:45,030
What did I do?

4503
02:49:46,750 --> 02:49:47,490
I hit it.

4504
02:49:47,610 --> 02:49:48,250
What now?

4505
02:49:50,470 --> 02:49:52,150
Okay, now he just has his arm.

4506
02:49:52,290 --> 02:49:53,510
What if I just do it again?

4507
02:49:55,250 --> 02:49:55,650
Oh.

4508
02:49:55,870 --> 02:49:56,730
Okay, nevermind.

4509
02:49:58,490 --> 02:49:59,290
What now?

4510
02:49:59,550 --> 02:50:00,550
Is he gonna pick it back up?

4511
02:50:02,970 --> 02:50:04,110
Nice, I fixed his arm.

4512
02:50:04,630 --> 02:50:05,670
I gave him a shot.

4513
02:50:06,250 --> 02:50:08,110
Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.

4514
02:50:09,850 --> 02:50:10,570
Can he...

4515
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:12,150
Is he gonna slam this?

4516
02:50:12,910 --> 02:50:13,630
Go to the...

4517
02:50:13,630 --> 02:50:13,950
What is this?

4518
02:50:14,090 --> 02:50:14,230
There's a bridge.

4519
02:50:14,230 --> 02:50:15,310
Oh, there's a bridge.

4520
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:18,490
There's stairs.

4521
02:50:18,990 --> 02:50:20,970
Guys, there's fucking stairs.

4522
02:50:22,070 --> 02:50:23,350
Oh my God.

4523
02:50:24,050 --> 02:50:25,650
There's stairs, guys.

4524
02:50:25,790 --> 02:50:26,650
I did it.

4525
02:50:26,710 --> 02:50:27,850
I found the stairs.

4526
02:50:28,990 --> 02:50:32,270
Can't believe we wouldn't slam down for so long.

4527
02:50:32,710 --> 02:50:33,370
Wait, maybe that's...

4528
02:50:33,370 --> 02:50:34,130
I'll need a sword here.

4529
02:50:36,350 --> 02:50:36,770
Here we go.

4530
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:38,830
Fight me.

4531
02:50:39,930 --> 02:50:41,270
Fight me right here.

4532
02:50:41,730 --> 02:50:43,490
Now I'm taller than you.

4533
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:45,330
That means I'm more important!

4534
02:50:46,330 --> 02:50:47,710
That's fucking right!

4535
02:50:48,890 --> 02:50:50,010
Get a little closer.

4536
02:50:51,710 --> 02:50:52,450
Come on.

4537
02:50:52,470 --> 02:50:53,570
Try to jump on him.

4538
02:50:54,370 --> 02:50:55,110
What's he gonna do?

4539
02:50:55,150 --> 02:50:55,550
Slap?

4540
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:57,450
He's gonna slam it.

4541
02:50:57,510 --> 02:50:58,750
He actually is gonna slam it!

4542
02:51:02,690 --> 02:51:03,170
Guys,

4543
02:51:07,090 --> 02:51:07,750
it was crazy.

4544
02:51:07,810 --> 02:51:09,190
He actually did the thing.

4545
02:51:13,090 --> 02:51:14,690
Holy fuck damn.

4546
02:51:15,190 --> 02:51:16,530
Oh my god.

4547
02:51:16,590 --> 02:51:18,270
He actually slammed it.

4548
02:51:18,350 --> 02:51:19,450
Who would've thought?

4549
02:51:20,270 --> 02:51:20,830
That's

4550
02:51:24,980 --> 02:51:26,340
fucking crazy, man.

4551
02:51:27,420 --> 02:51:29,140
He actually did it.

4552
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:31,380
Alright.

4553
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:33,460
I need him to stomp on here.

4554
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,460
Who's taller now?

4555
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:38,340
Guys, I need him to stomp on this.

4556
02:51:38,920 --> 02:51:39,940
On me.

4557
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:40,320
On me.

4558
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:40,720
Right here.

4559
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:41,180
That's me.

4560
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:42,500
That's me.

4561
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:43,320
That's me.

4562
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:43,520
It's me, sir.

4563
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:43,900
Yes.

4564
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:44,520
It's me.

4565
02:51:44,900 --> 02:51:45,340
Please.

4566
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:46,960
I wanna be tall just like you.

4567
02:51:47,020 --> 02:51:47,700
And not blow up.

4568
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:48,420
Please.

4569
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:49,740
Stomp on this.

4570
02:51:49,880 --> 02:51:50,140
Yes.

4571
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:51,740
Wooo!

4572
02:51:52,120 --> 02:51:52,560
Ow.

4573
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:54,120
That's alright.

4574
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:55,080
That's alright.

4575
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:55,720
Thank you, sir.

4576
02:51:56,020 --> 02:51:57,820
Thank you for the little booster seat.

4577
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:00,720
And then... climb up.

4578
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:02,120
Climb up.

4579
02:52:02,380 --> 02:52:02,820
Yes!

4580
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:03,520
Oh fuck.

4581
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:04,260
How did I miss?

4582
02:52:05,700 --> 02:52:07,880
There was like only one way to jump.

4583
02:52:07,900 --> 02:52:08,580
And I still missed.

4584
02:52:09,640 --> 02:52:10,380
Oh my god.

4585
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:11,480
This is so hard to see.

4586
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:12,980
From this angle.

4587
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:14,240
Alright.

4588
02:52:14,460 --> 02:52:15,360
Where is it?

4589
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:16,500
Here?

4590
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:17,960
Oh there it is.

4591
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:18,480
There's the stairs.

4592
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:20,080
Boop.

4593
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:22,280
Stair time.

4594
02:52:22,440 --> 02:52:22,900
Stair time.

4595
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:24,780
Yeeeah!

4596
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:27,920
Don't worry.

4597
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:28,440
We got this.

4598
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:30,400
Alright.

4599
02:52:31,740 --> 02:52:32,740
I am here.

4600
02:52:32,840 --> 02:52:35,280
Ready for our appointment for real this time.

4601
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:38,600
He was a little feisty.

4602
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:39,900
But we did it.

4603
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:40,680
We convinced him.

4604
02:52:40,880 --> 02:52:42,720
I guess I just jump on him from here.

4605
02:52:44,140 --> 02:52:44,720
That's right.

4606
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:45,360
Get over here.

4607
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:47,320
We are not behind schedule.

4608
02:52:47,880 --> 02:52:49,440
Because you wouldn't fucking swing.

4609
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:52,280
The other side?

4610
02:52:52,460 --> 02:52:53,360
Why the other side?

4611
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:55,280
I can make it from here.

4612
02:52:55,380 --> 02:52:55,700
Watch.

4613
02:52:58,740 --> 02:52:59,260
Oh!

4614
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:00,500
Oh!

4615
02:53:02,380 --> 02:53:02,900
Okay.

4616
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:03,820
Okay.

4617
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:05,860
I actually did not think it would work.

4618
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:06,480
But...

4619
02:53:20,700 --> 02:53:21,740
First try.

4620
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:22,460
First try.

4621
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:23,840
I can punch your time.

4622
02:53:24,180 --> 02:53:25,180
Let's let it go.

4623
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:30,560
Who said other side?

4624
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:32,960
This is a doki way.

4625
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:38,160
Never doubted.

4626
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,440
Where are my believers?

4627
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:42,640
Where are my believers in chat?

4628
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:47,640
That's fucking right.

4629
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:48,820
It was for you guys.

4630
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Nice speed.

4631
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:52,380
But fucking other side.

4632
02:53:54,840 --> 02:53:56,800
I don't need other sides.

4633
02:53:56,980 --> 02:53:58,380
I just need one side.

4634
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:00,860
All according to plan.

4635
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:02,360
Oh wait.

4636
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:03,060
It's gone now.

4637
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:03,660
Oh wait.

4638
02:54:03,740 --> 02:54:04,300
What the fuck?

4639
02:54:04,420 --> 02:54:04,700
Wait.

4640
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:04,960
What?

4641
02:54:05,340 --> 02:54:05,920
Wait.

4642
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:06,440
Excuse me?

4643
02:54:08,740 --> 02:54:09,900
Excuse me?

4644
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,540
What do you mean it's gone?

4645
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:12,960
Wow!

4646
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:13,580
Shit!

4647
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:17,000
Excuse me?

4648
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:17,520
Excuse me?

4649
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:18,800
Excuse me?

4650
02:54:18,820 --> 02:54:19,640
Where is your...

4651
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:21,780
Where are your other spots?

4652
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:27,920
There's other spots?

4653
02:54:30,560 --> 02:54:33,580
There's other spots that you need help on?

4654
02:54:33,800 --> 02:54:33,960
Oh!

4655
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:34,820
I see it!

4656
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:36,280
It's right there!

4657
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:38,500
Right?

4658
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:40,320
Is it...

4659
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:41,820
Is it right over there?

4660
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:44,420
Oh no.

4661
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:45,960
I'm gonna recharge real fast.

4662
02:54:46,300 --> 02:54:47,880
I'm gonna stay up here and recharge.

4663
02:54:48,820 --> 02:54:49,400
We'll be fine.

4664
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,040
We'll be fine.

4665
02:54:51,080 --> 02:54:54,060
He's just being a little feisty right now.

4666
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:54,800
We'll be fine.

4667
02:54:56,420 --> 02:54:56,940
Wait.

4668
02:54:57,020 --> 02:54:57,100
No.

4669
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,920
That's the spot to drop the sword.

4670
02:54:59,300 --> 02:55:00,480
Did you see it?

4671
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:01,560

What the fuck?

4673
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:03,340
He had other spots?

4674
02:55:08,380 --> 02:55:08,900
No.

4675
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:10,400
I know what I'm doing.

4676
02:55:10,480 --> 02:55:11,180
I'm a professional.

4677
02:55:12,040 --> 02:55:13,660
I get paid for this.

4678
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:16,680
I don't totally know where it is.

4679
02:55:17,720 --> 02:55:18,240
AHHHHHHHHH!

4680
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:19,340

4681
02:55:19,480 --> 02:55:19,960
No.

4682
02:55:20,140 --> 02:55:21,620

4685
02:55:26,760 --> 02:55:28,100
Oh it's his head.

4686
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:29,780
What the fuck?

4687
02:55:33,390 --> 02:55:35,230

4688
02:55:35,710 --> 02:55:39,230

4690
02:55:42,450 --> 02:55:43,310
What the fuck?

4691
02:55:43,470 --> 02:55:43,950
Where?

4692
02:55:44,150 --> 02:55:45,970
How the fuck do I just hit the head?

4693
02:55:46,510 --> 02:55:48,430
How the fuck do I just hit the head?

4694
02:55:48,470 --> 02:55:49,370
Did I shoot him?

4695
02:55:49,610 --> 02:55:51,190
What if I just keep shooting the head?

4696
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:52,230
Okay.

4697
02:55:52,350 --> 02:55:53,270

4698
02:55:54,650 --> 02:55:55,050
Okay.

4699
02:55:55,070 --> 02:55:56,670
Maybe he like goes up here.

4700
02:55:56,990 --> 02:55:57,390
Okay.

4701
02:55:57,390 --> 02:55:57,390
Maybe he like goes up here.

4702
02:55:57,390 --> 02:55:58,450
And then I just like...

4703
02:55:59,270 --> 02:56:00,350
Just hold his hand.

4704
02:56:00,570 --> 02:56:00,850
Come on.

4705
02:56:00,890 --> 02:56:01,170
Right here.

4706
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:03,070
Step on this.

4707
02:56:05,010 --> 02:56:05,870
Step on it.

4708
02:56:06,450 --> 02:56:07,070
Oh god.

4709
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:07,810

02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:09,910
Okay.

4711
02:56:09,990 --> 02:56:10,190

4712
02:56:10,250 --> 02:56:10,470
Not yet.

4713
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:10,750
Not yet.

4714
02:56:10,810 --> 02:56:10,950
Not yet.

4715
02:56:11,050 --> 02:56:11,510
Don't watch it.

4716
02:56:11,550 --> 02:56:12,050
Don't watch it.

4717
02:56:12,170 --> 02:56:13,610
Am I okay?

4718
02:56:13,810 --> 02:56:14,290

I'm gonna hold... watch this.

4721
02:56:17,850 --> 02:56:19,350
He's gonna get close to me.

4722
02:56:19,350 --> 02:56:20,610
And then I'm gonna hold the head.

4723
02:56:21,070 --> 02:56:22,050
Oh my god.

4724
02:56:23,370 --> 02:56:24,770
It's right in the head.

4725
02:56:25,030 --> 02:56:25,830
How the fuck?

4726
02:56:28,970 --> 02:56:31,390
Are there... Is there fur on the head?

4727
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:32,390
I can't tell.

4728
02:56:35,410 --> 02:56:36,910
I can't tell if the...

4729
02:56:36,910 --> 02:56:38,070
The head has fur.

4730
02:56:38,450 --> 02:56:40,230
That I can like grip on.

4731
02:56:41,230 --> 02:56:41,830
Come on.

4732
02:56:41,870 --> 02:56:42,470
Stab it.

4733
02:56:45,830 --> 02:56:46,850
Oh my god.

4734
02:56:46,870 --> 02:56:47,230
Come on.

4735
02:56:47,250 --> 02:56:47,510
Please.

4736
02:56:47,950 --> 02:56:50,690
This is for your own medical concern right here.

4737
02:56:54,150 --> 02:56:54,550
Alright.

4738
02:56:54,830 --> 02:56:55,790
Is he gonna slam?

4739
02:56:56,870 --> 02:56:57,910
Are you gonna slam now?

4740
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:00,530
What are you doing?

4741
02:57:01,210 --> 02:57:02,450
What the fuck are you doing?

4742
02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:03,010
Just slam.

4743
02:57:03,430 --> 02:57:04,170
What are you doing?

4744
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:04,670
Are you dancing?

4745
02:57:09,550 --> 02:57:09,950
Here?

4746
02:57:09,950 --> 02:57:10,690
He's gonna slam.

4747
02:57:10,730 --> 02:57:11,190
He's gonna do it.

4748
02:57:11,450 --> 02:57:12,010
Come on.

4749
02:57:13,870 --> 02:57:14,470
Come on!

4750
02:57:15,430 --> 02:57:16,350
Swing your hand!

4751
02:57:18,670 --> 02:57:21,030
Oh it's flexing.

4752
02:57:22,870 --> 02:57:24,470
Why are you shy?

4753
02:57:25,070 --> 02:57:25,750
Bro!

4754
02:57:25,930 --> 02:57:26,930
Just move!

4755
02:57:32,610 --> 02:57:35,270
What are you doing, bro?

4756
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:38,490
Oh my god.

4757
02:57:38,530 --> 02:57:39,650
I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

4758
02:57:42,090 --> 02:57:43,170
Just slam!

4759
02:57:44,730 --> 02:57:46,410
Don't be a little bitch.

4760
02:57:46,770 --> 02:57:47,490
Oh my god.

4761
02:57:48,910 --> 02:57:49,710
Are you gonna...

4762
02:57:53,090 --> 02:57:54,050
Oh my god.

4763
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:56,030
Bro, he's just standing there menacingly.

4764
02:57:56,050 --> 02:57:56,630
He's just wiggling.

4765
02:57:57,050 --> 02:57:58,390
There's nothing I can do.

4766
02:57:58,490 --> 02:57:59,490
He's just keep wiggling.

4767
02:58:01,410 --> 02:58:02,530
There you go.

4768
02:58:03,850 --> 02:58:06,910
I'll shoot you in the hand if you don't get over here right now.

4769
02:58:08,310 --> 02:58:08,790
I'll shoot you in the hand if you don't get over here right now.

4770
02:58:09,510 --> 02:58:10,830
Oh my god.

4771
02:58:10,870 --> 02:58:11,050
Oh my god.

4772
02:58:11,050 --> 02:58:13,970
Why the fuck did I like make him lose his axe?

4773
02:58:17,930 --> 02:58:18,950
Oh my god.

4774
02:58:18,950 --> 02:58:22,970
If I didn't make him lose his axe, this would have been so easy.

4775
02:58:23,510 --> 02:58:25,410
I just had to shoot his arm.

4776
02:58:25,890 --> 02:58:27,230
I just had to do that.

4777
02:58:31,940 --> 02:58:32,460
Come on.

4778
02:58:33,360 --> 02:58:33,940
Do it.

4779
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:34,480
Swing this.

4780
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:36,300
Swing this.

4781
02:58:36,460 --> 02:58:37,200
You know you want to.

4782
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:39,920
This is me.

4783
02:58:40,060 --> 02:58:40,540
Right here.

4784
02:58:40,700 --> 02:58:41,080
Come on.

4785
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:42,920
I'm like so out in the open.

4786
02:58:43,160 --> 02:58:44,280
So defenseless.

4787
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:46,120
Just do something.

4788
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:46,660
Anything.

4789
02:58:46,660 --> 02:58:48,740
Oh my god.

4790
02:58:48,740 --> 02:58:49,800
You're pissing me off.

4791
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:53,260
I'm going to give you hidden fees as well.

4792
02:58:57,160 --> 02:58:59,560
You're going to have hidden fees as well, man.

4793
02:59:01,100 --> 02:59:03,540
Okay, I'm going to go up the level on this side then.

4794
02:59:06,340 --> 02:59:08,160
At least stand on this panel.

4795
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:11,600
It's hidden fees time.

4796
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:15,120
Come on.

4797
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:15,700
Stand on it.

4798
02:59:15,740 --> 02:59:15,980
Nice.

4799
02:59:17,740 --> 02:59:18,820
Wait, wrong panel.

4800
02:59:19,300 --> 02:59:20,580
I can work with that.

4801
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:21,100
Actually.

4802
02:59:21,700 --> 02:59:22,780
Yeah, I can work with it.

4803
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:25,520
Alright, this way.

4804
02:59:26,260 --> 02:59:27,680
Alright, up another floor.

4805
02:59:30,300 --> 02:59:32,240
Can't see what's going on on my camera.

4806
02:59:32,320 --> 02:59:33,280
But I think I'm okay.

4807
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:36,320
Alright, here we go.

4808
02:59:37,300 --> 02:59:38,180
Now it's time.

4809
02:59:39,140 --> 02:59:41,360
It's time to do this again.

4810
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:42,820
Don't worry.

4811
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:44,200
We don't need the other side.

4812
02:59:44,200 --> 02:59:45,800
I can't believe it.

4813
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:46,680
Thank you for this.

4814
02:59:47,100 --> 02:59:48,300
Thank you.

4815
02:59:48,320 --> 02:59:49,000
Thank you.

4816
02:59:50,320 --> 02:59:52,360
He has performance anxiety.

4817
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:55,620
Here we go again.

4818
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:04,670
Alright.

4819
03:00:06,190 --> 03:00:07,070
This is it.

4820
03:00:07,290 --> 03:00:08,050
Right here we go.

4821
03:00:09,070 --> 03:00:12,860
I knew it would always work.

4822
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:14,680
I knew it.

4823
03:00:15,860 --> 03:00:17,340
I think it's this side, right?

4824
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:18,500
Which arm is it?

4825
03:00:20,860 --> 03:00:22,100
Guys, give me a sec.

4826
03:00:22,100 --> 03:00:24,120
I need to remember which arm it is.

4827
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:26,100
Guys, is it the left arm?

4828
03:00:26,200 --> 03:00:27,240
Or the right arm?

4829
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:28,020
Chat.

4830
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:31,220
Wait, can I actually grab the arm?

4831
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:32,980
Is it the right?

4832
03:00:33,020 --> 03:00:33,760
It's the right arm.

4833
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:34,040
Yeah?

4834
03:00:34,340 --> 03:00:35,540
The sword arm.

4835
03:00:35,720 --> 03:00:36,040
No!

4836
03:00:37,340 --> 03:00:37,940
No!

4837
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:43,710
No,

4838
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:53,300
please.

4839
03:00:55,100 --> 03:00:55,880
Let's go!

4840
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:58,440
Oh shit, here we go again.

4841
03:00:59,060 --> 03:01:00,480
Here we go again.

4842
03:01:06,760 --> 03:01:08,420
Oh, bait and hand swing?

4843
03:01:08,720 --> 03:01:09,980
Oh, is that it?

4844
03:01:10,420 --> 03:01:12,600
I go in the middle and then I bait?

4845
03:01:12,660 --> 03:01:13,360
Okay, here we go.

4846
03:01:13,540 --> 03:01:14,360
I got this.

4847
03:01:15,020 --> 03:01:15,940
Swing that arm.

4848
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:17,120
Swing it.

4849
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:18,920
Swing that...

4850
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:20,040
No, no, no, not the feet!

4851
03:01:23,300 --> 03:01:24,320
Swing that arm.

4852
03:01:24,540 --> 03:01:26,040
Come on, do it.

4853
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:29,380
Swing that fucking arm.

4854
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:34,300
Swing it.

4855
03:01:48,970 --> 03:01:49,750
Please just...

4856
03:01:49,770 --> 03:01:50,410
Just keep swinging.

4857
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:57,010
You know you want to.

4858
03:01:57,410 --> 03:01:59,250
Oh my god, he's swinging the arm.

4859
03:01:59,390 --> 03:02:01,070
Oh my god, he's doing it!

4860
03:02:01,430 --> 03:02:01,910
No!

4861
03:02:04,210 --> 03:02:05,410
It's okay, I figured it out.

4862
03:02:06,130 --> 03:02:06,610
Guys!

4863
03:02:10,060 --> 03:02:11,700
Let me hold the arm!

4864
03:02:16,040 --> 03:02:17,160
Oh my god, please.

4865
03:02:18,460 --> 03:02:19,420
Please, no.

4866
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:21,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4867
03:02:21,600 --> 03:02:23,060
No, no, no, don't get closer.

4868
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:27,620
Jesus Christ.

4869
03:02:27,780 --> 03:02:29,120
That window is like...

4870
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:30,240
The window to like...

4871
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:32,660
I got knocked a leg again.

4872
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,220
No, don't get closer.

4873
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:36,080
Please, for the love of god.

4874
03:02:36,420 --> 03:02:38,140
What if I hold this?

4875
03:02:38,220 --> 03:02:38,400
No!

4876
03:02:39,600 --> 03:02:40,200
Please!

4877
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:45,520
This is a medical emergency!

4878
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,160
What if you have cancer on the hand?

4879
03:02:48,520 --> 03:02:49,220
Let me see!

4880
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:52,220
Not medical profession, but professional.

4881
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:53,640
Just in case.

4882
03:02:54,360 --> 03:02:54,960
Just in case.

4883
03:02:57,260 --> 03:02:59,380
Not medical professional, but like...

4884
03:02:59,380 --> 03:03:00,740
I'm just trying to like help.

4885
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:03,620
Please.

4886
03:03:04,040 --> 03:03:04,540
Please!

4887
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:11,180
Your hand glowing is not a good sense!

4888
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:14,660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4889
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:15,180
No!

4890
03:03:15,260 --> 03:03:15,560
Please!

4891
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:16,420
Fuck yeah!

4892
03:03:20,100 --> 03:03:20,600
Please.

4893
03:03:21,780 --> 03:03:22,700
Please, please.

4894
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:26,220
Just let me stick my knife in the hand.

4895
03:03:26,960 --> 03:03:28,340
That's all I ask.

4896
03:03:28,340 --> 03:03:31,120
That's all I ask!

4897
03:03:33,720 --> 03:03:35,980
That's all I ask!

4898
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:38,220
That's all I ask!

4899
03:03:38,320 --> 03:03:38,380
That's all I ask!

4900
03:03:38,380 --> 03:03:38,500
That's all I ask!

4901
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:40,320
I just wanna stick my...

4902
03:03:40,320 --> 03:03:42,640
knife into your hand.

4903
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:44,100
No!

4904
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:45,140
No!

4905
03:03:48,900 --> 03:03:49,860
Please!

4906
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:50,300
Please!

4907
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:53,480
It's just one stab!

4908
03:03:55,060 --> 03:03:57,180
Oh my god!

4909
03:03:57,320 --> 03:03:58,320
It's like...

4910
03:03:58,340 --> 03:03:59,820
Literally one stab!

4911
03:04:03,360 --> 03:04:04,000
Okay.

4912
03:04:05,020 --> 03:04:06,420
He's baiting me.

4913
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:07,360
He's baiting me.

4914
03:04:07,360 --> 03:04:08,120
He's fucking baiting me.

4915
03:04:08,300 --> 03:04:08,580
Bro!

4916
03:04:09,080 --> 03:04:10,300
You fuck!

4917
03:04:11,480 --> 03:04:12,120
Bro!

4918
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:17,920
He's actually baiting me so hard right now.

4919
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:21,280
He's trolling me.

4920
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:23,020
He's trolling me right now.

4921
03:04:23,220 --> 03:04:24,660
He actually is.

4922
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:26,580
Give me your arm!

4923
03:04:26,740 --> 03:04:28,240
Give me your fucking arm!

4924
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:28,320
Give me your fucking arm!

4925
03:04:28,340 --> 03:04:28,840
Oh!

4926
03:04:28,940 --> 03:04:29,480
Wait!

4927
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:31,980
You can walk past that?

4928
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:37,580
You can walk past that?

4929
03:04:47,220 --> 03:04:49,940
He walked over it...

4930
03:04:52,400 --> 03:04:54,240
I can't believe it.

4931
03:04:56,160 --> 03:04:57,480
I'm so sad.

4932
03:04:57,860 --> 03:04:59,360
I've been stuck in this room.

4933
03:04:59,360 --> 03:05:02,360
I can never get him to let me check his hand.

4934
03:05:02,660 --> 03:05:04,800
He won't let me check his hand.

4935
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:05,980
I don't understand.

4936
03:05:09,220 --> 03:05:10,420
I'm so sad.

4937
03:05:15,070 --> 03:05:15,670
Please.

4938
03:05:16,350 --> 03:05:18,090
All I ask...

4939
03:05:18,090 --> 03:05:19,510
Just let me...

4940
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:21,850
Let me grab the hand.

4941
03:05:24,090 --> 03:05:24,690
Please.

4942
03:05:25,410 --> 03:05:26,930
It'll be so fast.

4943
03:05:27,070 --> 03:05:28,150
It's just a little pause.

4944
03:05:28,290 --> 03:05:28,910
Not the feet.

4945
03:05:30,230 --> 03:05:31,210
Not the feet!

4946
03:05:31,290 --> 03:05:32,210
I meant the hand!

4947
03:05:32,390 --> 03:05:33,750
Get that shit away from me!

4948
03:05:33,850 --> 03:05:34,270
Get away!

4949
03:05:34,710 --> 03:05:35,410
Be gone!

4950
03:05:40,150 --> 03:05:41,670
Oh my god.

4951
03:05:41,750 --> 03:05:43,070
Not the other foot.

4952
03:05:43,170 --> 03:05:44,490
Not the other foot!

4953
03:05:44,590 --> 03:05:46,770
I didn't mean give me the other one.

4954
03:05:50,010 --> 03:05:50,930
Sir, please.

4955
03:05:51,970 --> 03:05:53,010
Am I far enough?

4956
03:05:53,130 --> 03:05:53,910
I should be far enough.

4957
03:05:54,050 --> 03:05:54,910
Oh my god.

4958
03:05:56,190 --> 03:05:58,010
Sir, I told you.

4959
03:05:58,070 --> 03:05:58,890
Get that shit away from me!

4960
03:05:58,910 --> 03:06:00,510
It's not the feet.

4961
03:06:00,670 --> 03:06:01,810
It's the hand!

4962
03:06:05,050 --> 03:06:05,610
Alright.

4963
03:06:05,750 --> 03:06:06,350
This time.

4964
03:06:07,170 --> 03:06:11,470
This is the longest fight we've ever had just because he wouldn't give me the hand.

4965
03:06:11,950 --> 03:06:13,650
I swear to god.

4966
03:06:15,510 --> 03:06:16,690
Oh my god.

4967
03:06:17,210 --> 03:06:17,770
Please.

4968
03:06:17,950 --> 03:06:18,210
Please.

4969
03:06:18,230 --> 03:06:18,390
Please.

4970
03:06:18,390 --> 03:06:18,670
Please.

4971
03:06:18,670 --> 03:06:18,830
Please.

4972
03:06:21,910 --> 03:06:22,470
Yes!

4973
03:06:25,870 --> 03:06:27,850
He actually held his air!

4974
03:06:28,070 --> 03:06:29,430
Oh my god!

4975
03:06:29,430 --> 03:06:30,370
I'm holding the hand!

4976
03:06:31,830 --> 03:06:33,030
Don't worry!

4977
03:06:33,130 --> 03:06:35,550
It's just a benign pimple!

4978
03:06:36,150 --> 03:06:37,110
Don't worry!

4979
03:06:40,530 --> 03:06:42,070
It's just benign!

4980
03:06:42,770 --> 03:06:46,230
I'm pumping really quick with my sharp sword!

4981
03:06:46,550 --> 03:06:49,990
I'm burning so there's no bacteria on the sword!

4982
03:06:51,010 --> 03:06:52,650
Oh my god.

4983
03:06:56,410 --> 03:06:56,810
Bro.

4984
03:06:56,810 --> 03:06:59,550
This was the worst customer I've ever had.

4985
03:07:03,620 --> 03:07:04,960
I cured him.

4986
03:07:05,280 --> 03:07:05,820
Done.

4987
03:07:06,940 --> 03:07:08,020
Oh my god.

4988
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:09,640
I'm blacklisting this customer.

4989
03:07:10,080 --> 03:07:11,120
Holy shit.

4990
03:07:14,780 --> 03:07:16,980
Good job holding his hand!

4991
03:07:17,520 --> 03:07:19,340
Wes, thank you for the super chat!

4992
03:07:19,480 --> 03:07:19,940
Thank you!

4993
03:07:20,020 --> 03:07:20,680
Thank you!

4994
03:07:22,060 --> 03:07:25,800
This was worse than the bird who was trying to find the girlfriend.

4995
03:07:26,760 --> 03:07:29,160
We literally needed to just hold his hand.

4996
03:07:29,360 --> 03:07:30,740
And this fucker was too shy.

4997
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:32,220
He was too scared.

4998
03:07:38,370 --> 03:07:39,870
Another happy customer.

4999
03:07:40,830 --> 03:07:41,770
Never return.

5000
03:07:42,810 --> 03:07:45,010
I'm closing my doors for this customer.

5001
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:49,080
Yay!

5002
03:07:54,900 --> 03:07:56,900
Two people in the black.

5003
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:59,160
I was like, this is one of the easiest ones.

5004
03:07:59,320 --> 03:08:00,640
And I swear to fucking god.

5005
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:01,720
I'm holding.

5006
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,820
I swear my god was bugged out or some shit.

5007
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:12,920
There's no fucking way.

5008
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:15,280
He had to be bugged out.

5009
03:08:15,420 --> 03:08:17,000
Because it took me so long.

5010
03:08:21,100 --> 03:08:22,900
Oh, it's nearly over!

5011
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:26,420
I'm about to complete the ritual to have my girlfriend back!

5012
03:08:27,160 --> 03:08:27,680
Guys!

5013
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:29,200
Guys!

5014
03:08:29,780 --> 03:08:31,300
I'm gonna make it!

5015
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:35,820
He stands in the way.

5016
03:08:36,540 --> 03:08:37,660
What is that?

5017
03:08:39,740 --> 03:08:42,100
You are a quick one.

5018
03:08:42,920 --> 03:08:45,360
I am not a quick one.

5019
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:50,380
Who the fuck is that?

5020
03:08:52,300 --> 03:08:53,700
Alright, time to pray.

5021
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,320
Oh, Arlo.

5022
03:08:57,820 --> 03:08:59,320
Oh my god, Arlo.

5023
03:08:59,460 --> 03:09:00,840
That guy fucking sucked.

5024
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:04,520
I hope he never calls back and asks me to fix his problems again.

5025
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:05,920
Bro.

5026
03:09:06,480 --> 03:09:08,840
Oh my god, this guy is forever banned.

5027
03:09:09,080 --> 03:09:09,900
Banned from ever.

5028
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:11,480
I'm gonna fucking block his number.

5029
03:09:12,020 --> 03:09:14,600
He's never... I don't care how much he pays, man.

5030
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:16,080
That guy fucking sucked.

5031
03:09:20,140 --> 03:09:22,960
That guy fucking was terrible, man.

5032
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:25,580
He wouldn't fucking... He kept giving me his feet.

5033
03:09:25,720 --> 03:09:26,580
I was like, bro.

5034
03:09:26,820 --> 03:09:27,520
I was like, sir?

5035
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:28,320
Sir?

5036
03:09:28,640 --> 03:09:30,420
I'm not a feet doctor, sir.

5037
03:09:32,060 --> 03:09:34,940
Sir, I need the hand, not the feet.

5038
03:09:38,840 --> 03:09:39,820
It was terrible.

5039
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:41,380
He wouldn't fucking stop.

5040
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:45,180
Even if he paid a billion.

5041
03:09:47,660 --> 03:09:48,900
You see that, right?

5042
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:49,380
It was like...

5043
03:09:50,560 --> 03:09:51,700
Messages that like...

5044
03:09:51,700 --> 03:09:53,820
People who do like OnlyFans.

5045
03:09:53,960 --> 03:09:55,120
And then like they get like...

5046
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:56,040
They like post like...

5047
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,940
The types of tweets and DMs...

5048
03:09:57,940 --> 03:10:00,060
The type of DMs they get in private messages.

5049
03:10:00,520 --> 03:10:02,440
They'll be like, I'll give you like...

5050
03:10:03,960 --> 03:10:08,620
I'll give you one million dollars if you give me an exclusive picture.

5051
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:12,120
Exclusive picture of feet.

5052
03:10:14,060 --> 03:10:14,680
There's like...

5053
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:16,220
I've seen like Twitter message...

5054
03:10:16,220 --> 03:10:18,000
Like Twitter post back then.

5055
03:10:18,280 --> 03:10:19,440
Of like girls.

5056
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:20,180
Like girl...

5057
03:10:20,180 --> 03:10:22,820
Like they don't even do any of those like OnlyFans stuff.

5058
03:10:22,880 --> 03:10:23,480
They just like...

5059
03:10:23,480 --> 03:10:25,960
They just post on like Twitter like pictures of themselves.

5060
03:10:26,300 --> 03:10:28,840
And they will get like private DMs and stuff.

5061
03:10:28,920 --> 03:10:30,360
And being like, ma'am.

5062
03:10:30,420 --> 03:10:32,100
I know like you don't offer any of these.

5063
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:36,600
But like what if like I give you like a hundred thousand dollars for just one picture, ma'am.

5064
03:10:36,680 --> 03:10:37,140
Just one...

5065
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:38,300
One picture.

5066
03:10:38,300 --> 03:10:38,600
I'm like, what?

5067
03:10:38,600 --> 03:10:39,360
What the fuck?

5068
03:10:40,220 --> 03:10:42,000
And I was like, holy shit.

5069
03:10:42,400 --> 03:10:45,080
And they're just like, guys, you know, a million's a million.

5070
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:49,780
Like to the left.

5071
03:10:49,820 --> 03:10:50,280
Not here.

5072
03:10:52,420 --> 03:10:53,780
Like just regular...

5073
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:54,840
Regular like...

5074
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:55,800
Not just women.

5075
03:10:55,940 --> 03:10:58,140
But like regular guys who are just...

5076
03:10:58,140 --> 03:10:59,160
Regular like...

5077
03:10:59,160 --> 03:11:02,460
Like women and men who are just like good looking.

5078
03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:05,800
They get like random DMs and stuff like that.

5079
03:11:05,960 --> 03:11:06,740
And I'm like, whoa.

5080
03:11:07,140 --> 03:11:07,900
Oh, my God.

5081
03:11:08,740 --> 03:11:09,300
Where did they get these?

5082
03:11:09,380 --> 03:11:10,300
Saudi prince.

5083
03:11:10,840 --> 03:11:11,400
True.

5084
03:11:15,020 --> 03:11:15,580
Yeah.

5085
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:17,000
It's real oiler.

5086
03:11:19,160 --> 03:11:19,720
Alright.

5087
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:20,220
Wrong.

5088
03:11:20,500 --> 03:11:21,440
Wrong entrance.

5089
03:11:21,560 --> 03:11:22,200
Where do I go?

5090
03:11:23,100 --> 03:11:24,220
There's nowhere here.

5091
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:25,740
Should I go to the right?

5092
03:11:26,820 --> 03:11:28,680
I mean for a million.

5093
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:31,260
Do I go to the right or the left?

5094
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:34,060
Where is...

5095
03:11:34,060 --> 03:11:35,700
I want 100k.

5096
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:41,820
Is it right side?

5097
03:11:43,160 --> 03:11:43,940
Check the map.

5098
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:44,720
Which way is self?

5099
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:47,480
Self is down.

5100
03:11:49,080 --> 03:11:50,180
Self is down!

5101
03:11:51,160 --> 03:11:52,840
Okay, self is this way.

5102
03:11:53,740 --> 03:11:54,240
Okay.

5103
03:11:55,080 --> 03:11:55,580
Alright.

5104
03:11:55,720 --> 03:11:56,840
Oh, you mean like...

5105
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:58,420
Is it that one to the right?

5106
03:11:59,060 --> 03:11:59,980
Is it this one?

5107
03:12:03,700 --> 03:12:04,520
Is it...

5108
03:12:04,520 --> 03:12:07,260
That entrance over there to the far right?

5109
03:12:07,260 --> 03:12:08,440
Wait, how do I zoom in?

5110
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:09,400
Is it like here?

5111
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:11,400
Wait...

5112
03:12:12,100 --> 03:12:13,240
Like over here.

5113
03:12:13,860 --> 03:12:17,240
You see where I'm... Okay, you guys might not know where I'm looking at, but...

5114
03:12:18,700 --> 03:12:19,540
That little hole?

5115
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:22,280
Right there?

5116
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:24,920
That little hole over there?

5117
03:12:26,060 --> 03:12:26,660
Right here?

5118
03:12:28,980 --> 03:12:30,000
Like right here?

5119
03:12:32,040 --> 03:12:32,680
Right here?

5120
03:12:32,760 --> 03:12:33,860
I don't know if you guys can see it.

5121
03:12:37,260 --> 03:12:37,460
This hole.

5122
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:40,240
This has to be the hole, right?

5123
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:41,840
I'ma look at the right one.

5124
03:12:46,040 --> 03:12:47,060
Alright, right here.

5125
03:12:48,180 --> 03:12:48,660
Alright.

5126
03:12:50,140 --> 03:12:51,780
Arlo, where the fuck are you going?

5127
03:12:53,740 --> 03:12:55,240
Okay, just follow this.

5128
03:12:57,780 --> 03:12:58,440
Don't worry.

5129
03:12:58,900 --> 03:13:01,080
I have autopilot on for Arlo.

5130
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:04,800
Thank God for autopilot, Arlo.

5131
03:13:05,340 --> 03:13:06,400
All the way down.

5132
03:13:06,660 --> 03:13:08,120
All the way down.

5133
03:13:09,180 --> 03:13:10,960
So like all the way down there?

5134
03:13:11,160 --> 03:13:12,740
At the very edge of the map?

5135
03:13:16,020 --> 03:13:16,480
Uhhh...

5136
03:13:16,480 --> 03:13:17,560
I guess I'll go this way.

5137
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:19,740
Actually...

5138
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:21,700
Does it matter which way I go?

5139
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:22,900
I'll go this way actually.

5140
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:24,020
Yeah.

5141
03:13:26,720 --> 03:13:27,180
Okay.

5142
03:13:27,400 --> 03:13:29,520
All the way down, Arlo.

5143
03:13:29,640 --> 03:13:30,620
This is gonna be a long ride.

5144
03:13:31,900 --> 03:13:33,400
We're at the finish line, Arlo.

5145
03:13:33,800 --> 03:13:37,300
You know, I can't wait after I finish this game to play Hello Kitty Adventure.

5146
03:13:39,920 --> 03:13:42,260
One of the best games ever made.

5147
03:13:42,420 --> 03:13:47,140
I never played it before, but I expected to be one of the best.

5148
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:51,420
Alright, let me just go straight down.

5149
03:13:52,140 --> 03:13:52,820
Yeah!

5150
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,320
Hell yeah!

5151
03:13:56,360 --> 03:13:57,820
Bring on Hello Kitty!

5152
03:13:58,380 --> 03:13:59,600
Hello Kitty!

5153
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:03,880
The critically acclaimed sequel.

5154
03:14:04,260 --> 03:14:05,380
Sequel of what?

5155
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:06,440
Like...

5156
03:14:07,240 --> 03:14:08,080
There's a...

5157
03:14:08,080 --> 03:14:09,340
There's a first one?

5158
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:11,900
But I've never heard of it.

5159
03:14:12,420 --> 03:14:14,540
Okay, it has to be the cloud all the way down here.

5160
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:16,660
Use the sword?

5161
03:14:16,840 --> 03:14:17,860
I mean, I don't need to know...

5162
03:14:17,860 --> 03:14:20,160
Use the sword if I know it's like down...

5163
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:21,260
There's no way...

5164
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:23,380
Go back up!

5165
03:14:23,460 --> 03:14:24,100
Go back up!

5166
03:14:30,500 --> 03:14:32,260
Okay, I need to figure out how to get down.

5167
03:14:32,800 --> 03:14:33,200
Okay.

5168
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:34,240
Give me a sec.

5169
03:14:34,780 --> 03:14:35,260
I need...

5170
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:38,200
Holy...

5171
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:39,880
Thank God, the edge.

5172
03:14:40,240 --> 03:14:41,120
My life.

5173
03:14:42,200 --> 03:14:42,600
Okay.

5174
03:14:42,600 --> 03:14:43,420
Alright.

5175
03:14:43,800 --> 03:14:45,040
Okay, that was...

5176
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:46,280
That was a little risky.

5177
03:14:46,540 --> 03:14:48,200
Guys, that was just...

5178
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:50,080
Just a little risky!

5179
03:14:50,620 --> 03:14:52,020
Just a little bit!

5180
03:14:52,960 --> 03:14:56,500
Whoa, I stopped myself before anybody got hurt.

5181
03:14:59,260 --> 03:14:59,940
Whoa.

5182
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:02,020
That was...

5183
03:15:02,020 --> 03:15:02,360
Whoa.

5184
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:05,200
That was a little wild of me to do.

5185
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:06,440
It's a...

5186
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:07,800
Just a little wild.

5187
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:14,620
Oh, now you jump off cliffs, Arlo.

5188
03:15:15,620 --> 03:15:16,060
Okay.

5189
03:15:17,240 --> 03:15:18,200
Like this way.

5190
03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:21,640
It has to be like in between those two cliffs, right?

5191
03:15:22,240 --> 03:15:23,220
It has to be.

5192
03:15:26,600 --> 03:15:27,300
Here we go.

5193
03:15:28,980 --> 03:15:30,240
Where else could it be?

5194
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:31,440
Come on, Arlo.

5195
03:15:31,500 --> 03:15:31,980
You can do it.

5196
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:32,600
Come on.

5197
03:15:33,120 --> 03:15:34,100
Arlo, come on.

5198
03:15:34,100 --> 03:15:35,140
Don't be a little pussy!

5199
03:15:35,580 --> 03:15:36,020
Come on.

5200
03:15:37,340 --> 03:15:37,780
Come on.

5201
03:15:38,400 --> 03:15:38,860
Come on.

5202
03:15:38,860 --> 03:15:40,900
Eventually, Arlo will drop down with me, right?

5203
03:15:41,240 --> 03:15:41,700
Arlo!

5204
03:15:41,720 --> 03:15:42,640
Hello, Arlo.

5205
03:15:42,820 --> 03:15:43,280
Arlo!

5206
03:15:43,580 --> 03:15:44,120
Come on.

5207
03:15:45,640 --> 03:15:46,580
Arlo, come on!

5208
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:49,520
You're gonna teleport right behind me anytime now.

5209
03:15:50,520 --> 03:15:50,980
Anytime.

5210
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:54,380
Arlo, are you teleporting?

5211
03:15:54,500 --> 03:15:54,960
Arlo?

5212
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:58,500
Arlo, you're gonna teleport, right?

5213
03:16:01,920 --> 03:16:02,380
Arlo?

5214
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:04,360
Arlo.

5215
03:16:04,480 --> 03:16:05,560
Oh, he's going the long way.

5216
03:16:06,180 --> 03:16:06,880
Oh, my god.

5217
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:07,380
I'm glad he's smart.

5218
03:16:08,060 --> 03:16:09,660
He actually went the long way.

5219
03:16:12,260 --> 03:16:13,340
No, he doesn't quit!

5220
03:16:13,480 --> 03:16:13,900
Look, see?

5221
03:16:14,240 --> 03:16:15,120
Look at him!

5222
03:16:15,140 --> 03:16:15,940
What a good horse!

5223
03:16:17,960 --> 03:16:18,860
Oh my god!

5224
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:20,500
I made it!

5225
03:16:20,600 --> 03:16:21,400
I hit the jump!

5226
03:16:22,260 --> 03:16:24,160
I'm a professional horse driver.

5227
03:16:25,780 --> 03:16:27,060
Alright, this way.

5228
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:29,700
This way, here I go!

5229
03:16:30,220 --> 03:16:30,700
Yay!

5230
03:16:33,400 --> 03:16:34,760
It has to be this.

5231
03:16:36,540 --> 03:16:36,980
Yay!

5232
03:16:36,980 --> 03:16:38,860
Okay, and then I raise my sword.

5233
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:40,660
And then I hit it.

5234
03:16:49,550 --> 03:16:49,990
Yeah!

5235
03:16:50,950 --> 03:16:52,050
I did it!

5236
03:16:52,170 --> 03:16:52,610
Yippee!

5237
03:16:54,390 --> 03:16:55,730
Arlo, get over here.

5238
03:16:57,550 --> 03:16:58,770
Arlo, get over here.

5239
03:16:59,030 --> 03:16:59,470
Arlo, get over here.

5240
03:17:01,350 --> 03:17:03,450
I need to keep my five stars, Arlo.

5241
03:17:05,510 --> 03:17:07,030
Okay, okay, no, no, no.

5242
03:17:07,270 --> 03:17:08,410
I'm right here, Arlo.

5243
03:17:08,570 --> 03:17:09,490
I'm right here, Arlo.

5244
03:17:09,950 --> 03:17:10,810
No, no, no.

5245
03:17:10,870 --> 03:17:11,190
I'm right here, Arlo.

5246
03:17:11,190 --> 03:17:11,190
I'm right here, Arlo.

5247
03:17:11,210 --> 03:17:12,270
Right here.

5248
03:17:12,670 --> 03:17:14,110
What the fuck?

5249
03:17:15,230 --> 03:17:16,770
Is it... Do I go up here?

5250
03:17:18,550 --> 03:17:20,010
Wait, where do I go?

5251
03:17:20,290 --> 03:17:21,750
Where the fuck is the...

5252
03:17:22,450 --> 03:17:23,030
Here?

5253
03:17:24,980 --> 03:17:25,270
Arlo?

5254
03:17:28,290 --> 03:17:29,150
Right here?

5255
03:17:30,390 --> 03:17:30,970
Oh!

5256
03:17:31,970 --> 03:17:32,550
Sorry.

5257
03:17:34,730 --> 03:17:35,310
Yeah!

5258
03:17:37,830 --> 03:17:38,870
Use Arlo?

5259
03:17:39,030 --> 03:17:40,430
I don't need to use Arlo.

5260
03:17:42,670 --> 03:17:43,490
Is it here?

5261
03:17:43,890 --> 03:17:44,470
Is it here?

5262
03:17:44,830 --> 03:17:46,210
Oh no, where's the sun?

5263
03:17:49,330 --> 03:17:50,650
Where did the sun go?

5264
03:17:53,390 --> 03:17:54,710
Wait, I do need Arlo?

5265
03:17:54,910 --> 03:17:56,350
Arlo, apparently I need you.

5266
03:17:57,150 --> 03:17:58,130
Wait, is that a shrine?

5267
03:17:58,410 --> 03:17:58,930
Oh shit!

5268
03:17:59,050 --> 03:18:00,190
Okay, guys, give me a sec.

5269
03:18:00,270 --> 03:18:01,010
I need to go to the shrine.

5270
03:18:03,530 --> 03:18:05,230
Guys, I need to go to the shrine.

5271
03:18:08,750 --> 03:18:10,050
Arlo can jump across?

5272
03:18:10,230 --> 03:18:10,930
He can?

5273
03:18:11,790 --> 03:18:12,710
There's no way.

5274
03:18:13,410 --> 03:18:14,870
There's no fucking way.

5275
03:18:17,790 --> 03:18:19,010
We need to pray first.

5276
03:18:19,090 --> 03:18:19,710
Give me a sec.

5277
03:18:20,030 --> 03:18:20,450
Pray!

5278
03:18:21,710 --> 03:18:22,130
Pray?

5279
03:18:23,550 --> 03:18:23,970
Pray.

5280
03:18:23,970 --> 03:18:25,870
Oh my god, now you don't believe in God anymore?

5281
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:27,590
Pray!

5282
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:27,750
Pray!

5283
03:18:28,350 --> 03:18:28,590
Okay.

5284
03:18:30,010 --> 03:18:30,710
This is it.

5285
03:18:32,650 --> 03:18:34,030
We need to find the lizard.

5286
03:18:34,970 --> 03:18:35,390
We need to find the lizard.

5287
03:18:35,390 --> 03:18:37,370
I hear him, but like, where is...

5288
03:18:37,370 --> 03:18:37,870
Oh, there he is.

5289
03:18:39,190 --> 03:18:40,530
He's like hiding up here.

5290
03:18:44,310 --> 03:18:45,870
I got the tail!

5291
03:18:46,030 --> 03:18:46,870
Did you guys see that?

5292
03:18:47,510 --> 03:18:49,410
I specifically hit the tail!

5293
03:18:50,290 --> 03:18:52,010
Okay, now I need to figure out how to climb this.

5294
03:18:52,810 --> 03:18:53,690
Oh my god.

5295
03:18:56,910 --> 03:18:57,550
There we go.

5296
03:18:58,330 --> 03:19:00,050
I don't like how there's no sun.

5297
03:19:00,270 --> 03:19:01,550
Doesn't make me... fuck.

5298
03:19:02,390 --> 03:19:02,830
Okay.

5299
03:19:03,170 --> 03:19:04,210
I don't like that.

5300
03:19:04,210 --> 03:19:06,690
No, are you fucking kidding me?

5301
03:19:07,310 --> 03:19:07,950
Alright.

5302
03:19:08,050 --> 03:19:08,410
Jump.

5303
03:19:08,930 --> 03:19:09,570
Jump.

5304
03:19:10,350 --> 03:19:10,990
Alright.

5305
03:19:11,270 --> 03:19:11,970
Here we go.

5306
03:19:13,530 --> 03:19:14,170
Boop.

5307
03:19:14,790 --> 03:19:15,430
Yay!

5308
03:19:17,190 --> 03:19:17,830
Alright.

5309
03:19:19,930 --> 03:19:20,610
I know, please.

5310
03:19:20,750 --> 03:19:21,850
Apparently I need you.

5311
03:19:24,110 --> 03:19:25,870
Apparently they said I need you.

5312
03:19:27,050 --> 03:19:28,310
Oh god.

5313
03:19:28,390 --> 03:19:28,830
No.

5314
03:19:29,150 --> 03:19:30,970
I'm gonna drive this horse.

5315
03:19:32,450 --> 03:19:33,090
Please.

5316
03:19:34,210 --> 03:19:34,910
Please.

5317
03:19:36,090 --> 03:19:37,490
Barlow, please.

5318
03:19:39,150 --> 03:19:40,050
There we go.

5319
03:19:40,710 --> 03:19:41,430
Nice.

5320
03:19:43,070 --> 03:19:44,450
Okay, and then...

5321
03:19:44,450 --> 03:19:46,470
Up we go.

5322
03:19:47,990 --> 03:19:48,710
Oh.

5323
03:19:50,350 --> 03:19:51,510
Here we go.

5324
03:19:52,170 --> 03:19:53,530
And then...

5325
03:19:54,430 --> 03:19:56,010
This is where we do it.

5326
03:19:57,870 --> 03:19:59,530
Make the jump, Barlow.

5327
03:20:00,210 --> 03:20:01,350
I believe.

5328
03:20:01,430 --> 03:20:02,150
I believe.

5329
03:20:03,050 --> 03:20:03,770
I believe.

5330
03:20:04,890 --> 03:20:05,770
It's time.

5331
03:20:07,790 --> 03:20:08,970
Can you make this jump?

5332
03:20:09,590 --> 03:20:10,630
We need hands!

5333
03:20:37,300 --> 03:20:37,780
No!

5334
03:20:38,700 --> 03:20:39,420
It's okay.

5335
03:20:39,860 --> 03:20:41,140
Guys, Arlo can swim.

5336
03:20:41,280 --> 03:20:41,900
Right, guys?

5337
03:20:43,300 --> 03:20:43,780
Guys.

5338
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:46,060
Guys, Arlo can...

5339
03:20:46,060 --> 03:20:46,480
Wait, guys.

5340
03:20:46,500 --> 03:20:47,160
Let me look at my screen.

5341
03:20:47,400 --> 03:20:48,380
No, Arlo!

5342
03:20:50,280 --> 03:20:52,160
Guys, I have empathy.

5343
03:20:52,300 --> 03:20:53,060
I swear to god.

5344
03:20:53,060 --> 03:20:54,280
I swear to god.

5345
03:20:54,480 --> 03:20:56,540
We all know horses can swim!

5346
03:20:57,020 --> 03:20:57,620
They're fine!

5347
03:20:58,800 --> 03:20:59,940
They can swim!

5348
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:03,140
We all know they can swim, guys!

5349
03:21:05,360 --> 03:21:06,440
Horses can swim!

5350
03:21:06,740 --> 03:21:08,820
If I can swim, so can Arlo!

5351
03:21:10,960 --> 03:21:11,520
Why?

5352
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:14,260
Guys.

5353
03:21:14,400 --> 03:21:16,720
If I can swim, so can Arlo, guys.

5354
03:21:16,860 --> 03:21:17,620
We all know this.

5355
03:21:18,160 --> 03:21:19,860
We all know this, guys.

5356
03:21:20,820 --> 03:21:22,540
Like, we all know this.

5357
03:21:23,220 --> 03:21:24,740
Am I going the right way?

5358
03:21:24,900 --> 03:21:26,140
I can never tell.

5359
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:28,980
I assume it's this way.

5360
03:21:33,430 --> 03:21:34,590
I assume.

5361
03:21:36,130 --> 03:21:37,830
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

5362
03:21:37,850 --> 03:21:38,410
He don't...

5363
03:21:38,410 --> 03:21:39,290
What do you mean?

5364
03:21:39,370 --> 03:21:41,310
I didn't wanna bring Arlo!

5365
03:21:41,590 --> 03:21:43,930
I wasn't gonna bring him along!

5366
03:21:44,170 --> 03:21:45,690
You guys forced me.

5367
03:21:45,750 --> 03:21:47,210
I was gonna protect Arlo.

5368
03:21:47,990 --> 03:21:50,090
I wanted to protect him!

5369
03:21:50,690 --> 03:21:51,450
D-Dragon.

5370
03:21:51,530 --> 03:21:53,770
Thank you, Super Chat.

5371
03:21:53,850 --> 03:21:54,130
Thank you.

5372
03:21:54,150 --> 03:21:54,690
Thank you.

5373
03:21:56,270 --> 03:21:57,790
Guys, that's fucked up, guys.

5374
03:21:58,070 --> 03:21:59,190
You guys did that.

5375
03:21:59,370 --> 03:22:00,830
I was gonna bring him along.

5376
03:22:00,970 --> 03:22:02,210
I wasn't gonna bring him along.

5377
03:22:04,050 --> 03:22:04,490
No.

5378
03:22:04,590 --> 03:22:06,090
You killed Arlo.

5379
03:22:06,210 --> 03:22:06,830
Not me.

5380
03:22:08,370 --> 03:22:08,990
It's okay.

5381
03:22:09,050 --> 03:22:09,970
Horses don't take fall...

5382
03:22:09,970 --> 03:22:10,130
Yeah!

5383
03:22:10,170 --> 03:22:11,110
Horses don't take fall damage.

5384
03:22:11,190 --> 03:22:11,650
Right, Frozen?

5385
03:22:11,950 --> 03:22:12,770
Thank you, Super Chat.

5386
03:22:12,870 --> 03:22:13,090
Thank you.

5387
03:22:13,150 --> 03:22:13,610
Thank you.

5388
03:22:13,990 --> 03:22:15,990
Guys, horses don't take fall damage, guys.

5389
03:22:16,750 --> 03:22:18,170
That's what Minecraft taught me.

5390
03:22:18,570 --> 03:22:20,410
Wait, actually... No, wait.

5391
03:22:20,470 --> 03:22:21,670
Horses can die from fall damage.

5392
03:22:21,930 --> 03:22:23,210
Guys, this isn't like...

5393
03:22:23,210 --> 03:22:25,130
This is like Arlo Minecraft.

5394
03:22:26,830 --> 03:22:27,350
Guys.

5395
03:22:29,710 --> 03:22:30,350
It's okay.

5396
03:22:30,470 --> 03:22:31,270
He had water.

5397
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:31,850
No!

5398
03:22:32,010 --> 03:22:33,790
They don't take fall damage if there's water!

5399
03:22:36,650 --> 03:22:38,010
They don't take like...

5400
03:22:38,010 --> 03:22:39,270
They don't take fall damage!

5401
03:22:39,590 --> 03:22:40,210
They don't take like...

5402
03:22:40,210 --> 03:22:40,870
If there's water!

5403
03:22:41,150 --> 03:22:41,530
Chat.

5404
03:22:42,690 --> 03:22:45,210
Wait, I wasn't supposed to... This is just an easter egg.

5405
03:22:47,550 --> 03:22:49,810
I guess I'll grab the easter egg.

5406
03:22:51,090 --> 03:22:52,130
I guess I'll grab the easter egg.

5407
03:22:52,130 --> 03:22:52,930
Since I'm here.

5408
03:22:54,250 --> 03:22:56,230
I guess I'll just grab this.

5409
03:22:57,550 --> 03:22:58,690
I guess I'll just grab this.

5410
03:22:59,250 --> 03:23:00,290
I gotta recharge.

5411
03:23:02,690 --> 03:23:03,870
Where do I go then?

5412
03:23:04,490 --> 03:23:05,050
Huh?

5413
03:23:06,130 --> 03:23:08,150
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

5414
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:13,320
No!

5415
03:23:13,540 --> 03:23:14,100
No!

5416
03:23:14,540 --> 03:23:15,320
I'm okay.

5417
03:23:15,500 --> 03:23:17,000
I ate so much fruit.

5418
03:23:19,300 --> 03:23:20,500
I'm gonna see to the right.

5419
03:23:22,860 --> 03:23:25,540
Guys, do you guys know if you hold it, you jump further away?

5420
03:23:27,340 --> 03:23:29,920
You jump further away?

5421
03:23:30,280 --> 03:23:34,360
I wonder how long have people been yelling at me to hold my axe.

5422
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:36,520
I wonder how long have people been yelling at me to hold my axe.

5423
03:23:36,760 --> 03:23:37,320
Guys!

5424
03:23:37,960 --> 03:23:38,520
Guys!

5425
03:23:38,540 --> 03:23:40,820
Did you guys... I just found out guys!

5426
03:23:42,360 --> 03:23:42,920
Guys!

5427
03:23:42,940 --> 03:23:43,160
Guys!

5428
03:23:43,160 --> 03:23:44,020
Oh my god!

5429
03:23:44,300 --> 03:23:49,500
I just found out that if you hold down, you can jump further.

5430
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:50,020
I just found out that if you hold down, you can jump further.

5431
03:23:50,020 --> 03:23:50,900
Shit.

5432
03:23:53,380 --> 03:23:55,740
Makes me wonder how long people...

5433
03:23:55,740 --> 03:23:56,520
Uh...

5434
03:23:58,040 --> 03:24:00,520
How long people have yelled at me.

5435
03:24:00,820 --> 03:24:01,380
Really?

5436
03:24:01,500 --> 03:24:02,460
Makes you wonder?

5437
03:24:05,320 --> 03:24:06,900
Where do I go though?

5438
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:09,540
Was it not this way?

5439
03:24:15,760 --> 03:24:16,300
Oh wait.

5440
03:24:17,180 --> 03:24:19,220
I don't know which way to go.

5441
03:24:20,120 --> 03:24:21,580
I assume like...

5442
03:24:21,580 --> 03:24:22,660
I assume like...

5443
03:24:24,730 --> 03:24:26,210
Maybe like this way.

5444
03:24:26,790 --> 03:24:29,090
Maybe like this way.

5445
03:24:29,650 --> 03:24:30,810
I'll go this way.

5446
03:24:32,090 --> 03:24:34,050
I have no idea where to go.

5447
03:24:34,570 --> 03:24:36,110
I have no idea where to go.

5448
03:24:36,110 --> 03:24:36,430
I'm a little lost.

5449
03:24:37,410 --> 03:24:38,270
Oh shit!

5450
03:24:38,310 --> 03:24:39,410
Did I go the wrong way?

5451
03:24:39,670 --> 03:24:41,430
Was it this way this entire time?

5452
03:24:41,930 --> 03:24:43,690
Guys, I think I went the wrong way.

5453
03:24:44,070 --> 03:24:44,170
Guys, I think I went the wrong way.

5454
03:24:45,230 --> 03:24:46,250
Oh my god.

5455
03:24:46,270 --> 03:24:46,570
Guys.

5456
03:24:47,670 --> 03:24:50,030
There's a possibility that I went the wrong way this entire time.

5457
03:24:53,350 --> 03:24:54,390
There's a possibility that I went the wrong way this entire time.

5458
03:24:55,030 --> 03:24:55,550
Weeeeee!

5459
03:24:56,790 --> 03:24:57,310
Weeeeee!

5460
03:24:57,310 --> 03:24:57,390
Weeeeee!

5461
03:24:57,750 --> 03:24:58,410
This way.

5462
03:24:58,850 --> 03:24:59,750
Oh, this way.

5463
03:25:01,470 --> 03:25:02,210
This way.

5464
03:25:04,470 --> 03:25:04,990
Weeeeee!

5465
03:25:06,050 --> 03:25:06,570
Weeeeee!

5466
03:25:06,710 --> 03:25:08,550
Wait, we lost our guide.

5467
03:25:08,990 --> 03:25:10,590
I don't know what to do now.

5468
03:25:10,990 --> 03:25:12,630
We lost our horse guide.

5469
03:25:13,390 --> 03:25:16,450
What do I do when we don't have a guide?

5470
03:25:17,030 --> 03:25:17,650
What do I do when we don't have a guide?

5471
03:25:18,190 --> 03:25:19,570
Is this a colossi?

5472
03:25:20,510 --> 03:25:22,710
Am I climbing a colossi right now?

5473
03:25:24,270 --> 03:25:25,450
There's no way, right?

5474
03:25:25,530 --> 03:25:25,730
No.

5475
03:25:25,930 --> 03:25:26,770
I don't think so.

5476
03:25:26,890 --> 03:25:27,650
This can't be, right?

5477
03:25:29,490 --> 03:25:30,750
Oh no, it looks fucking weird.

5478
03:25:32,790 --> 03:25:34,990
I feel like I'm climbing a colossi.

5479
03:25:35,010 --> 03:25:36,830
Like, why are there grasses growing around?

5480
03:25:37,990 --> 03:25:38,410
I feel like I'm climbing a colossi.

5481
03:25:40,750 --> 03:25:41,590
Feels like...

5482
03:25:41,590 --> 03:25:43,430
This feels like a colossi.

5483
03:25:43,450 --> 03:25:45,010
Because it's built so weird too.

5484
03:25:46,790 --> 03:25:47,170
Alright.

5485
03:25:48,610 --> 03:25:50,090
Inside I go.

5486
03:25:53,570 --> 03:25:55,250
Inside up I go.

5487
03:25:56,670 --> 03:25:57,310
Up.

5488
03:25:57,810 --> 03:25:58,570
Up.

5489
03:26:00,110 --> 03:26:01,170
Up up.

5490
03:26:02,910 --> 03:26:03,670
Alright.

5491
03:26:03,970 --> 03:26:04,490
Woah!

5492
03:26:06,290 --> 03:26:08,010
Where do I go from here?

5493
03:26:08,890 --> 03:26:09,650
What?

5494
03:26:11,650 --> 03:26:12,410
Okay.

5495
03:26:14,010 --> 03:26:14,990
Look at this.

5496
03:26:15,010 --> 03:26:15,530
Jump up?

5497
03:26:15,890 --> 03:26:17,090
Oh, I do!

5498
03:26:17,890 --> 03:26:19,250
Oh my god.

5499
03:26:19,730 --> 03:26:20,370
Guys.

5500
03:26:21,230 --> 03:26:22,870
I feel like...

5501
03:26:23,510 --> 03:26:25,130
Oh my god!

5502
03:26:25,690 --> 03:26:27,130
Yeah, I was not climbing.

5503
03:26:27,290 --> 03:26:28,610
What the fuck?

5504
03:26:33,480 --> 03:26:35,160
He's like Samurai Jack.

5505
03:26:40,540 --> 03:26:41,800
Yeah, I was not climbing.

5506
03:26:41,940 --> 03:26:43,660
I was not climbing colossi.

5507
03:26:48,740 --> 03:26:51,540
Bro, how do you have screens on when...

5508
03:26:51,540 --> 03:26:52,980
when it's raining?

5509
03:26:57,100 --> 03:26:59,280
More like Samurai Jack.

5510
03:27:00,260 --> 03:27:00,900
Wait.

5511
03:27:04,170 --> 03:27:05,110
He's like...

5512
03:27:05,110 --> 03:27:05,970
pointing at me.

5513
03:27:06,010 --> 03:27:06,170
Me?

5514
03:27:06,550 --> 03:27:07,810
Oh, he was not pointing at me!

5515
03:27:08,990 --> 03:27:12,730
Guys, he was not...

5516
03:27:12,730 --> 03:27:13,650
I'm okay.

5517
03:27:17,190 --> 03:27:19,610
Guys, he was absolutely...

5518
03:27:19,610 --> 03:27:20,970
What the fuck?

5519
03:27:30,650 --> 03:27:31,370
How?

5520
03:27:36,790 --> 03:27:37,510
How?

5521
03:27:43,740 --> 03:27:45,460
I'm gonna heal up.

5522
03:27:45,500 --> 03:27:46,820
I'm gonna heal up, guys.

5523
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:47,880
I'm not okay.

5524
03:27:48,240 --> 03:27:49,140
I'm not okay!

5525
03:27:51,220 --> 03:27:53,060
Oh my god.

5526
03:27:53,320 --> 03:27:54,960
How do I get closer?

5527
03:27:55,180 --> 03:27:55,220
Oh my god.

5528
03:27:55,240 --> 03:27:58,140
How the fuck do I get closer?

5529
03:28:00,180 --> 03:28:02,700
I'm healing so slow, too.

5530
03:28:03,400 --> 03:28:07,310
I'm healing so slow, too.

5531
03:28:07,310 --> 03:28:07,630
Okay.

5532
03:28:09,770 --> 03:28:10,450
Okay.

5533
03:28:10,610 --> 03:28:11,290
Okay.

5534
03:28:11,750 --> 03:28:12,190
What?

5535
03:28:13,270 --> 03:28:13,490
What?

5536
03:28:15,250 --> 03:28:16,250
That's bullshit!

5537
03:28:16,490 --> 03:28:17,450
That's bullshit!

5538
03:28:17,970 --> 03:28:17,990
That's bullshit!

5539
03:28:19,710 --> 03:28:22,130
I... He hit me in the air!

5540
03:28:22,630 --> 03:28:22,650
I...

5541
03:28:22,650 --> 03:28:22,650
He hit me in the air!

5542
03:28:22,770 --> 03:28:23,990
Holy shit!

5543
03:28:24,170 --> 03:28:26,390
That guy fucking hit me in the air!

5544
03:28:28,370 --> 03:28:29,910
That's so fucked up!

5545
03:28:29,990 --> 03:28:31,070
Not the heal!

5546
03:28:31,390 --> 03:28:32,830
I have to help!

5547
03:28:33,810 --> 03:28:36,190
He actually hit me in the air!

5548
03:28:36,630 --> 03:28:37,450
Alright, guys.

5549
03:28:37,590 --> 03:28:39,630
A little Super Chat reading time because...

5550
03:28:40,170 --> 03:28:41,390
I need to...

5551
03:28:41,390 --> 03:28:43,470
regen my HP apparently.

5552
03:28:45,230 --> 03:28:48,350
Thunder and Sandy is doing the same thing over and over again.

5553
03:28:48,490 --> 03:28:49,770
Expecting different results.

5554
03:28:49,950 --> 03:28:51,630
Thank you for this Super Chat.

5555
03:28:51,690 --> 03:28:52,150
Thank you.

5556
03:28:54,010 --> 03:28:55,030
We're gonna have to...

5557
03:28:55,030 --> 03:28:57,190
sit down and do some Super Chat readings.

5558
03:28:57,470 --> 03:28:57,890
Because...

5559
03:28:59,050 --> 03:29:01,230
He fucked me up real good, you guys.

5560
03:29:02,830 --> 03:29:04,670
Hiro, thank you for the Super Chat.

5561
03:29:04,830 --> 03:29:05,130
Thank you.

5562
03:29:05,590 --> 03:29:07,150
Where is Arlo?

5563
03:29:07,430 --> 03:29:08,790
When I need him!

5564
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:11,250
Cucumber, thank you for the Super Chat.

5565
03:29:11,350 --> 03:29:11,670
Thank you.

5566
03:29:11,910 --> 03:29:13,170
Where is he?

5567
03:29:14,150 --> 03:29:15,630
Where is Arlo?

5568
03:29:16,990 --> 03:29:17,510
Arlo!

5569
03:29:20,330 --> 03:29:21,410
Where are you?

5570
03:29:22,670 --> 03:29:24,530
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5571
03:29:24,650 --> 03:29:25,010
Thank you.

5572
03:29:25,590 --> 03:29:27,410
Arlo would have been able to...

5573
03:29:27,470 --> 03:29:28,670
outrun this man.

5574
03:29:29,090 --> 03:29:31,430
He would have been able to outrun...

5575
03:29:31,430 --> 03:29:32,590
his fire blast.

5576
03:29:35,450 --> 03:29:36,110
Okay.

5577
03:29:36,750 --> 03:29:38,470
Where do I go from here?

5578
03:29:39,870 --> 03:29:41,110
Oh, shit!

5579
03:29:42,010 --> 03:29:43,130
This is like...

5580
03:29:43,130 --> 03:29:43,510
bullshit.

5581
03:29:43,730 --> 03:29:44,610
Why does he do like...

5582
03:29:44,610 --> 03:29:46,110
200,000 damage?

5583
03:29:47,310 --> 03:29:48,810
Oh my god.

5584
03:29:48,930 --> 03:29:51,530
How does he do so much damage now?

5585
03:29:55,960 --> 03:29:56,620
What?

5586
03:29:57,580 --> 03:29:58,960
Where do I go?

5587
03:30:01,900 --> 03:30:02,420
What?

5588
03:30:02,840 --> 03:30:03,700
I'm trying...

5589
03:30:03,700 --> 03:30:05,700
I'm trying to find cover.

5590
03:30:06,640 --> 03:30:07,160
Bro.

5591
03:30:10,320 --> 03:30:11,160
Okay, guys.

5592
03:30:11,220 --> 03:30:11,880
Back to...

5593
03:30:11,880 --> 03:30:13,280
back to Super Chat reading.

5594
03:30:14,020 --> 03:30:16,520
Say thank you for the Super Chat.

5595
03:30:16,640 --> 03:30:17,160
Thank you.

5596
03:30:17,180 --> 03:30:17,900
Thank you.

5597
03:30:19,120 --> 03:30:20,820
Frozen, thank you for the Super Chat.

5598
03:30:20,880 --> 03:30:21,140
Thank you.

5599
03:30:21,140 --> 03:30:21,780
Thank you.

5600
03:30:21,800 --> 03:30:23,780
Just saying, Arlo would have dodged those blasts.

5601
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:25,220
Thank you for the Super Chat.

5602
03:30:25,320 --> 03:30:25,780
Thank you.

5603
03:30:25,780 --> 03:30:26,660
Thank you, guys.

5604
03:30:28,040 --> 03:30:29,340
Guys, let's back to...

5605
03:30:29,600 --> 03:30:30,740
back to the...

5606
03:30:30,740 --> 03:30:32,540
being a floor bitch real fast.

5607
03:30:33,740 --> 03:30:34,720
Okay, here we go.

5608
03:30:36,700 --> 03:30:38,940
There's no way he gets me down here.

5609
03:30:39,360 --> 03:30:40,420
There's no way.

5610
03:30:41,140 --> 03:30:42,280
There's no way.

5611
03:30:42,340 --> 03:30:42,860
There we go.

5612
03:30:42,900 --> 03:30:43,500
We have cover.

5613
03:30:43,840 --> 03:30:45,400
Where do we go from here?

5614
03:30:45,720 --> 03:30:47,040
Okay, maybe like here?

5615
03:30:48,080 --> 03:30:49,380
Okay, and then...

5616
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:49,900
Run!

5617
03:30:54,140 --> 03:30:55,360
Now where do I go?

5618
03:30:56,260 --> 03:30:56,640
Run!

5619
03:30:58,340 --> 03:30:59,040
There we go.

5620
03:30:59,080 --> 03:30:59,540
We made it.

5621
03:30:59,540 --> 03:31:01,800
Oh my god, we made it to the other hole.

5622
03:31:02,340 --> 03:31:03,580
We did it!

5623
03:31:04,580 --> 03:31:06,100
Alright, up we go.

5624
03:31:06,580 --> 03:31:07,480
I'm learning.

5625
03:31:08,200 --> 03:31:09,740
I'm learning the rolls.

5626
03:31:10,680 --> 03:31:12,280
They've taught me to roll.

5627
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:15,940
Okay, and then here we go.

5628
03:31:17,360 --> 03:31:19,440
Where do we go from here to knockdown?

5629
03:31:19,940 --> 03:31:21,540
No, I have to go this way.

5630
03:31:22,420 --> 03:31:22,980
Okay.

5631
03:31:23,280 --> 03:31:25,600
Thought I could barely see where I'm at.

5632
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:28,960
Okay, and then up we go.

5633
03:31:29,280 --> 03:31:30,620
There's no way he could see me.

5634
03:31:31,180 --> 03:31:32,560
I'm camouflaged.

5635
03:31:33,180 --> 03:31:34,740
The power of dodging.

5636
03:31:35,640 --> 03:31:37,440
This is my Dark Souls of the month.

5637
03:31:42,480 --> 03:31:45,520
Okay, I was gonna say it.

5638
03:31:45,540 --> 03:31:47,720
There's no fucking way I'm gonna die today.

5639
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:50,940
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

5640
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:51,640
I'm in the hole.

5641
03:31:51,900 --> 03:31:52,840
I'm in the hole.

5642
03:31:54,740 --> 03:31:56,880
I'm in the hole with a goal in mind.

5643
03:31:57,880 --> 03:31:58,580
Hell no.

5644
03:31:58,660 --> 03:32:00,240
Here I roll.

5645
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:05,620
Here I go up.

5646
03:32:06,020 --> 03:32:07,180
Here I go.

5647
03:32:07,320 --> 03:32:08,360
And then climb.

5648
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:09,720
And then where?

5649
03:32:10,500 --> 03:32:11,680
I'm getting closer guys.

5650
03:32:11,960 --> 03:32:12,200
Look.

5651
03:32:12,580 --> 03:32:14,820
I can see his skirt from up here.

5652
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:17,500
Oh my god, please.

5653
03:32:18,180 --> 03:32:18,700
Please!

5654
03:32:18,700 --> 03:32:20,240
Why can't you get up?

5655
03:32:24,820 --> 03:32:26,240
Go right I think.

5656
03:32:27,340 --> 03:32:28,540
It must be right.

5657
03:32:28,600 --> 03:32:29,660
Where else would I have to go?

5658
03:32:29,860 --> 03:32:30,380
RUN!

5659
03:32:31,160 --> 03:32:31,680
Nice.

5660
03:32:34,340 --> 03:32:34,860
Okay.

5661
03:32:34,860 --> 03:32:35,380
RUN!

5662
03:32:41,340 --> 03:32:41,860
RUN?

5663
03:32:43,440 --> 03:32:44,260
Oh nice.

5664
03:32:44,400 --> 03:32:44,620
Alright.

5665
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:45,520
Nice we did it.

5666
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:54,020
I was so confused cause I saw stairs and I was like do I do something that I was taught to do again?

5667
03:32:54,240 --> 03:32:55,520
I was like, there's stairs.

5668
03:32:56,440 --> 03:32:57,960
Oh shit, I'm looking up.

5669
03:32:58,720 --> 03:33:04,260
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha Guys.

5670
03:33:04,940 --> 03:33:06,260
I think I might get arrested.

5671
03:33:06,880 --> 03:33:07,600
Guys.

5672
03:33:14,410 --> 03:33:15,330
Oh fuck.

5673
03:33:15,790 --> 03:33:19,670
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha

5674
03:33:24,120 --> 03:33:25,460
Where do we climb?

5675
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:28,480
Here?

5676
03:33:28,900 --> 03:33:29,840
Oh here.

5677
03:33:30,300 --> 03:33:31,240
Okay we got it.

5678
03:33:32,100 --> 03:33:33,140
We got it.

5679
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:34,360
Nice.

5680
03:33:34,680 --> 03:33:36,000
I think it's just parkour.

5681
03:33:36,300 --> 03:33:37,380
Is this all parkour?

5682
03:33:39,260 --> 03:33:40,340
It has to be.

5683
03:33:40,440 --> 03:33:41,340
Where am I?

5684
03:33:41,460 --> 03:33:42,260
What's going on?

5685
03:33:42,600 --> 03:33:44,880
Is the wind working against me?

5686
03:33:46,540 --> 03:33:47,480
That's a thing?

5687
03:33:49,340 --> 03:33:51,100
Can I grab onto this?

5688
03:33:51,820 --> 03:33:53,360
Shoot in the air.

5689
03:33:53,700 --> 03:33:59,980
Hahahaha Hahahaha Yo, yo, yo.

5690
03:34:00,020 --> 03:34:00,940
He's so funny.

5691
03:34:04,640 --> 03:34:05,800
I'm climbing up here.

5692
03:34:06,140 --> 03:34:07,580
Am I going up?

5693
03:34:07,740 --> 03:34:08,640
I can't tell.

5694
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:18,000
I'm going to need to jump.

5695
03:34:18,940 --> 03:34:19,540
Hmmm.

5696
03:34:21,220 --> 03:34:22,420
Jump from here.

5697
03:34:23,180 --> 03:34:24,360
Oh my god.

5698
03:34:24,400 --> 03:34:26,260
This is going to take fucking forever.

5699
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:28,920
Bro, he's so fucking tall!

5700
03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:34,360
This man is so tall!

5701
03:34:34,600 --> 03:34:37,160
It's going to take fucking forever to jump up!

5702
03:34:37,560 --> 03:34:38,160
It's going to take fucking forever to jump up!

5703
03:34:38,160 --> 03:34:38,240
It's going to take fucking forever to jump up!

5704
03:34:39,220 --> 03:34:40,480
What am I going to do from here?

5705
03:34:41,320 --> 03:34:43,140
Is that thing going to get closer?

5706
03:34:46,760 --> 03:34:48,500
There's no way I'm going to hit that jump.

5707
03:34:48,740 --> 03:34:51,060
So it has to be that over here, right?

5708
03:34:51,160 --> 03:34:52,120
No, there's no way.

5709
03:34:52,200 --> 03:34:53,160
It's not going to move closer.

5710
03:34:53,840 --> 03:34:54,960
It's going to go this way.

5711
03:34:55,820 --> 03:34:57,960
I don't think that's going to move any closer to me.

5712
03:34:58,860 --> 03:34:59,260
Okay.

5713
03:35:00,660 --> 03:35:01,060
Oops.

5714
03:35:02,260 --> 03:35:04,460
Okay, where's his heart?

5715
03:35:06,440 --> 03:35:08,160
Oh yeah, it's like way up.

5716
03:35:08,200 --> 03:35:08,620
Oh my god.

5717
03:35:08,640 --> 03:35:09,360
I'm getting closer.

5718
03:35:11,720 --> 03:35:12,660
I'm getting so close.

5719
03:35:13,720 --> 03:35:14,280
Here we go.

5720
03:35:15,160 --> 03:35:15,740
Arm time!

5721
03:35:17,320 --> 03:35:18,120
Only up!

5722
03:35:20,040 --> 03:35:20,660
Oh god.

5723
03:35:21,140 --> 03:35:21,540
Woo!

5724
03:35:25,600 --> 03:35:26,360
Up back up.

5725
03:35:26,500 --> 03:35:26,640
Oh!

5726
03:35:26,700 --> 03:35:27,360
There's a spot!

5727
03:35:29,020 --> 03:35:29,760
It's right here!

5728
03:35:32,080 --> 03:35:32,580
That's right!

5729
03:35:33,580 --> 03:35:33,980
Is

5730
03:35:43,410 --> 03:35:43,710
that it?

5731
03:35:43,810 --> 03:35:44,310
Did I do it?

5732
03:35:45,270 --> 03:35:46,350
Did I fix his back?

5733
03:35:46,450 --> 03:35:46,890
I fixed it!

5734
03:35:51,830 --> 03:35:53,270
Wait, do I grab the hand?

5735
03:35:54,250 --> 03:35:54,730
Oh

5736
03:36:02,240 --> 03:36:02,640
my god.

5737
03:36:02,740 --> 03:36:03,860
It's like fast track.

5738
03:36:05,320 --> 03:36:07,580
It's like fucking fast track right here.

5739
03:36:09,900 --> 03:36:10,380
Sorry,

5740
03:36:24,410 --> 03:36:26,650
that was the most primal scream I've had in a while.

5741
03:36:30,970 --> 03:36:33,110
My life flashed before me.

5742
03:36:35,150 --> 03:36:36,110
I swear.

5743
03:36:36,430 --> 03:36:38,630
I thought I had to do this all over again.

5744
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:41,590
What a save.

5745
03:36:42,150 --> 03:36:43,390
Oh my god.

5746
03:36:44,070 --> 03:36:45,130
I had the most fun.

5747
03:36:45,130 --> 03:36:45,990
I had the most primal scream.

5748
03:36:47,910 --> 03:36:48,830
Oh my god.

5749
03:36:48,850 --> 03:36:50,230
That scared the shit out of me.

5750
03:36:50,410 --> 03:36:52,870
That actually scared the shit out of me.

5751
03:36:53,570 --> 03:36:54,550
Holy fuck.

5752
03:36:57,150 --> 03:36:58,690
Okay, we're not doing that again.

5753
03:36:59,130 --> 03:36:59,930
Am I?

5754
03:37:00,310 --> 03:37:00,830
Alright.

5755
03:37:05,620 --> 03:37:06,540
This way.

5756
03:37:10,060 --> 03:37:10,860
Here we go.

5757
03:37:11,040 --> 03:37:11,980
That's the jump.

5758
03:37:12,260 --> 03:37:13,420
Okay, we do it again.

5759
03:37:13,420 --> 03:37:15,540
We do it again.

5760
03:37:17,900 --> 03:37:19,180
Holy fuck.

5761
03:37:19,280 --> 03:37:20,500
That was so scary.

5762
03:37:25,220 --> 03:37:27,020
That was so primal.

5763
03:37:27,080 --> 03:37:30,500
You guys have no idea how fucking scary that was for me.

5764
03:37:33,780 --> 03:37:35,060
Oh my god.

5765
03:37:49,940 --> 03:37:53,660
Bro, I fucking hate this so much.

5766
03:37:54,800 --> 03:37:55,780
Not again.

5767
03:37:55,780 --> 03:37:56,000
I'm so scared.

5768
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:56,340
Not again.

5769
03:37:56,760 --> 03:37:58,360
Oh my god.

5770
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:00,360
Not again.

5771
03:38:02,420 --> 03:38:04,440
Why is this so difficult?

5772
03:38:06,080 --> 03:38:07,800
Please don't keep...

5773
03:38:07,800 --> 03:38:10,360
It's so hard to grab the arm.

5774
03:38:11,560 --> 03:38:12,240
It's so hard to grab the arm.

5775
03:38:12,240 --> 03:38:13,380
Oh my god.

5776
03:38:13,380 --> 03:38:14,000
This is sad.

5777
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:19,380
It's just like it's the gorilla all over again.

5778
03:38:19,720 --> 03:38:20,620
It's just like it's the gorilla all over again.

5779
03:38:20,620 --> 03:38:23,580
It's the gorilla all over again, chat.

5780
03:38:24,500 --> 03:38:25,980
It's the fucking gorilla.

5781
03:38:26,000 --> 03:38:26,360
Gorilla curse.

5782
03:38:26,880 --> 03:38:29,000
I blame the gorilla curse, guys.

5783
03:38:31,180 --> 03:38:32,680
It's the curse of the gorilla.

5784
03:38:36,100 --> 03:38:38,300
The curse of the fucking gorilla.

5785
03:38:41,520 --> 03:38:43,120
Oh my god, what the fuck?

5786
03:38:43,460 --> 03:38:44,840
Why can't I reach this?

5787
03:38:45,500 --> 03:38:46,060
I can't hear you.

5788
03:38:48,400 --> 03:38:48,940
Alright.

5789
03:39:00,350 --> 03:39:03,630
Hold on to his- oh wait, you mean he lifts his hand to his face?

5790
03:39:03,990 --> 03:39:05,510
Guys, I didn't know that!

5791
03:39:05,550 --> 03:39:07,090
I thought I had to climb with the arm!

5792
03:39:08,530 --> 03:39:10,350
Like the others- like the bird guy!

5793
03:39:11,410 --> 03:39:11,770
Okay.

5794
03:39:12,830 --> 03:39:13,750
I'm doing it again.

5795
03:39:13,850 --> 03:39:17,910
For the third time's a charm.

5796
03:39:17,950 --> 03:39:18,750
This time I got it.

5797
03:39:18,990 --> 03:39:20,270
Okay, I just have to climb.

5798
03:39:20,470 --> 03:39:21,230
I just gotta hold on.

5799
03:39:30,580 --> 03:39:31,360
I knew it.

5800
03:39:34,700 --> 03:39:35,420
Just climb.

5801
03:39:38,660 --> 03:39:39,540
Just climb.

5802
03:39:39,760 --> 03:39:40,240
Please.

5803
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:42,100
Just fucking climb.

5804
03:39:45,440 --> 03:39:46,380
Just climb.

5805
03:39:47,380 --> 03:39:47,940
Nooo.

5806
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:52,060
No, don't let go.

5807
03:39:52,320 --> 03:39:53,880
Don't let go, Jack.

5808
03:39:55,220 --> 03:39:55,780
We

5809
03:40:08,180 --> 03:40:09,100
gotta poke you again.

5810
03:40:09,820 --> 03:40:11,780
So I can have a better pull down.

5811
03:40:12,100 --> 03:40:12,960
For this.

5812
03:40:15,620 --> 03:40:16,180
No.

5813
03:40:16,540 --> 03:40:18,280
No, I s- Nooooo!

5814
03:40:29,870 --> 03:40:30,350
Please.

5815
03:40:37,640 --> 03:40:38,600
Just jump!

5816
03:40:38,980 --> 03:40:39,760
Oh my god!

5817
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:51,480
Nice.

5818
03:40:51,740 --> 03:40:53,240
Not nice.

5819
03:40:54,120 --> 03:40:54,960
Not nice.

5820
03:40:55,240 --> 03:40:55,720
Wooo!

5821
03:40:56,020 --> 03:40:56,500
Wooo!

5822
03:40:57,800 --> 03:40:59,060
Not nice, guys!

5823
03:41:03,410 --> 03:41:05,710
Not nice, not nice, not nice, not nice.

5824
03:41:07,090 --> 03:41:09,130
Please tell me there's something to grab on here!

5825
03:41:09,310 --> 03:41:09,550
Please tell me there's something to grab on here!

5826
03:41:09,550 --> 03:41:10,310
Oh, thank god!

5827
03:41:10,910 --> 03:41:13,550
Oh, thank god, oh thank god, thank god.

5828
03:41:13,690 --> 03:41:15,570
I think I fucked it up though.

5829
03:41:15,890 --> 03:41:16,630
I think I fucked it up though.

5830
03:41:16,630 --> 03:41:17,990
Unless... No!

5831
03:41:18,710 --> 03:41:19,710
I'm gonna start off from the-

5832
03:41:28,760 --> 03:41:32,920
Alright, here we go again.

5833
03:42:30,430 --> 03:42:32,550
All of them are getting blacklisted.

5834
03:42:32,690 --> 03:42:33,670
Fuck all of these guys.

5835
03:42:35,370 --> 03:42:35,890
Alright.

5836
03:42:37,170 --> 03:42:37,690
What

5837
03:42:41,360 --> 03:42:43,360
do I jump do again?

5838
03:42:43,720 --> 03:42:44,240
What

5839
03:42:49,640 --> 03:42:50,220
do I jump do again?

5840
03:42:50,220 --> 03:42:50,360
Please.

5841
03:42:51,020 --> 03:42:52,620
Get on top of the pump!

5842
03:42:55,760 --> 03:42:56,680
Stab the head!

5843
03:42:57,380 --> 03:42:57,740
Stab the head!

5844
03:42:57,740 --> 03:42:58,500
I did it!

5845
03:42:58,520 --> 03:42:59,880
Stab the

5846
03:43:05,190 --> 03:43:05,790
- BACKWARDS!

5847
03:43:09,880 --> 03:43:13,100
Guys, I think I went backwards... again.

5848
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:18,600
Guys, I went backwards.

5849
03:43:23,560 --> 03:43:24,360
Shoot

5850
03:43:33,890 --> 03:43:35,450
for - But there's fire!

5851
03:43:37,710 --> 03:43:39,290
There's fire though!

5852
03:43:40,110 --> 03:43:41,290
I'm scared!

5853
03:43:41,290 --> 03:43:41,570
I'm scared!

5854
03:43:49,280 --> 03:43:50,500
We need to recharge a little.

5855
03:43:50,620 --> 03:43:51,480
We gotta recharge a little.

5856
03:43:51,780 --> 03:43:53,320
Woah, woah, woah, woah!

5857
03:43:53,780 --> 03:43:54,140
Woah, woah, woah, woah!

5858
03:43:55,560 --> 03:43:55,920
Okay.

5859
03:44:01,490 --> 03:44:02,570
Oh no, please.

5860
03:44:02,670 --> 03:44:03,450
I'm so scared.

5861
03:44:05,830 --> 03:44:07,850
Just chill, just chill, just chill!

5862
03:44:08,570 --> 03:44:09,470
Oh, I see it!

5863
03:44:09,530 --> 03:44:10,030
I see it!

5864
03:44:10,070 --> 03:44:10,530
I see it!

5865
03:44:20,120 --> 03:44:20,900
Did you see it?

5866
03:44:21,820 --> 03:44:22,180
I'm

5867
03:44:26,140 --> 03:44:26,360
scared.

5868
03:44:26,400 --> 03:44:26,860
I got scared.

5869
03:44:26,920 --> 03:44:27,820
I thought I fucked it up.

5870
03:44:27,840 --> 03:44:28,860
I thought I fucked it up.

5871
03:44:28,860 --> 03:44:31,140
Oh my god, I thought I fucked it up.

5872
03:44:31,520 --> 03:44:32,000
Oh,

5873
03:44:37,020 --> 03:44:37,840
we're okay.

5874
03:44:43,210 --> 03:44:43,690
Guys.

5875
03:44:44,530 --> 03:44:45,010
Guys.

5876
03:44:45,070 --> 03:44:45,550
Guys.

5877
03:44:45,550 --> 03:44:46,310
I'm so scared.

5878
03:44:46,770 --> 03:44:47,250
Guys.

5879
03:44:48,750 --> 03:44:49,330
Oh no.

5880
03:44:51,670 --> 03:44:52,430
Oh god.

5881
03:44:54,270 --> 03:44:55,330
I'm so scared.

5882
03:44:56,150 --> 03:44:57,510
Guys, I'm so scared.

5883
03:44:58,030 --> 03:44:59,690
Guys, I'm so scared.

5884
03:44:59,690 --> 03:45:00,790
The other shoulder?

5885
03:45:02,110 --> 03:45:04,230
Where do I- It's right here.

5886
03:45:04,230 --> 03:45:05,590
It's right here.

5887
03:45:05,750 --> 03:45:07,570
Oh my god, we've made it.

5888
03:45:07,870 --> 03:45:08,550
No!

5889
03:45:09,150 --> 03:45:09,830
No!

5890
03:45:10,310 --> 03:45:13,220
Oh shit!

5891
03:45:13,980 --> 03:45:14,960
Holy fuck!

5892
03:45:15,220 --> 03:45:15,340
That

5893
03:45:24,290 --> 03:45:28,490
was so close.

5894
03:45:30,930 --> 03:45:32,550
That was so close.

5895
03:45:33,130 --> 03:45:33,810
That was so close.

5896
03:45:33,810 --> 03:45:35,550
Oh my god, that was...

5897
03:45:35,550 --> 03:45:36,690
Not cool.

5898
03:45:36,690 --> 03:45:38,290
That fucked it all up, guys.

5899
03:45:38,790 --> 03:45:38,890
Not cool.

5900
03:45:38,890 --> 03:45:38,890
That fucked it all up, guys.

5901
03:45:39,730 --> 03:45:40,410
Okay.

5902
03:45:42,270 --> 03:45:43,270
We made it.

5903
03:45:43,510 --> 03:45:45,430
After 20 years!

5904
03:45:46,030 --> 03:45:47,050
We made it!

5905
03:45:47,050 --> 03:45:47,050
After 20 years!

5906
03:45:47,070 --> 03:45:47,550
We made it!

5907
03:45:47,870 --> 03:45:48,510
Oh!

5908
03:45:51,170 --> 03:45:52,010
We

5909
03:46:02,980 --> 03:46:03,540
gotta get closer.

5910
03:46:04,380 --> 03:46:06,800
One last acupuncture!

5911
03:46:07,840 --> 03:46:08,900
Oh god.

5912
03:46:09,200 --> 03:46:09,980
Sir!

5913
03:46:11,880 --> 03:46:15,100
Sir, you need this inch for your-

5914
03:46:21,610 --> 03:46:23,290
Jesus Christ!

5915
03:46:23,730 --> 03:46:25,030
Oh my god.

5916
03:46:25,670 --> 03:46:26,430
Oh my god.

5917
03:46:26,430 --> 03:46:26,430
Stop!

5918
03:46:34,070 --> 03:46:35,670
Just let me do my job!

5919
03:46:36,110 --> 03:46:36,830
Just let me do my job!

5920
03:46:42,400 --> 03:46:43,240
Okay.

5921
03:46:46,000 --> 03:46:48,180
Jesus Christ, why is the safe so light?

5922
03:46:48,740 --> 03:46:50,540
Am I like not at the head?

5923
03:46:51,360 --> 03:46:54,520
I can't tell because I'm swinging so much!

5924
03:46:55,540 --> 03:46:56,800
Here we go.

5925
03:46:58,840 --> 03:47:01,400
I couldn't tell if I'm poking it correctly.

5926
03:47:04,880 --> 03:47:05,440
Zing!

5927
03:47:05,520 --> 03:47:06,460
That sounds like me.

5928
03:47:08,060 --> 03:47:10,780
Not gonna lie, that sounds just like me.

5929
03:47:14,460 --> 03:47:14,900
Look!

5930
03:47:14,900 --> 03:47:16,840
He keeps swinging his head!

5931
03:47:16,980 --> 03:47:18,700
Of course I was gonna miss eventually!

5932
03:47:20,280 --> 03:47:23,320
Oh my god, I'm getting a little scared now.

5933
03:47:23,400 --> 03:47:24,340
I feel like I'm gonna fall now.

5934
03:47:25,180 --> 03:47:26,220
Not gonna lie.

5935
03:47:27,320 --> 03:47:28,700
Charge it just a little bit.

5936
03:47:28,840 --> 03:47:29,440
Nice, okay.

5937
03:47:32,060 --> 03:47:34,160
Oh thank god, okay I didn't miss this time.

5938
03:47:34,380 --> 03:47:37,460
Sorry, I might have actually hit your brain, but don't worry, don't worry.

5939
03:47:38,080 --> 03:47:40,760
Here is a coupon for one free coin.

5940
03:47:40,780 --> 03:47:41,700
Free head massage?

5941
03:47:45,100 --> 03:47:47,160
Don't worry sir, don't worry.

5942
03:47:47,780 --> 03:47:50,720
They weren't the important parts in your brain, guys.

5943
03:47:50,840 --> 03:47:55,960
It wasn't like... it wasn't like the important parts in the brain, so do not worry.

5944
03:47:56,480 --> 03:47:57,660
Do not worry sir.

5945
03:47:57,920 --> 03:47:58,740
You'll be fine.

5946
03:47:59,460 --> 03:48:00,400
You'll be fine.

5947
03:48:01,220 --> 03:48:01,740
Okay.

5948
03:48:01,740 --> 03:48:02,940
I have no time.

5949
03:48:04,080 --> 03:48:05,020
Oh thank god.

5950
03:48:05,060 --> 03:48:06,120
Okay, I have one more stab.

5951
03:48:06,640 --> 03:48:07,640
One more stab.

5952
03:48:08,480 --> 03:48:09,520
Come on sir.

5953
03:48:09,700 --> 03:48:10,180
Sir!

5954
03:48:10,780 --> 03:48:11,180
Okay!

5955
03:48:13,780 --> 03:48:14,520
Oh god.

5956
03:48:15,240 --> 03:48:16,120
Oh god.

5957
03:48:16,300 --> 03:48:17,820
I saw myself stumble.

5958
03:48:18,200 --> 03:48:19,040
Oh god.

5959
03:48:19,280 --> 03:48:22,120
It would be a doki moment if I fell right now.

5960
03:48:22,360 --> 03:48:24,800
It would truly be the most doki moment.

5961
03:48:25,340 --> 03:48:25,700
No!

5962
03:48:25,960 --> 03:48:27,420
You fucking kidding me!

5963
03:48:27,880 --> 03:48:29,180
They warned me!

5964
03:48:31,580 --> 03:48:33,400
I mean like, one more stress point.

5965
03:48:35,740 --> 03:48:36,380
Boom.

5966
03:48:39,060 --> 03:48:40,460
We did it!

5967
03:48:41,100 --> 03:48:45,940
We hope you will enjoy the doki bird acupuncture experience.

5968
03:48:47,640 --> 03:48:49,820
Not the doki moment.

5969
03:48:54,000 --> 03:48:54,920
Oh my god.

5970
03:48:54,980 --> 03:48:57,700
All that stress toxin coming out right now.

5971
03:48:58,220 --> 03:48:59,440
Where am I?

5972
03:48:59,560 --> 03:49:00,640
Oh shit!

5973
03:49:01,740 --> 03:49:02,140
Hehehehe.

5974
03:49:04,200 --> 03:49:05,000
Nightmare Slain.

5975
03:49:05,120 --> 03:49:05,980
I did it!

5976
03:49:07,600 --> 03:49:08,500
I'm a hero!

5977
03:49:11,700 --> 03:49:13,060
Oh my god, they're coming to my turf.

5978
03:49:13,260 --> 03:49:13,800
Get out!

5979
03:49:14,200 --> 03:49:15,540
This is my clientele!

5980
03:49:19,080 --> 03:49:20,720
Why does he have a white horse?

5981
03:49:20,980 --> 03:49:22,560
How does he get to be so special?

5982
03:49:25,500 --> 03:49:26,940
What is he doing on my turf?

5983
03:49:30,460 --> 03:49:31,820
Here, thank you for the super chat.

5984
03:49:31,900 --> 03:49:32,160
Thank you.

5985
03:49:32,300 --> 03:49:32,620
Thank you.

5986
03:49:41,970 --> 03:49:43,950
The rival Aki punch you.

5987
03:49:49,030 --> 03:49:50,390
What are you doing?

5988
03:49:52,550 --> 03:49:54,070
Bro, he has a mask too?

5989
03:49:54,310 --> 03:49:56,150
That's when you know he's like a professional.

5990
03:50:01,190 --> 03:50:04,090
Did you remember to pay your perfection protection?

5991
03:50:04,270 --> 03:50:05,650
I am the protection!

5992
03:50:05,990 --> 03:50:06,690
What do you mean?

5993
03:50:06,790 --> 03:50:07,670
This is my turf!

5994
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:21,040
Oh my god, is she better now?

5995
03:50:21,280 --> 03:50:22,080
Is she healed?

5996
03:50:28,780 --> 03:50:29,820
Lord Imon?

5997
03:50:30,120 --> 03:50:31,560
He gets to be a lord?

5998
03:50:31,880 --> 03:50:33,740
Oh, that's when I killed the last colossus.

5999
03:50:40,220 --> 03:50:42,820
Yay, now it's so roomy now.

6000
03:50:43,460 --> 03:50:45,220
Look at all the space.

6001
03:50:58,260 --> 03:50:59,880
I'll get the taxi back home.

6002
03:51:09,620 --> 03:51:10,920
Is she better now?

6003
03:51:14,940 --> 03:51:15,840
I did it!

6004
03:51:15,900 --> 03:51:16,960
I healed my girlfriend!

6005
03:51:18,100 --> 03:51:20,540
Now it's Doki turns for being stabbed.

6006
03:51:21,120 --> 03:51:22,380
Noisy, thank you for the super chat.

6007
03:51:22,440 --> 03:51:23,020
Thank you, thank you.

6008
03:51:23,060 --> 03:51:23,420
What do you mean?

6009
03:51:23,460 --> 03:51:24,460
I'm the good guy, right?

6010
03:51:25,400 --> 03:51:27,140
That looks like a good guy right there.

6011
03:51:27,940 --> 03:51:29,220
Is he doing Yamcha pose?

6012
03:51:46,570 --> 03:51:47,930
Oh my god, I can fly now.

6013
03:51:53,710 --> 03:51:54,650
That's the Peter pose.

6014
03:51:54,750 --> 03:51:55,290
Oh yeah, you're right.

6015
03:51:55,350 --> 03:51:56,570
That's more like the Peter pose.

6016
03:51:57,990 --> 03:51:59,910
The family guy pose.

6017
03:52:07,840 --> 03:52:10,240
What are they doing to my girlfriend?

6018
03:52:15,460 --> 03:52:16,620
What are you doing?

6019
03:52:16,700 --> 03:52:17,360
Hands off.

6020
03:52:23,520 --> 03:52:25,600
That's right or I'll get very angry.

6021
03:52:29,950 --> 03:52:31,670
All my friends are here.

6022
03:52:32,010 --> 03:52:33,090
All my clients.

6023
03:52:34,310 --> 03:52:35,970
My five star review.

6024
03:52:36,830 --> 03:52:38,250
Bro, I look so...

6025
03:52:38,450 --> 03:52:38,730
Okay.

6026
03:52:46,010 --> 03:52:49,970
What have I done?

6027
03:52:50,050 --> 03:52:51,170
I got my girlfriend back.

6028
03:53:01,510 --> 03:53:04,030
Look, if it was forbidden, you should have made a sign.

6029
03:53:13,860 --> 03:53:16,840
I'm like a horned angel, right?

6030
03:53:17,140 --> 03:53:18,700
Angels have horns, right?

6031
03:53:29,430 --> 03:53:30,070
Oh.

6032
03:53:34,090 --> 03:53:35,070
My knee.

6033
03:53:36,590 --> 03:53:37,410
Bro, what?

6034
03:53:37,550 --> 03:53:38,870
Skyrim hasn't come out yet.

6035
03:53:39,510 --> 03:53:41,410
Oh my god, this was...

6036
03:53:41,410 --> 03:53:42,630
The last...

6037
03:53:42,630 --> 03:53:43,310
The last...

6038
03:53:43,310 --> 03:53:43,470
The last...

6039
03:53:44,570 --> 03:53:47,830
The last Colossus walked so Skyrim can run.

6040
03:53:47,990 --> 03:53:50,230
The last Colossus walked so Skyrim can run.

6041
03:53:50,230 --> 03:53:50,670
The last Colossus walked so Skyrim can run.

6042
03:53:54,590 --> 03:53:55,190
Acupuncture...

6043
03:53:55,190 --> 03:53:56,270
No, not the...

6044
03:53:56,270 --> 03:53:57,510
No way!

6045
03:53:59,810 --> 03:54:02,070
I mean, it's like hair salon, people.

6046
03:54:02,410 --> 03:54:02,530
I mean, it's like hair salon, people.

6047
03:54:02,530 --> 03:54:03,450
Wait, am I going to die?

6048
03:54:10,160 --> 03:54:10,760
Oh

6049
03:54:14,240 --> 03:54:16,480
my god, my stress juice!

6050
03:54:16,880 --> 03:54:18,700
I was so fucking stressed.

6051
03:54:18,700 --> 03:54:19,000
I'm stressed.

6052
03:54:19,360 --> 03:54:22,840
The last acupuncture is just acupuncture.

6053
03:54:27,300 --> 03:54:28,520
Taster, I think you missed.

6054
03:54:31,720 --> 03:54:32,860
Bro, you know what?

6055
03:54:32,920 --> 03:54:34,200
I was pretty stressed out.

6056
03:54:36,140 --> 03:54:38,040
I was definitely pretty stressed out.

6057
03:54:43,530 --> 03:54:45,430
Yo, I finally got my own obsession.

6058
03:54:53,540 --> 03:54:55,160
At least talk to my girlfriend.

6059
03:54:59,720 --> 03:55:00,580
She looks live!

6060
03:55:00,740 --> 03:55:02,440
She has blood in her face now.

6061
03:55:10,580 --> 03:55:12,340
All the stress is coming out.

6062
03:55:23,800 --> 03:55:26,520
I was so fucking stressed, man.

6063
03:55:38,280 --> 03:55:39,940
Another happy client.

6064
03:55:56,540 --> 03:55:56,980
I

6065
03:56:18,130 --> 03:56:19,510
didn't have to work so hard.

6066
03:56:20,050 --> 03:56:20,210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6067
03:56:20,210 --> 03:56:20,990
I was just going to be a huge, massive, huge fan.

6068
03:56:20,990 --> 03:56:21,690
You're a big fan of the next episode.

6069
03:56:21,710 --> 03:56:22,070
Yeah.

6070
03:56:22,070 --> 03:56:22,530
That's right.

6071
03:56:22,530 --> 03:56:22,650
I'm gonna have to find...

6072
03:56:23,170 --> 03:56:24,470
I guess it's a good thing.

6073
03:56:25,410 --> 03:56:26,610
I'm not gonna give it a go at this point.

6074
03:56:27,390 --> 03:56:28,730
I'm gonna keep it consistently.

6075
03:56:28,750 --> 03:56:29,210
Just like I always say, this is just a month.

6076
03:56:32,390 --> 03:56:34,130
Well, in your book...

6077
03:56:34,730 --> 03:56:37,210
Thanks, man.

6078
03:56:37,210 --> 03:56:37,350
Yeah.

6079
03:56:43,660 --> 03:56:44,960
Can't beat a bad guy.

6080
03:56:45,040 --> 03:56:45,920
He's got...

6081
03:56:47,060 --> 03:56:47,540
Wait,

6082
03:57:07,800 --> 03:57:08,380
am I gonna kill him?

6083
03:57:08,680 --> 03:57:09,580
Oh my god!

6084
03:57:09,620 --> 03:57:10,300
I'm the good guy!

6085
03:57:10,480 --> 03:57:11,000
Let's go!

6086
03:57:17,520 --> 03:57:18,360
I'm good!

6087
03:57:19,980 --> 03:57:22,020
What the fuck do I do?

6088
03:57:25,340 --> 03:57:26,720
That's fucking right!

6089
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:29,220
I'm the good guy!

6090
03:57:31,500 --> 03:57:32,580
Doki smash!

6091
03:57:35,150 --> 03:57:36,480
I can't see anything!

6092
03:57:37,180 --> 03:57:39,040
Where am I getting hit by?

6093
03:57:40,420 --> 03:57:41,980
Where are the people at?

6094
03:57:42,060 --> 03:57:42,740
You're so tiny!

6095
03:57:45,140 --> 03:57:47,200
Oh my god, where are they?

6096
03:57:48,220 --> 03:57:49,200
Oh, here you are.

6097
03:57:49,280 --> 03:57:49,900
Here you are.

6098
03:57:49,940 --> 03:57:50,300
I see you.

6099
03:57:50,340 --> 03:57:51,340
I got you in the corner.

6100
03:57:51,700 --> 03:57:52,240
Bam!

6101
03:57:55,660 --> 03:57:56,800
That's fucking right.

6102
03:57:58,640 --> 03:57:59,680
Doki smash!

6103
03:58:01,180 --> 03:58:02,580
For justice!

6104
03:58:06,770 --> 03:58:07,120
Bam!

6105
03:58:07,120 --> 03:58:09,060
How do I keep missing?

6106
03:58:12,200 --> 03:58:16,740
Can you guys walk a little further up so I can actually hit you guys?

6107
03:58:17,860 --> 03:58:20,320
Okay, I'm trying to figure out the perspective.

6108
03:58:20,900 --> 03:58:21,420
Okay.

6109
03:58:21,640 --> 03:58:24,460
Guys, I've realized...

6110
03:58:24,460 --> 03:58:25,960
Guys, I've realized...

6111
03:58:26,650 --> 03:58:30,760
I've realized that being Colossus is really difficult.

6112
03:58:30,760 --> 03:58:33,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

6113
03:58:33,920 --> 03:58:35,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

6114
03:58:35,680 --> 03:58:37,340
Dude, they're getting away!

6115
03:58:38,160 --> 03:58:38,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

6116
03:58:38,980 --> 03:58:40,480
God, how are you so slow?

6117
03:58:40,900 --> 03:58:41,320
God, how are you so slow?!

6118
03:58:41,320 --> 03:58:42,080
Ha ha ha ha ha!

6119
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:44,520
Ha ha ha ha ha!

6120
03:58:48,040 --> 03:58:50,380
Bro, I can't believe.

6121
03:58:51,560 --> 03:58:52,740
The more you...

6122
03:58:52,740 --> 03:58:55,160
No wonder they were so stressed out.

6123
03:59:00,080 --> 03:59:01,940
Now I know how they feel.

6124
03:59:12,370 --> 03:59:13,710
What is he gonna do?

6125
03:59:20,220 --> 03:59:21,080
What is that?

6126
03:59:36,350 --> 03:59:38,230
He just throws the sword?

6127
03:59:43,940 --> 03:59:44,580
What?

6128
03:59:46,540 --> 03:59:47,180
Oh,

6129
03:59:53,860 --> 03:59:54,600
his mask!

6130
03:59:54,680 --> 03:59:55,020
It's handmade!

6131
03:59:55,740 --> 03:59:56,960
Oh, and it's still there.

6132
03:59:57,080 --> 03:59:57,580
That's good.

6133
03:59:59,900 --> 04:00:00,540
I

6134
04:00:13,240 --> 04:00:15,000
have so my girlfriend!

6135
04:00:25,000 --> 04:00:28,260
I can't believe the good guy is losing.

6136
04:00:30,780 --> 04:00:32,280
I couldn't even...

6137
04:00:32,740 --> 04:00:34,220
Don't grab onto it!

6138
04:00:35,360 --> 04:00:35,580
No!

6139
04:00:46,330 --> 04:00:46,770
Bro!

6140
04:00:46,950 --> 04:00:47,830
Can you grab the wall?

6141
04:00:48,770 --> 04:00:51,390
If I learn everything, I just need to grab...

6142
04:00:52,130 --> 04:00:52,830
Oh, fuck it.

6143
04:00:52,830 --> 04:00:53,070
Let's go.

6144
04:00:53,410 --> 04:00:54,170
Oh, fuck it.

6145
04:00:54,170 --> 04:00:54,390
Let's go.

6146
04:00:57,250 --> 04:00:58,190
Oh, fuck it.

6147
04:00:58,310 --> 04:00:58,490
Let's go.

6148
04:01:08,180 --> 04:01:10,160
Hold onto something!

6149
04:01:15,050 --> 04:01:16,160
I've accepted it.

6150
04:01:16,300 --> 04:01:18,020
I accepted it.

6151
04:01:27,860 --> 04:01:29,390
Just grab something.

6152
04:01:29,810 --> 04:01:31,410
My license for books.

6153
04:01:33,030 --> 04:01:34,690
I can't believe it!

6154
04:01:34,830 --> 04:01:37,570
How did they know this wasn't a real license?

6155
04:01:55,370 --> 04:01:56,790
How did they know?

6156
04:01:57,450 --> 04:02:01,010
How did... I can't believe the inspector came!

6157
04:02:02,370 --> 04:02:06,360
I did my job perfectly!

6158
04:02:06,620 --> 04:02:08,460
I watched the YouTube guides!

6159
04:02:13,170 --> 04:02:14,770
I can't believe it.

6160
04:02:14,770 --> 04:02:15,750
The inspector came.

6161
04:02:15,810 --> 04:02:16,590
Who called on me?

6162
04:02:16,750 --> 04:02:19,790
Who like ratted me out to the inspectors?

6163
04:02:19,790 --> 04:02:21,690
To the acupuncture inspectors?

6164
04:02:28,910 --> 04:02:30,250
They just left her?

6165
04:02:30,370 --> 04:02:30,590
I don't know.

6166
04:02:30,590 --> 04:02:31,870
After all that?

6167
04:02:32,170 --> 04:02:33,590
I guess because they thought she was dead.

6168
04:02:40,150 --> 04:02:40,830
She's alive!

6169
04:02:42,190 --> 04:02:43,010
Look at her!

6170
04:02:43,270 --> 04:02:45,010
Now she's less dead looking.

6171
04:02:52,700 --> 04:02:54,500
They'll be like, how the fuck did I get here?

6172
04:02:56,840 --> 04:02:58,120
She's like, what the fuck?

6173
04:02:58,160 --> 04:02:58,600
Where am I?

6174
04:03:23,480 --> 04:03:25,360
The power of acupuncture.

6175
04:03:25,780 --> 04:03:26,540
It works.

6176
04:03:27,700 --> 04:03:30,820
Even if my license wasn't real, my skills were.

6177
04:03:38,820 --> 04:03:40,240
She just walked away?

6178
04:03:41,820 --> 04:03:43,880
She doesn't even know where the fuck to go?

6179
04:03:51,340 --> 04:03:53,320
Oh my god, I can control the camera.

6180
04:03:53,840 --> 04:03:54,480
Arlo!

6181
04:03:54,760 --> 04:03:55,780
I knew it!

6182
04:03:55,780 --> 04:03:56,840
Minecraft was right!

6183
04:03:58,100 --> 04:03:58,740
I

6184
04:04:03,090 --> 04:04:04,670
knew horses can swim!

6185
04:04:05,810 --> 04:04:07,610
I fucking knew it!

6186
04:04:08,150 --> 04:04:08,790
Arlo!

6187
04:04:08,950 --> 04:04:10,310
Are you limping?

6188
04:04:10,490 --> 04:04:11,470
Oh no!

6189
04:04:13,550 --> 04:04:14,830
Oh no!

6190
04:04:15,830 --> 04:04:16,670
Oh no!

6191
04:04:16,670 --> 04:04:17,170
Oh no!

6192
04:04:17,170 --> 04:04:17,690
No!

6193
04:04:27,160 --> 04:04:29,540
Oh, Arlo stealing your girl!

6194
04:04:29,800 --> 04:04:30,640
Broken bot!

6195
04:04:30,780 --> 04:04:31,760
Thank you for the super chat!

6196
04:04:31,900 --> 04:04:32,200
Thank you!

6197
04:04:32,240 --> 04:04:32,700
Thank you!

6198
04:04:34,740 --> 04:04:35,980
I fucking knew it!

6199
04:04:36,000 --> 04:04:36,940
Minecraft was right!

6200
04:04:37,860 --> 04:04:38,840
We did it!

6201
04:04:41,720 --> 04:04:42,240
Saved!

6202
04:04:42,240 --> 04:04:44,580
I knew I was the good guy all along!

6203
04:04:46,140 --> 04:04:47,460
Oh my god!

6204
04:04:47,860 --> 04:04:51,020
We fucking- Oh, these are all the dead that Colossa have killed.

6205
04:04:52,180 --> 04:04:54,220
Oh, they like become one with the nature.

6206
04:04:55,120 --> 04:04:55,740
Afterwards.

6207
04:04:57,320 --> 04:04:58,680
We did it chat!

6208
04:05:00,970 --> 04:05:01,760
Oh my god.

6209
04:05:02,160 --> 04:05:03,780
We fucking did it.

6210
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:05,640
We beat the game.

6211
04:05:05,700 --> 04:05:07,000
Another game completed!

6212
04:05:08,400 --> 04:05:09,560
We did it!

6213
04:05:09,580 --> 04:05:11,240
Thank you for coming to the journey!

6214
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:14,560
Of Shadow Colossi!

6215
04:05:15,040 --> 04:05:15,660
Colossus!

6216
04:05:17,900 --> 04:05:19,320
Wait, is there an after credit?

6217
04:05:19,320 --> 04:05:22,160
Alright, let me turn down the sound a little bit.

6218
04:05:23,080 --> 04:05:24,260
There's an after credit?

6219
04:05:25,980 --> 04:05:26,500
Okay.

6220
04:05:26,640 --> 04:05:27,060
Alright.

6221
04:05:27,180 --> 04:05:27,640
Nice.

6222
04:05:27,780 --> 04:05:27,960
Alright.

6223
04:05:28,040 --> 04:05:29,840
We'll wait until the after credit then.

6224
04:05:30,460 --> 04:05:31,420
Oh my god!

6225
04:05:31,560 --> 04:05:32,340
Good job!

6226
04:05:32,400 --> 04:05:32,980
I did it!

6227
04:05:33,020 --> 04:05:33,540
Thank you!

6228
04:05:33,800 --> 04:05:34,320
I won!

6229
04:05:34,720 --> 04:05:35,440
Poor Chester!

6230
04:05:35,580 --> 04:05:36,380
Thank you for the super chat!

6231
04:05:36,480 --> 04:05:36,740
Thank you!

6232
04:05:36,780 --> 04:05:37,440
Thank you!

6233
04:05:38,060 --> 04:05:39,160
Oh my god.

6234
04:05:39,200 --> 04:05:40,200
What a journey.

6235
04:05:40,440 --> 04:05:41,440
What a journey.

6236
04:05:41,600 --> 04:05:47,340
Opening up my massage parlor, being the very best, and still having my license taken from me?

6237
04:05:47,340 --> 04:05:49,280
I can't believe it.

6238
04:05:49,340 --> 04:05:50,540
I was doing such a great job.

6239
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:52,400
It's like those honorary degrees.

6240
04:05:52,620 --> 04:05:57,280
I should have gotten an honorary license for all the Colossus I've saved.

6241
04:06:00,300 --> 04:06:02,820
All the fucking stress I helped get rid of.

6242
04:06:03,140 --> 04:06:05,380
Someone had to call the inspector.

6243
04:06:05,860 --> 04:06:06,620
No fun.

6244
04:06:10,820 --> 04:06:15,880
Now Arlo and girl get to eat grass worms and lizard tails in this peaceful land.

6245
04:06:16,220 --> 04:06:17,320
They give us a super chat.

6246
04:06:17,340 --> 04:06:19,420
Uh, Cas, thank you.

6247
04:06:19,460 --> 04:06:20,060
Thank you.

6248
04:06:20,220 --> 04:06:22,000
I did such a good job too!

6249
04:06:22,680 --> 04:06:25,880
I got like five star Yelp reviews and everything.

6250
04:06:26,320 --> 04:06:27,440
I don't understand.

6251
04:06:27,860 --> 04:06:28,740
I don't...

6252
04:06:28,740 --> 04:06:32,540
I don't understand.

6253
04:06:32,780 --> 04:06:34,920
How did... how did this happen?

6254
04:06:38,680 --> 04:06:40,280
That was really fun.

6255
04:06:40,520 --> 04:06:42,520
I don't know what series to do next week though.

6256
04:06:42,720 --> 04:06:45,620
I'm trying to think of like what my new series should be.

6257
04:06:48,440 --> 04:06:50,140
There's so many games I want to play.

6258
04:06:50,380 --> 04:06:52,820
So I don't know which one to start first.

6259
04:06:53,680 --> 04:06:56,920
Um... I might do... I don't know actually.

6260
04:06:57,040 --> 04:07:01,220
I don't know which game to do next because there's like so many I want to play.

6261
04:07:01,640 --> 04:07:03,800
There's so many games I've always wanted to play.

6262
04:07:03,940 --> 04:07:06,860
So it's always hard to figure out the next series.

6263
04:07:07,420 --> 04:07:12,040
Um, but I have like a backlog of... I wrote down a backlog of games that I wanted...

6264
04:07:12,040 --> 04:07:13,300
Oh my gosh, wait, it's still going?

6265
04:07:13,460 --> 04:07:14,940
Oh my god, they're breaking the bridges.

6266
04:07:14,940 --> 04:07:16,900
You can go on top of that bridge?

6267
04:07:18,080 --> 04:07:19,180
How come I could never?

6268
04:07:22,600 --> 04:07:23,680
What the fuck?

6269
04:07:24,580 --> 04:07:25,860
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

6270
04:07:25,940 --> 04:07:26,200
Thank you.

6271
04:07:26,220 --> 04:07:26,660
Thank you.

6272
04:07:26,660 --> 04:07:29,780
You can't have your license taken away if you never had one to be going.

6273
04:07:29,880 --> 04:07:30,300
Oh, true.

6274
04:07:30,800 --> 04:07:31,200
True.

6275
04:07:31,260 --> 04:07:32,980
I have an honorary license.

6276
04:07:33,160 --> 04:07:34,080
Thank you for the super chat.

6277
04:07:34,140 --> 04:07:34,440
Thank you.

6278
04:07:34,540 --> 04:07:34,880
Thank you.

6279
04:07:35,920 --> 04:07:36,820
Oh my god.

6280
04:07:37,400 --> 04:07:38,380
What the fuck?

6281
04:07:38,540 --> 04:07:40,740
You could be on top of that this whole time?

6282
04:07:42,400 --> 04:07:43,860
I've always been under there.

6283
04:07:44,940 --> 04:07:45,760
Oh my god.

6284
04:07:51,940 --> 04:07:53,480
I don't know man.

6285
04:07:53,680 --> 04:07:54,540
Just... just try.

6286
04:07:54,780 --> 04:07:54,900
I don't know man.

6287
04:07:54,900 --> 04:07:54,900
Just...

6288
04:07:54,900 --> 04:07:54,900
just try.

6289
04:07:54,920 --> 04:07:55,820
Man, I must not go on this anymore.

6290
04:07:57,760 --> 04:07:59,560
It's just me and my mother.

6291
04:08:00,580 --> 04:08:02,780
The only other thing that matters is that I'm alive.

6292
04:08:02,860 --> 04:08:02,940
That's the only other thing that matters.

6293
04:08:02,940 --> 04:08:03,560
That's the only other thing that matters.

6294
04:08:03,560 --> 04:08:04,400
Hope you'll let me know that you're alive.

6295
04:08:09,480 --> 04:08:15,180
I saved my girlfriend.

6296
04:08:15,660 --> 04:08:15,840
You saved my girlfriend?

6297
04:08:15,840 --> 04:08:16,100
Yeah.

6298
04:08:17,080 --> 04:08:17,560
What do you mean?

6299
04:08:22,840 --> 04:08:24,620
I mean this whole game was about climbing.

6300
04:08:24,780 --> 04:08:25,220
Just climb.

6301
04:08:25,940 --> 04:08:26,780
Was that it?

6302
04:08:27,020 --> 04:08:28,120
Was that the after credit?

6303
04:08:29,120 --> 04:08:31,060
Bro, are those fucking limping?

6304
04:08:31,360 --> 04:08:32,660
What the fuck do I do?

6305
04:08:33,020 --> 04:08:35,620
What do I do?

6306
04:08:38,780 --> 04:08:42,160
Like, we don't have a horse doctor here.

6307
04:08:42,440 --> 04:08:45,600
I don't even know what the fuck my girlfriend can do.

6308
04:08:47,860 --> 04:08:49,200
Is this just being dramatic?

6309
04:08:49,980 --> 04:08:55,620
Is that the fact that he like swam all the way back here?

6310
04:09:02,280 --> 04:09:03,360
Wait, am I alive?

6311
04:09:05,160 --> 04:09:06,760
I'm a fucking baby?

6312
04:09:10,190 --> 04:09:10,750
Bro.

6313
04:09:14,110 --> 04:09:15,390
Still... Oh my god.

6314
04:09:15,450 --> 04:09:15,710
Bro.

6315
04:09:17,270 --> 04:09:17,830
What?

6316
04:09:18,990 --> 04:09:21,030
My girlfriend's gonna be my mom now?

6317
04:09:25,790 --> 04:09:27,930
Oh wait, is this... Oh, that's like Ico.

6318
04:09:29,130 --> 04:09:33,130
He's like the spiritual success... like the prequel to Ico.

6319
04:09:33,690 --> 04:09:34,810
Because he has horns too.

6320
04:09:35,570 --> 04:09:37,450
Bro, my girlfriend's my mom.

6321
04:09:40,630 --> 04:09:45,270
I knew... guys, I fucking knew grabbing anything was worth this.

6322
04:09:56,370 --> 04:09:57,890
I fucking knew it.

6323
04:09:59,070 --> 04:10:02,630
You guys are like, Doki, why didn't you grab anything?

6324
04:10:02,690 --> 04:10:04,630
I fucking knew there was no way.

6325
04:10:04,630 --> 04:10:05,050
Low point.

6326
04:10:05,090 --> 04:10:06,810
I saved up some time.

6327
04:10:11,430 --> 04:10:14,330
Everyone, I saw in my chat.

6328
04:10:14,610 --> 04:10:18,790
They were like, wow, this entire game was grabbing and she doesn't even grab at the end.

6329
04:10:18,950 --> 04:10:20,970
Because I knew it was useless.

6330
04:10:21,950 --> 04:10:24,010
There was no fucking point.

6331
04:10:33,510 --> 04:10:35,590
But what about the drama?

6332
04:10:35,610 --> 04:10:36,830
I should have been like, we.

6333
04:10:36,930 --> 04:10:37,130
What about the drama?

6334
04:10:37,130 --> 04:10:37,130
I should have been like, we.

6335
04:10:37,150 --> 04:10:38,870
He jumped into the pool.

6336
04:10:55,370 --> 04:10:57,010
Wait, but the bridge is gone.

6337
04:10:57,170 --> 04:10:59,430
How the fuck is she gonna get home?

6338
04:10:59,570 --> 04:11:00,870
This is so sad.

6339
04:11:01,510 --> 04:11:03,670
Like seeing Arlo limping.

6340
04:11:03,710 --> 04:11:04,550
Oh my god.

6341
04:11:05,990 --> 04:11:08,530
Bro, how the fuck do we fix his leg?

6342
04:11:19,530 --> 04:11:20,910
This is home now.

6343
04:11:23,650 --> 04:11:26,390
Yeah, I'm like how is she gonna... the bridge is gone.

6344
04:11:28,070 --> 04:11:29,630
Where are we gonna get diapers?

6345
04:11:40,440 --> 04:11:41,040
Food.

6346
04:11:44,650 --> 04:11:45,370
Kill it.

6347
04:11:53,930 --> 04:11:54,830
The deer.

6348
04:11:56,890 --> 04:11:58,630
Why is this snow white shit?

6349
04:12:03,600 --> 04:12:04,620
She's so close!

6350
04:12:05,540 --> 04:12:06,860
Kill it for food!

6351
04:12:17,640 --> 04:12:19,120
Oh my god, this is great.

6352
04:12:19,360 --> 04:12:24,140
Because like the herbivores have never seen an actual carnival before.

6353
04:12:24,160 --> 04:12:26,540
So it's like the dodo bird.

6354
04:12:28,160 --> 04:12:29,340
It's like a dodo bird.

6355
04:12:29,520 --> 04:12:32,220
Where like dodo birds never encountered any like actual...

6356
04:12:34,360 --> 04:12:35,880
Actual like threat.

6357
04:12:36,180 --> 04:12:38,880
So like it was so easy to kill all the dodo birds.

6358
04:12:39,260 --> 04:12:43,440
Because the dodo birds just didn't know what is considered a carnivore.

6359
04:12:43,680 --> 04:12:45,360
And what is considered like a predator.

6360
04:12:45,760 --> 04:12:48,340
So the deers, they don't know.

6361
04:12:48,440 --> 04:12:48,880
They don't know.

6362
04:12:48,960 --> 04:12:51,120
So we'll just wait for it to walk up to us.

6363
04:12:51,200 --> 04:12:53,060
And then like snap its neck and then that's food.

6364
04:12:53,360 --> 04:12:54,140
Because it's never eaten.

6365
04:12:54,160 --> 04:12:55,100
I've never seen a predator before.

6366
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:58,760
Eagles don't eat deers!

6367
04:12:58,820 --> 04:13:00,280
Okay maybe like baby deers.

6368
04:13:00,420 --> 04:13:03,360
I've seen an eagle pick up a fucking baby deer before.

6369
04:13:04,060 --> 04:13:06,380
Like not in real life but a YouTube video.

6370
04:13:07,100 --> 04:13:10,840
Like not in real life but a YouTube video.

6371
04:13:10,840 --> 04:13:11,900
It's not ruining the...

6372
04:13:11,900 --> 04:13:12,780
What moment?

6373
04:13:13,000 --> 04:13:14,160
It was a fucking deer.

6374
04:13:18,380 --> 04:13:19,620
You know you've seen a video?

6375
04:13:19,940 --> 04:13:22,100
Of like a fucking eagle pick...

6376
04:13:22,100 --> 04:13:25,040
I think it was like an eagle picking up a fucking baby deer.

6377
04:13:25,340 --> 04:13:25,600
I think it was like an eagle picking up a fucking baby deer.

6378
04:13:25,620 --> 04:13:26,780
It's just like...

6379
04:13:27,700 --> 04:13:28,720
There's like a thing.

6380
04:13:29,000 --> 04:13:31,720
So a lot of parents are like super paranoid.

6381
04:13:31,720 --> 04:13:33,220
Because like there's been cases.

6382
04:13:33,460 --> 04:13:35,700
Where like eagles will try to pick up children.

6383
04:13:36,160 --> 04:13:37,800
Like they will try to abduct kids.

6384
04:13:38,180 --> 04:13:40,980
Because it sees it as like a fucking baby animal.

6385
04:13:42,400 --> 04:13:42,920
Yay!

6386
04:13:57,340 --> 04:13:59,160
Yeah eagles can pick up goats.

6387
04:13:59,620 --> 04:14:01,000
Now there's a fear in there.

6388
04:14:01,140 --> 04:14:01,660
Hahaha!

6389
04:14:02,480 --> 04:14:04,100
Yay we did it!

6390
04:14:04,100 --> 04:14:06,380
Now you have an additional fear.

6391
04:14:06,640 --> 04:14:08,320
If you become future parents.

6392
04:14:08,700 --> 04:14:10,220
And then like now you're like.

6393
04:14:10,340 --> 04:14:12,360
What if an eagle picks up my child?

6394
04:14:12,520 --> 04:14:14,300
My child will never go outside anymore.

6395
04:14:16,780 --> 04:14:17,760
New fear.

6396
04:14:22,220 --> 04:14:22,800
Yay!

6397
04:14:24,420 --> 04:14:26,380
We fucking did it guys!

6398
04:14:28,060 --> 04:14:29,500
Oh my god!

6399
04:14:30,000 --> 04:14:31,740
We fucking did it!

6400
04:14:31,800 --> 04:14:33,480
We beat Shadow Colossus!

6401
04:14:34,100 --> 04:14:35,400
And press X real fast.

6402
04:14:37,140 --> 04:14:38,580
Enter attack mode.

6403
04:14:39,080 --> 04:14:40,920
Press in front of the cross.

6404
04:14:40,980 --> 04:14:41,600
A statue?

6405
04:14:42,360 --> 04:14:43,420
What the fuck?

6406
04:14:43,660 --> 04:14:44,820
Did I just beat the game?

6407
04:14:45,520 --> 04:14:47,760
Oh new game plus a mirror world.

6408
04:14:47,820 --> 04:14:49,140
What the fuck is mirror world?

6409
04:14:49,380 --> 04:14:50,260
Anyway beat the game!

6410
04:14:50,440 --> 04:14:51,220
We did it!

6411
04:14:52,520 --> 04:14:54,200
Another game completed!

6412
04:14:54,320 --> 04:14:55,640
I'm gonna turn off the game.

6413
04:14:55,980 --> 04:14:58,520
I'm gonna turn off my playstation real quick.

6414
04:14:58,780 --> 04:14:59,900
I'm gonna turn it off.

6415
04:15:00,520 --> 04:15:01,480
Oh my god!

6416
04:15:01,600 --> 04:15:02,060
Oh yeah!

6417
04:15:02,220 --> 04:15:03,120

6418
04:15:04,100 --> 04:15:05,460

Look at this guys!

6450
04:15:54,980 --> 04:15:55,540
Look!

6451
04:15:55,900 --> 04:15:56,460
So tiny.

6452
04:15:57,380 --> 04:15:57,940
Look!

6453
04:15:57,940 --> 04:15:58,320

Look at the little!

6456
04:16:04,780 --> 04:16:05,640
Look I...

6457
04:16:05,640 --> 04:16:07,640
They gave me alternatives with like...

6458
04:16:07,640 --> 04:16:10,140
The little handkerchief or like the non-handkerchief.

6459
04:16:10,280 --> 04:16:12,100
But I went with the non-handkerchief because like...

6460
04:16:12,100 --> 04:16:13,920
I felt like you know...

6461
04:16:13,920 --> 04:16:14,340
Um...

6462
04:16:14,940 --> 04:16:16,920
I wanted it to look dissimilar.

6463
04:16:17,160 --> 04:16:19,100
But oh my god and then there's me.

6464
04:16:19,320 --> 04:16:20,660
There's me over here.

6465
04:16:20,900 --> 04:16:23,520
Um... I sort of like baited...

6466
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:24,300
My friend.

6467
04:16:25,600 --> 04:16:27,220
Because like... uh...

6468
04:16:28,480 --> 04:16:29,720
Even though like...

6469
04:16:29,720 --> 04:16:31,740
I commissioned them to draw...

6470
04:16:31,740 --> 04:16:32,140
Me.

6471
04:16:32,800 --> 04:16:34,020
We're gonna get a new...

6472
04:16:34,020 --> 04:16:36,020
Skin suit so that this one's gonna change...

6473
04:16:36,020 --> 04:16:36,720
In the future.

6474
04:16:37,000 --> 04:16:37,380
Like...

6475
04:16:37,380 --> 04:16:39,300
We're not even gonna hit that sub badge.

6476
04:16:39,420 --> 04:16:40,480
It's just there for decoration.

6477
04:16:40,820 --> 04:16:43,600
I just wanted to fill it all... all the slots up.

6478
04:16:43,840 --> 04:16:45,820
But like we're never even gonna get this...

6479
04:16:45,820 --> 04:16:46,400
Sub badge.

6480
04:16:46,480 --> 04:16:47,360
Like the last one.

6481
04:16:50,220 --> 04:16:50,720
Yeah.

6482
04:16:51,500 --> 04:16:53,920
The last sub badge is gonna change.

6483
04:16:54,360 --> 04:16:55,360
And I was just like...

6484
04:16:55,360 --> 04:16:56,360
This is... Fuck it.

6485
04:16:56,440 --> 04:16:57,160
I just wanted...

6486
04:16:57,940 --> 04:16:58,800
I just wanted...

6487
04:16:59,400 --> 04:17:00,640
It's just a placeholder.

6488
04:17:01,240 --> 04:17:03,040
It's gonna... It's a placeholder.

6489
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:05,500
So the new skin suit will have like...

6490
04:17:05,500 --> 04:17:06,980
It would be different from this.

6491
04:17:07,260 --> 04:17:07,540
JP!

6492
04:17:07,600 --> 04:17:08,820

Thank you thank you.

6499
04:17:17,760 --> 04:17:23,120
Can I ask for a birthday greeting to Scarlet Ghost?

6500
04:17:23,360 --> 04:17:24,880
She's a huge fan of you, Doki.

6501
04:17:25,000 --> 04:17:25,920

6502

Of course.

6504
04:17:27,140 --> 04:17:27,340

6505
04:17:27,340 --> 04:17:29,240
Happy birthday Scarlett!

6506
04:17:29,560 --> 04:17:31,000
Happy birthday to you!

6507
04:17:31,120 --> 04:17:32,620
Happy birthday to you!

6508
04:17:32,840 --> 04:17:34,460
Happy birthday dear Scarlett!

6509
04:17:34,680 --> 04:17:35,860
Happy birthday to you!

6510
04:17:36,020 --> 04:17:36,260
Yeah!

6511
04:17:36,980 --> 04:17:37,920
Happy birthday!

6512
04:17:40,140 --> 04:17:41,720
Also another update.

6513
04:17:41,940 --> 04:17:43,280
If you guys don't follow me on Twitter...

6514
04:17:43,280 --> 04:17:46,800
So you know how like GamerSubs and I are hosting an art contest?

6515
04:17:47,940 --> 04:17:54,380
GamerSubs got back to me and they are sponsoring, funding the whole $8000 for the prize pool.

6516
04:17:54,380 --> 04:17:57,840
So like originally it was $7000 but then we decided to add...

6517
04:17:57,840 --> 04:18:00,860
I wanted to add an extra $1,000 and choose like 10 more winners.

6518
04:18:01,100 --> 04:18:03,640
Because there's been... we've recently... like I checked...

6519
04:18:03,640 --> 04:18:08,480
We've had 120 entries so far after one week.

6520
04:18:08,580 --> 04:18:15,220
And there's still like 3 to 4 more weeks left of the... 3 to 4 more weeks left of the contest.

6521
04:18:15,760 --> 04:18:18,280
So I was like, oh I want to... like I was like, oh my god.

6522
04:18:18,300 --> 04:18:19,020
And there's just so many!

6523
04:18:19,080 --> 04:18:19,780
There's so many!

6524
04:18:19,900 --> 04:18:21,480
They're all like really amazing.

6525
04:18:21,760 --> 04:18:23,640
They're all like so pretty and everything.

6526
04:18:23,640 --> 04:18:29,660
So that's why like I asked if I could add one more... 1k more to the prize pool.

6527
04:18:29,740 --> 04:18:32,340
So I can like pay more artists for all their amazing entries.

6528
04:18:32,520 --> 04:18:34,700
Because it's gonna be so hard to choose, Matt.

6529
04:18:34,980 --> 04:18:37,080
It's gonna be so hard to choose.

6530
04:18:37,240 --> 04:18:39,240
And then GamerSubs after they're like, yeah.

6531
04:18:39,320 --> 04:18:41,360
They're like, you know what Dokie?

6532
04:18:41,460 --> 04:18:44,160
We're gonna sponsor all the entire prize pool.

6533
04:18:44,320 --> 04:18:46,580
Like all $8000 of it.

6534
04:18:46,640 --> 04:18:48,560
Because at first it was they sponsored 5k.

6535
04:18:48,680 --> 04:18:51,060
I sponsored 2k to the 3k.

6536
04:18:51,260 --> 04:18:52,740
And then later on today...

6537
04:18:52,740 --> 04:18:53,620
They told me that they...

6538
04:18:53,640 --> 04:18:56,860
They're gonna sponsor like full fund the entire $8000.

6539
04:18:57,320 --> 04:19:02,860
So huge shout out to GamerSubs for the big support there.

6540
04:19:02,980 --> 04:19:06,900
For willing to like sponsor $8000 for artists.

6541
04:19:07,060 --> 04:19:08,200
It's actually crazy.

6542
04:19:08,840 --> 04:19:09,920
So crazy.

6543
04:19:11,400 --> 04:19:12,640
But yes!

6544
04:19:12,860 --> 04:19:14,380
Thank you all for joining!

6545
04:19:14,800 --> 04:19:16,620
I'm gonna fucking peace out now.

6546
04:19:16,700 --> 04:19:17,580
I'm super tired.

6547
04:19:18,700 --> 04:19:20,420
I'm very tired now.

6548
04:19:20,500 --> 04:19:21,940
We streamed for 4 plus hours.

6549
04:19:21,940 --> 04:19:23,820
So I'm gonna peace out now guys.

6550
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:25,520
Hope you guys had a great time watching.

6551

As always everybody stay hydrated.

6552
04:19:28,280 --> 04:19:28,860
Posture check.

6553
04:19:28,880 --> 04:19:30,800
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

6554
04:19:30,920 --> 04:19:32,940
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

6555
04:19:33,080 --> 04:19:34,200
Because you deserve it.

6556
04:19:34,300 --> 04:19:35,260
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

6557
04:19:35,680 --> 04:19:36,480
