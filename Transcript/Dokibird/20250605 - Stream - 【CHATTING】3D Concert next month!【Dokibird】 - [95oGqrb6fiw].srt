1
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,630
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,250
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,050
Yes, I sound very, very, very weird.

4
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:04,470
If you guys were not there for the Twitch stream earlier today, I am currently traveling at the moment.

5
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,170
So I am at a... I am not at my usual setup.

6
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,450
As you guys know, I am streaming all of this on Wi-Fi on my laptop.

7
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,030
So, it's a little... I'm not used to it at all.

8
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,230
I'm not.

9
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,890
No, I am not on vacation right now.

10
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,210
I'm actually working.

11
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,610
This is very related.

12
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:41,550
For those who didn't see the special announcement, the very, very special announcement that was announced on Saturday last week, I am going to be at Anime Expo.

13
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,690
Yes!

14
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,530
Woo!

15
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:53,370
So, I will be at Anime Expo on July 4rd, which is the day before my birthday.

16
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,810
And as you guys can see here, it says, Doki Bird Birthday Celebration Concert.

17
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,290
Yes!

18
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,290
There will be a 3D concert on July 3rd.

19
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,330
So, okay.

20
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,330
So, I'll go into, like, more in-depth about everything.

21
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,370
So, next day, thank you for the super chat.

22
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:10,610
Thank you.

23
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,050
Thank you.

24
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,870
Spilling us with Doe Kitty and Glasses.

25
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,290
Awesome.

26
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,630
Okay.

27
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,730
So, I'm going to go into in-depth about all of the stuff that's going on with it here.

28
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,810
But yes, first time watching stream... Oh my god.

29
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,870
That's an awkward moment.

30
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,990
Ha ha ha ha!

31
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,010
You're going to have, like, the scuffed audio as your first time watching.

32
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,250
Ha ha ha ha!

33
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,670
Please, check my other VODs when I have my actual setup, please.

34
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,950
Ha ha ha!

35
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:47,650
Um, I didn't want to, you know, I was, like, I thought about, like, you know, I was, like, oh, do I, uh, um, oh, am I not synced up?

36
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,190
Ha ha ha ha!

37
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:49,830
No!

38
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,450
Am I not synced up right now?

39
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,510
Oh, no!

40
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,470
Okay, I don't, okay, give me a sec.

41
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,630
I will fix this.

42
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,510
Give me a sec, guys.

43
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,350
I disappear.

44
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,120
I don't know why I'm not synced up during Twitch.

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,720
Is it because of YouTube?

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,840
Is it?

47
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Is it YouTube?

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay.

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,280
Testing.

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,420
One.

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Two.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,220
Three.

53
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,120
Why am I not synced up?

54
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,740
I don't understand!

55
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,140
I was synced up on YouTube.

56
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,400
I'm on Twitch!

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,220
Okay.

58
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,840
Um, it was unsynced during, okay, I got this, guys.

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
Okay, I'm gonna reset everything.

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,680
Um, it might just be, like, it might just be, uh, I just might just, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,180
Pop, pop, pop.

62
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,440
Okay, I'm synced up now.

63
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,120
Guys, don't worry, I'm synced up now.

64
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,940
Don't worry.

65
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,380
I'm synced up now.

66
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,360
Am I synced up?

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Yeah.

68
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,700
I think so.

69
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,420
I can't tell anymore.

70
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,680
I... I think I'm synced up now, right?

71
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,220
Yes.

72
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,540
Okay.

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,860
There we go.

74
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,580
There we go.

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,760
We're back to normal.

76
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,380
There we go.

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:04,900
Okay.

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,740
So, Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat.

79
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,080
Thank you.

80
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,760
Thank you.

81
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,980
Will there be Bloodborne 2 announcement after the concert?

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,260
Oh my god, stick to the end and maybe you'll find out if Bloodborne is still gonna be up there.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
It's slightly... Oh my god.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,300
How is it slightly up?

85
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,060
Okay.

86
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:30,700
Okay.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:30,980
Okay.

88
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,460
Give me a sec.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,220
I can fix this.

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:32,960
Okay.

91
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:33,720
Give me a sec.

92
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,840
I know how to fix this.

93
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,580
Okay.

94
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,720
Alright.

95
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,620
Disconnect.

96
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,860
Now.

97
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Connect.

98
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,540
Connect.

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,680
Hello, hello, hello.

100
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:45,980
Testing.

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,800
One, two, three.

102
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Okay.

103
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,660
I think I'm synced up again.

104
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay.

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,700
I...

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Okay.

107
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,360
I'm back now.

108
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,340
Back and back again.

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,180
Alright, sound guys.

110
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,660
My sound guys.

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,820
Let me know if the audio is okay with the BGM.

112
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,480
Okay.

113
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,180
Anyway.

114
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,980
So, I am traveling and it's very related to concert preparations.

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,280
Um, so, uh... Okay, guys.

116
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't, don't fuck with me.

117
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,080
I'm gonna think about it.

118
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm gonna keep thinking about the sync issue.

119
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,900
Um, anyway.

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,420
Um, uh, Sejan, thank you for the super chat.

121
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,660
Thank you.

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,020
Thank you.

123
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,720
No, I am currently, uh, I am currently traveling right now.

124
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,140
So, I'm using my Elgato travel mic instead of my usual mic.

125
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Um, and I'm currently streaming on Wi-Fi right now.

126
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,120
So, uh, so, yeah.

127
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,640
That's, like, I, I thought about it.

128
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,140
I was, like, okay, do I take a couple of days off or do I stream?

129
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,680
And I really wanted to stream because, um, because, like, I don't want to take more days off because I've been taking so many days off.

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,560
So, I was, like, okay, I, I stream.

131
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:08,540
I'm gonna do, like, streams that aren't game intense, like, too intensive for my laptop because I still want to, um, I still want to, like, stream for you guys.

132
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,160
I still want to be there for you guys even though I have to do, like, my concert preparation and stuff.

133
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,540
So, I know it's sad that I'm doing Deltarune with this scuffed-ass setup.

134
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,020
It'll be, like, part one.

135
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,000
Deltarune where I sound really fucking off and everything.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,660
Um, but then, like, Deltarune part two and then everything is, like, professional again.

137
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,600
I, and then, and then, and then, I don't know, I, I saw that.

138
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,660
It's a nice day of, nice day of fishing.

139
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,260
Ha ha!

140
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:48,140
Um, so, and I really wanted, I was, like, I just tried to pick games that, uh, that aren't super, like, intensive for my laptop itself.

141
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,300
So, um, so then that's why I chose those games.

142
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,160
But I hope that it doesn't... The one thing that worries me always is that I hope it doesn't deter, like, new viewers to watch.

143
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,440
It's like, oh, wait, what the fuck?

144
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,540
Why is your mic like that?

145
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,680
I'm not watching this.

146
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Like... Like, I hope that doesn't deter anyone.

147
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,120
Even though, like, it's like a double-edged sword, not streaming versus streaming.

148
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,200
Because I'm like, oh, I don't have my usual setup.

149
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,020
But I do sound, like, really... Um, I love their channel.

150
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,360
I love Viva La Dirt League.

151
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,400
I love their shit.

152
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,620
I always watch their videos.

153
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,740
Um, so I was, like, super excited to try out their new game.

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,600
Um, but, like, I hope that doesn't deter new people from checking in.

155
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,060
Be, like, their first impression.

156
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,380
Being, like, what the fuck is wrong with her sound?

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,200
Oh my god!

158
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,940
And everything.

159
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,300
Especially... I feel bad.

160
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,280
I feel bad that I'm doing... I have a nice day for fishing and I'm streaming like this.

161
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,220
Like... But I was like, I'm sorry.

162
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,500
Like, your game is, like, pixel art.

163
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,180
And it doesn't seem like it's, like, you know, 50 gigabytes of shit.

164
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,660
And it doesn't seem like it's gonna take my, like, like, 50 gigabytes of RAM and 100% of my CPU.

165
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,240
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,200
Like, it was the perfect game to stream while I'm traveling.

167
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,920
Anyway, guys.

169
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:20,880
I do have to say that, um, I have played chapter one of, uh, Deltarune, um, when it first came out.

170
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,560
Like, when, like, Bark Nights might remember this.

171
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,780
I actually streamed, like, it was, like, it...

172
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,280
I remember when it very vividly.

173
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,960
It launched on midnight or some shit.

174
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,400
And then it launched on midnight and I went straight to streaming it.

175
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
It was, like, a surprise launch.

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,500
The very first time Deltarune chapter one ever launched back then.

177
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:46,640
Um, I actually streamed it with my... for my Bark Nights all those years ago for the first release of chapter one.

178
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,800
So, I don't remember much about chapter one, not gonna lie.

179
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,940
I remember the ending of chapter one.

180
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,300
I don't remember much of chapter one.

181
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,240
Um, I bet I just, like, vaguely, like, remember some bits of parts of it when I play it again.

182
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,280
So, I have played chapter one before.

183
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,040
So, I'm not, like, going in completely blind.

184
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,120
I've never touched the future chapters.

185
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,560
Only because, like, I wanted to wait until, like, it ended.

186
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,300
But then I was like, I don't know what to stream this week while I'm traveling.

187
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,200
So, I guess I'll stream Deltarune.

188
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,580
It's coming out anyway.

189
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

190
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,540
Okay, who remembers?

191
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,700
Yes, it was very... it was, like, six plus years ago, wasn't it?

192
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,800
Deltarune chapter one was six plus years ago, right?

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,020
Um, I'm pretty sure.

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,900
Uh, it was old, old.

195
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,380
Like, people have been waiting for, like, the newest chapters for a fucking long.

196
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,240
Yeah, 2018.

197
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,380
19, 20, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

198
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
Yeah, it's been seven years.

199
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,480
Holy fuck.

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,200
It's been...

201
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

202
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,260
Chapter one was seven years ago.

203
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,380
Holy, holy, holy fuck.

204
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh, my God.

205
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,520
We've been waiting for chapter one for so long.

206
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,060
Um, Hacktuber model.

207
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,180
I think it was super chap.

208
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,520
Thank you.

209
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,260
Thank you.

210
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,720
Ha ha ha ha, Glenn.

211
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,080
Ha ha ha ha.

212
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,000
Um, now you guys gotta wait another seven years for chapter five and six.

213
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,480
Yay!

214
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,260
Yippee!

215
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

216
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,680
Anyway.

217
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,540
Um, okay.

218
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,320
Um, so...

219
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,240
Uh, I hope...

220
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,140
I hope they noticed me.

221
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
I hope Viva La...

222
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,600
I don't remember their full channel.

223
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,400
Like, I love your shows, but, like, your channel name is so long, so I always forget what it's called.

225
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,060
But, ha!

226
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,900
I just remember Viva.

227
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,720
I hope Viva notices me.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,200
Woo!

229
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,060
Ha ha ha ha ha.

230
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,280
Ha ha ha ha.

231
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,300
Viva La Dirt League.

232
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, because I love their...

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
I love their videos.

234
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,820
And I love their...

235
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,200
Um...

236
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,180
Um, I love their videos and their shorts.

237
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,620
So, um, it'll be so cool if they saw me streaming the game and be like, Oh my god, who is this?

238
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,940
Because I love their stuff.

239
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:47,820
Uh...

240
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,180
Ha ha ha ha.

241
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,260
Um, anyway.

242
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,160
Uh, what?

243
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,800
Anime Expo.

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,620
Okay, so, um, yes.

245
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,120
It was announced very, very last minute.

246
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,480
Um, because we found out very last minute that we were going to be part of Anime Expo.

247
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:13,120
Um, but I believe, like, Iron Mouse and I are both, like, the only VTubers invited as official guests, uh, for Anime Expo.

248
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,280
At first it was just Iron Mouse.

249
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,460
Uh, basically, like, they announced the panel with her and, um, C-Dawg.

250
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
And then, and then mine got announced right after.

251
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,740
I didn't even know Iron Mouse was going to be, uh, because, like, at first they told us what we were the only V, like, I was the only VTuber that was going to be, like, invited.

252
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,540
So, I think they also got in last minute because when they told me that, I was like, Oh my god.

253
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:45,400
Okay, so they gave me a panel spot at first and, um, so they gave me a panel spot and they told us, they told my staff team and I, I did not expect it, we did not expect it at all.

254
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:52,600
Like, uh, so we found out, literally during May, like, we found out we got a panel spot.

255
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,660
Um, it's now June, but that's how last minute it was.

256
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:05,480
I found out in May, like, that I got a spot at Anime Expo and they wanted to invite me as another guest.

257
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,780
So, um, I was very surprised, um, because I didn't expect it.

258
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:26,840
So, I found out in May and then I was like, I want to make it very special because, um, I was like, you know, Anime Expo, you guys don't know, Anime Expo is one of the biggest anime conventions in, uh, in America, in the U.S.

259
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,380
So, I realized that was an incredibly huge opportunity.

260
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:52,980
So, I didn't want to do just a panel because, you know, usually I just do a panel for conventions that I'm invited to, but a lot of, I heard that, like, a lot of, like, um, execs also go to, execs and representatives for different brands and different companies and stuff also go to Anime Expo.

261
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,620
So, I figured this was, like, a huge opportunity.

262
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,560
Because if you guys didn't know, even my Nendoroid was announced during Anime Expo.

263
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:17,400
So, I figured, like, this might be a huge opportunity to do something extra special because it's something, like, you know, um, there's so many, like, you know, a lot of well-known people around, um, what's the word called?

264
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,640
Around Conicreation that will be attending.

265
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,160
A lot of brands, a lot of companies will be there, and maybe they want to check out, like, oh, hey, there's a VTuber concert.

266
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,920
I've never seen a VTuber concert before.

267
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,680
Like, oh, yeah, I heard VTubers are being really popular.

268
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:39,880
So, I figured, like, this could be a huge opportunity to, like, market myself as well, especially since it is free admission, by the way.

269
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:47,260
So, um, I know there's, like, um, there's, like, other concerts going around, but, as well, but it's on venue.

270
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,760
This one is on, on venue.

271
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,580
So, it is at Anime Expo, and you do not have to pay extra for it.

272
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,140
There is just free admission.

273
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:04,760
So, you just get, just, as long as you have a ticket, uh, as long as you have a ticket for the convention, you'll be able to watch this concert.

274
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,420
You'll be able to enter, uh, the venue for it.

275
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,160
So, um, you don't have to pay anything extra.

276
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,980
Uh, you know, be like, oh, man, another VTuber concert.

277
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,660
I have to pay for it.

278
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,040
No, no, no.

279
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,380
It's free.

280
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:15,720
It's free.

281
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:26,020
And so, um, that's why I decided to, uh, I decided to do a 3D concert.

282
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,560
Um, and because of the opportunity it presented, and I, like I said, it was incredibly last minute.

283
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,680
And now, now some of you guys are like, what about streaming tickets?

284
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,260
Why aren't you, uh, dual streaming it at the same time as the concert?

285
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,880
So, there's two reasons.

286
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,760
There's several reasons why I'm not doing streaming tickets for it.

287
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,160
Um, it's because, you know, the concert itself is, uh, free.

288
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,900
So, I was like, it's not fair to make you guys, uh, pay, uh, for a free concert.

289
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:11,320
So, and then the second reason why is that the 3D studio, I've reached out and contacted to, uh, produce the whole thing for me.

290
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,740
Um, they are doing it on a very limited time frame.

291
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,900
With more, only a little bit more than a month to complete everything.

292
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,420
Um, so, because of that, um, I wanted the YouTube upload.

293
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,780
I will be uploading it on YouTube, by the way.

294
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,000
Um, I'll be uploading the concert on YouTube for free.

295
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,280
So, it's not like it's gonna be gone forever.

296
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,500
Because some people are like, oh my god, I can't believe you're making exclusive to Anime Expo.

297
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

298
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,040
It's gonna be free for everybody, um, later on.

299
00:16:48,160 --> 00:17:07,500
The reason why I'm uploading it later is because I wanted the 3D studio to be able to refine and, like, improve the concert after it, after, after it's performed, sure, after it's performed in Anime Expo.

300
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:18,400
So, it's like, it's gonna be like, it's like, you know, like the Blu-ray edition for, like, anime episode, where, like, animators, like, redraw things and touch it up and, like, redo everything.

301
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,120
Like, not everything, but make it, like, a lot nicer looking than what it was like when it aired.

302
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,180
So, it's gonna be like that.

303
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,940
Cuz, cuz, obviously, we're doing it in, like, a very tight time frame.

304
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,240
So, because of that, that's why I'm not dual streaming it at the same time.

305
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:50,140
Because I don't want you guys to see how scuffed- like, you know, be like, you know, things are clipping and, and then, like, you know, when you're watching it live on Venue, you don't notice it.

306
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:59,060
But then if you're watching it, record it, and you're watching it on, on, like, digital platform and everything.

307
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,540
It's gonna, you're gonna notice it even more, you know?

308
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,060
No, I am gonna release the Doki Bird director's cut.

309
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm not releasing the scuffed one.

310
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:21,520
Um, that's like, but, um, no, no, cuz then you guys can clip it and then make GIFs of it.

311
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,360
No, I spent my, it's my own money.

312
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,820
Um, Glenn, thank you for the super chat.

313
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,040
Thank you.

314
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,480
Thank you.

315
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,640
Will the Phantom 3 concert get the same stream in and be uploaded fully?

316
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,400
That, I don't know.

317
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,560
I, I, um, that concert was produced by Oshisparks and not by me.

318
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:50,560
So, like, all those decisions are under their organization because Min and I were just contracted as performers.

319
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,180
Um, we weren't the organizers for it.

320
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,100
So, like, we don't know actually.

321
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,540
That's right.

322
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,000
We got, like, um, we got, like, the clips very late as well.

323
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:15,700
Um, because they were, like, very busy with other stuff as well as, like, um, the, this 3D, the 3D studio that was, uh, we used for that had, was also, like, incredibly busy as well.

324
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,640
Um, so that's why we got the clips very, very, like, late.

325
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
You know, when I got the clips, I instantly uploaded because, like, we waited so long.

326
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,100
I was like, fuck it.

327
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm dropping it now.

328
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,820
Like, I was like, uh, fuck it.

329
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,440
We waited so long.

330
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm ready.

331
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,960
I'll drop it now.

332
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,620
Um, so, like, that's not under me.

333
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,100
That's under, um, Oshisparks.

334
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,420
Um, so, like, I, I'm so sorry.

335
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,180
I don't know.

336
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,200
That's why for this concert, it's all organized and paid for by me.

337
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,000
Um, there's no, like, you know, outside sponsor.

338
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,400
There's no, like, outside organization that's working on this concert.

339
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,640
Um, I am producing and organizing all of this myself and paying for it all by myself.

340
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,560
So, like, actually, you guys are paying for it.

341
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,660
Your money, your money is paying for it.

342
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,860
Even, like, for, like, special guests and stuff like that.

343
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,880
Um, I, I'm paying for all of it, for my guests as well.

344
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,340
Uh, And I won't tell you guys how much it costs.

345
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:37,820
I feel like VTuber concerts, it's sort of like, I don't care about, like, telling you guys how much it costs, but I'll tell you guys how much it costs after the concert.

346
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:52,600
So, if it looks not good, if it's, like, pretty scuffed, I'd be like, shh, but if it looks amazing, if it looks amazing, I'll be like, yeah, guys, this is how much I invested, or we invested.

347
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,420
I'll be like, this is how much we all invested.

348
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,740
But, I found out how much a concert costs.

349
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:17,840
Okay, so, um, the 3D studio, uh, the 3D studio, I, uh, contacted.

350
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,020
Um, like, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

351
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,560
I'm scared of here, how many— Ugh, shit!

352
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,840
Do you know that we could film it like the Phantom V concert?

353
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,720
I want to copy, uh, the scuff edition too.

354
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,200
Neppers.

355
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,300
Thank you for the super chat.

356
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,280
Thank you, thank you!

357
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,260
You know, it's America .

358
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,900
I can't— I can say photos... you can take photos, But, like, it's America.

359
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,080
I don't know.

360
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,280
I cannot or cannot say anything regarding that.

361
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,820
But you can take photos.

362
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,740
Legally, I'll just be like, it's America.

363
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,340
You have your amendments.

364
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,260
Kush, thank you for the super chat.

365
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,020
Thank you, thank you.

366
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,900
For the funds, thank you for the super chat.

367
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,700
Thank you, thank you.

368
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,720
Glenn, thank you for the Akasupa.

369
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,340
Thank you, thank you.

370
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,000
Free concert?

371
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,380
Well, you know what?

372
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,700
Fuck you, Hanpei.

373
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,580
Anyway, thank you for the Akasupa.

374
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,780
Thank you, thank you.

375
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,500
So, like, you know, who's gonna... I'm not encouraging anything.

376
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,340
Legally, I am not encouraging anything.

377
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,680
But, like, who will stop you?

378
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,920
I don't know.

379
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,440
Anyway, um, what was I gonna say?

380
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,400
Oh, fuck, I already lost my train of thought.

381
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh, yes, oh, yes.

382
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,480
The 3D studio.

383
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,960
So, it's not a Japanese 3D studio.

384
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,380
I'm actually, um, working with a 3D studio in, um, in China.

385
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:18,240
So, I got, I got contacts because, like, I debated on which 3D studio to work with, especially in the tight time frame.

386
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,780
Um, and I decided to go with a 3D studio in China because of Gacha Games.

387
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,640
Because, because, because of, because of Gacha Games.

388
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:46,480
And I've always felt, like, the motion capture and, um, um, the motion capture and the, just, like, you know, in, in general, just is very, very impressive.

389
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,440
Like, the animation and motion capture.

390
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:57,080
So, I decided to go to a Chinese, uh, motion capture slash 3D studio, um, for this.

391
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:04,040
And I really, I'll, I'll, I'll talk more about the studio, um, after the concert.

392
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,420
But I told them that if they do this concert really well, I will work with them for my 3D debut.

393
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,240
So, this is sort of like a test run, too.

394
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:27,100
Um, I'm, I'm sort of using it as, like, a little test run on, um, testing out various 3D studios and see how I feel about it.

395
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,580
Um, Rosie, thank you for the Akasupa!

396
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,880
Thank you, thank you.

397
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,020
Here's my part.

398
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,340
I can't travel because work, but no, I'll be cheering you on.

399
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,740
Thank you, thank you for the Akasupa!

400
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,520
Thank you, thank you.

401
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,260
I wish, I wish you guys knew about this earlier, but literally I found out about this last month, too.

402
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,340
I found out about this last month, too, so I couldn't let you guys know, um, um, earlier.

403
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,900
And, uh, and, like, you know, let you guys plan your travel trips and everything.

404
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm really sorry.

405
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,020
I know some of you guys are like, I wish I knew this earlier so I could plan my travel dates.

406
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,660
But yes, it was very, very last minute.

407
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
BiteSize, thank you for the MagentaSoupa!

408
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,820
Thank you, thank you!

409
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,940
Thank you so much, Doki, for uploading a concert for all of us that can't be there.

410
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,140
I also really hope you're able to sell the merch online.

411
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,320
Thank you for the MagentaSoupa!

412
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:15,840
Thank you, thank you!

413
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,040
Yes, there will be like... we will have an artist alley.

414
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
It was gonna be... I think it's either... I don't know if it's in the vendors or in...

415
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,780
It's not gonna be in Exhibitor, but it's either gonna be in vendors or artist alley.

416
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,840
Where we're gonna be selling merch themed around the birthday concert.

417
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
And also, like, Anime Expo merch as well.

418
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,740
Um, as a collaboration with, um, with one of the artists.

419
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,840
So, um, there will be... I'm not sure if the birthday merch...

420
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,540
The... because there will... well, of course there will be birthday merch, like...

421
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,780
Um, but that's separate from the concert birthday merch.

422
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,880
But there will be concert-themed birthday merch at Anime Expo.

423
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,280
Also, I'm just unsure if we're gonna be doing online sales for that.

424
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,620
I have to wait for my staff to let me know what's going on with that.

425
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,840
But I'll update you guys about it later, whenever I get information.

426
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,340
Um, as always, for Anime Expo, you can give me gifts and letters.

427
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,160
Um, at the concert or at the booth, basically.

428
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:19,240
So, um, obviously the funds from the merch will help as well as birthday merch and stuff.

429
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,760
So you guys want to support the concert and everything.

430
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,800
You're at the convention, you can buy some of the merch that's there.

431
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,460
Or, uh, you know, order online the actual birthday merch on July 4th.

432
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,000
That doesn't mean July 4th there's nothing special.

433
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,440
My birthday actually has a special stream that I've been planning for.

434
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,440
So, like, it's not like, you know, it's not like the birthday concert replaces, um...

435
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,720
Replaces, uh, the, uh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba the actual birthday stream.

436
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,440
The birthday concert was actually, like, so last minute...

437
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,900
Surprise!

438
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,260
We're gonna do that, too!

439
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,460
So it's like a bonus.

440
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,100
So I did have plans for something for my birthday.

441
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,500
So it's not like this was gonna take over my birthday in general.

442
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:04,260
This was, like, literally just, like, an appetizer, last-minute thing that came up all of a sudden.

443
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,880
So, that's basically it.

444
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,100
But I think that's all I want to really talk about about Anime Expo.

445
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:24,280
Like I said, there's, like, there's... oh, wait, actually, did my sound guy say anything?

446
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,880
Okay, sound guy said nothing about anything about these sounds.

447
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,140
So, I assume that sound is okay.

448
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,520
I assume sound is okay.

449
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:50,220
But, yes, I will say that... what was I gonna say?

450
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,040
I think the... okay, okay.

451
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,940
What do you mean?

452
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,700
What do you mean by that?

453
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,880
The sound quality did not... oh, he said turn down BGM, like, oh.

454
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:11,580
Oops.

455
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,980
Wait, did he?

456
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,020
Oh, my God, my filter thing didn't work.

457
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
Oh, I did not see that.

458
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,480
Whoops.

459
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,080
Okay, let's turn down the BGM.

460
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,340
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

461
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,340
Was the BGM that loud, Chad?

462
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,420
I'm sorry, I didn't notice.

463
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,560
Was it actually that loud?

464
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,740
Uh...

465
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,240
Was the... was the BGM that loud?

466
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,460
I turned it down, I think.

467
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,680
Did I turn it down?

468
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,840
Whoops.

469
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,080
Okay.

470
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,360
Alright, I turned it down.

471
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,220
A little.

472
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,340
Uh... It was fine.

473
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,040
Okay, it was in BGM.

474
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,280
It wasn't that loud.

475
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,620
A tiny bit.

476
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,160
Whoops.

477
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,460
Whoops.

478
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,080
Whoops.

479
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,280
Well, we did all that update and the BGM was too loud.

480
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,960
Oopsie.

481
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,840
No!

482
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,400
I taught for so long.

483
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Sorry, my YTC filter, I didn't update it properly.

484
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,080
So, like, yeah.

485
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,940
I forgot to... I forgot to update it properly.

486
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,120
But sound people, if you want to update me about sound, We have to do Discord.

487
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,320
Uh...

488
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,360
We have to do Discord.

489
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:35,340
Because, um... I don't have the YTC filter on correctly, uh, to see it.

490
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:35,940
Uh, alright.

491
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,200
What was I gonna say?

492
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:39,680
Um...

493
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,160
Um... It was good.

494
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,420
You know, I'm anal about sound quality.

495
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,380
You guys know that.

496
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,800
Uh... What was I gonna say?

497
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,440
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

498
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,900
Uh... I guess that's really it about, um, the 3D concert.

499
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,800
Uh...

500
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,120
But yeah, it was super last minute.

501
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,380
I have to do a dance practice.

502
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,160
And...

503
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,420
More traveling later.

504
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,640
I have to... I have to do more traveling later.

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,180
Um...

506
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,380
Leak the... No!

507
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,700
Why would I leak the guest?

508
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,160
Bye now later!

509
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,980
I think I might show a portion.

510
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,840
Um...

511
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,300
I might have to do... Uh...

512
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,160
Uh... I might show a little bit of the portion of the concert on my birthday.

513
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,180
So, like, um...

514
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,460
So, um... I will... So, like, you know, at least you guys get a little bit something.

515
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,800
Um... And then you... I'll show, like, a lit... Like, one song from the concert...

516
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,000
On my birthday before I upload the HD Blu-ray edition of the concert.

517
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,360
So, I'll give you guys that.

518
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,660
Uh... I'll... I'll...

519
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,520
I'll give you guys that as, like, a little treat.

520
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,340
Uh... Before the Blu-ray edition shows up on my channel.

521
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:18,500
But yeah, that's really it about what's going on for Anime Expo.

522
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,100
And how it's going for it.

523
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,940
So, I do hope everything looks nice.

524
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:35,060
The examples they showed me for like the concerts they produced looked really, really, really good.

525
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:45,560
Like, not concerts, but like, I guess like the 3D stuff they've done before on Billy Billy, looked really, for other VTubers, looked really, really good.

526
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,380
So I was like, ooh, you know?

527
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,900
I was like, ooh, well, well, well, well, well, well.

528
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,520
This seems like a good opportunity to work together.

529
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:56,620
Yay!

530
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,300
So I hope, I hope my concert looks just as good.

531
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,100
That's all I hope for.

532
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,080
That looks just as good as the examples they showed me.

533
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,980
Especially with the tight timeframe that they have.

534
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:24,220
But yeah, I've been like, bouncing around a lot, and been bouncing around a lot everywhere.

535
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,560
And just, oh my gosh, I'm all over the place.

536
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,820
I, like, my staff has been like, oh, remember to do this, remember to that.

537
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,160
And I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm working on the concert right now.

538
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,800
They're like, oh, remember, remember this, remember, you need to do it.

539
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,940
I'm like, I'm like, I'm sorry.

540
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,420
I'm, I'm literally traveling right now.

541
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,040
I have so little time.

542
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,600
I have time, I'm sorry.

543
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,660
Um, hee hee ha ha.

544
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Yeah, we need two dokis.

545
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,320
But yeah, I do hope, for those who are traveling to Anime Expo, that you guys will enjoy the concert.

546
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,860
And the, the, like, and it's watchable.

547
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,280
That's my hope.

548
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,480
And, um, and then that looks good.

549
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,960
And when I, when I get the Blu-ray edition of it, that it also looks pretty neato as well.

550
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,760
Um, but yeah.

551
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,260
Um, and that, my singing won't be that bad.

552
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,140
I hope.

553
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,860
Um, Glenn, thank you for the super chat.

554
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,160
Thank you.

555
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:37,620
Thank you.

556
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,740
Does the Blu-ray come with bloopers?

557
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,880
I don't know.

558
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,980
I don't know.

559
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,940
Maybe, maybe I'll show bloopers and stuff.

560
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,980
Like, and, um, extra recorded stuff.

561
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,800
Like, on, after the concert.

562
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,560
After it, I upload the, maybe after the concert, maybe.

563
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,180
I don't know.

564
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,340
Maybe I'll show, like, extra recorded goodies and stuff after the concert.

565
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,400
Or, like, on the birthday stream.

566
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,100
And I'll show you guys that, maybe.

567
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,040
But, yeah.

568
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,760
Oh, yes.

569
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,840
The 3D upload of Last Cup of Coffee came out as well for Mint and I.

570
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,480
I'll tweet about that, too.

571
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,180
My social media stuff is, like, all over the place as well.

573
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,780
Like, I'm all over the place in general.

574
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,220
I need to tweet out about it.

575
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,920
I did not tweet out about it.

576
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,900
I just made a premiere room and then I disappeared.

577
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Hey, disappeared!

578
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,640
And then I reappeared right now and just got fast set up.

579
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,120
But I always want, like, I always love streaming for you guys.

580
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,720
Even though, like, I know, like, it might have been better to just wait until I'm back home.

581
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,360
I still wanted to, like, keep you guys company.

582
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,420
And I did take a lot of breaks this year.

583
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,000
Like, and I feel like, I don't want to take another break.

584
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,840
I don't want to take another break.

585
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,980
I want to stream.

586
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,300
I want to talk to you guys.

587
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,480
I don't want to do...

588
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,700
I don't care if I don't have my actual setup.

589
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,980
I want to stream it and everything.

590
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,660
Powerball, thank you for the super chat.

591
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,000
Thank you.

592
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,520
Thank you.

593
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,940
Thank you for your hard work.

594
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,920
I'll definitely visit AX to celebrate your birthday.

595
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,720
I'm so excited.

596
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,640
Thank you for the super chat.

597
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:18,940
Thank you.

598
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,580
Thank you.

599
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,160
Um, I really appreciate it, guys.

600
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:28,920
I really appreciate you guys traveling to Anime Expo to watch this, um, but yeah, um, what else, what else?

601
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,700
I wrote, like, stuff.

602
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:50,700
Oh, I went to, I went to an arcade, um, recently, during my travels, and, um, um, I won, you know, like, those creating games and stuff, so they actually, so one of the arcades I went to, uh, they imported, like, uh, the, um, actually not rigged, not rigged,

603
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,460
uh, hand, hand cranes, or UFO catchers, so I actually, I'm coming back with some plushies, too.

604
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:12,980
I brought, I was like, I knew bringing an empty suitcase was the right, I have one suitcase, guys, that's not, I only, I only have one suitcase, and it's, like, literally, it had, like, almost nothing in it.

605
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:24,660
All I had, did was, like, I brought, like, um, um, I brought, like, uh, my clothes, and, like, my life, my streaming setup, and it was, like, so empty.

606
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,420
Like, it was like those giant suitcases, too.

607
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,260
Like, those, like, the ones that are, like, up to more than half your height.

608
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,500
And then, so, like, I was like, that's my only suitcase!

609
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,080
And I'm like, thank God!

610
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,420
Thank God I brought this big suitcase for a reason!

611
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,460
And it's for plushies!

612
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,780
Always for plushies!

613
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah!

614
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,720
So, um, so yeah, that was nice!

615
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,860
It was a nice experience!

616
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,100
What else?

617
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,060
I wrote, like, stuff I want to talk about.

618
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,280
Oh yeah!

619
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,800
Also, is the BGM better now?

620
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,440
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

621
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,960
Oh!

622
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,020
Speaking... Oh yeah!

623
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:12,760
And then, like, I actually wanted to do Super Mario-mon while, um, I wanted to do Super Mario-mon while I was, like, you know, traveling.

624
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,120
And I was so fucking stupid.

625
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:25,280
Because I didn't realize the save file was saved on a different location.

626
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,800
All I did was like... I was like, okay, I got the emulator.

627
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,700
And then I got the Super Mario Mon game.

628
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:45,980
And then I save both of that in my external hard drive.

629
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,640
I boot it up.

630
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
And I was like, New game?

631
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,600
And I was like, New game?

632
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,620
What do you mean?

633
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,620
New game.

634
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,820
Where's my save file?

635
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,020
Where could it be?

636
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,840
And I googled, I was like, where is save file?

637
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,600
And they're like, it's in a different location.

638
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,740
And I'm like, what do you mean it's in a different location?

639
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,660
Yeah, so don't worry.

640
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:20,520
By the time I'll be back for Super Mario Mon at home.

641
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,900
So do not worry.

642
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,000
I will be back at home by the time I play Super Mario Mon.

643
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:35,500
By the time I play Super Mario Mon, I will be able to play on the actual save.

644
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,300
File, so I will be back in time.

645
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,580
I made sure of that.

646
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,220
I was like, looking through my schedule, I was like, oh, fuck, okay.

647
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,140
I was so upset.

648
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,480
I was like, no, this might have been the perfect time.

649
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:57,540
Okay, if I actually had my save file for Super Mario Mon, my entire week would just be Super Mario Mon.

650
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,700
We won't be playing Delta Room.

651
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,020
We won't be playing Nice Day for Fishing, huh?

652
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,420
We'd just be playing Super Mario Mon, because at least I could get that game done.

653
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,200
While I'm, while I'm out here fucking traveling.

654
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,780
Like, I brought a fucking... I brought an Xbox controller for no reason.

655
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,940
I'm, I'm like, I'm like, to be fair, my suitcase was big enough to fit the Xbox controller.

656
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,920
But I'm like, I didn't need to bring my Xbox controller.

657
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,060
I...

658
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,280
I could have used this boy!

659
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,800
Mario!

660
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,800
We, we don't get toot, boys!

661
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,640
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

662
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,980
Thank you, thank you.

663
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,980
Um, sounding more insane by the second.

664
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:01,940
Um, um, why you sound like you're in church, cause I need to atone for my sins.

665
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm actually at, I'm actually at the Vatican City, because I've sinned too much, that I need to, I need to see the new Pope to forgive me.

666
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,400
Where is Doki Bird San Diego in Vatican City?

667
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,240
Right, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

668
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,840
Toad voice is getting scarily accurate.

669
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,140
Um, oh yeah, for those who are wondering, I did not apply for Sage Imsdam.

670
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,860
Uh, I know some people are like, oh my god, no I did not, I, I did not, I'm, I'm way too busy.

671
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:49,780
I, I, I, I'm also like, I will, I honestly, I would only do Sage Imsdam again, if Kony was there.

672
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,060
Um, because like, I want Team Brawl Pope back, like, yeah!

673
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:07,520
I heard Kony wasn't doing it, I, I wasn't doing it too, so, also I found, like, I saw that they were saying like, um, there were so many people returning too.

674
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:20,040
Like, 30 plus people, uh, signed up for, um, so, 30 plus, 30 plus, 30 plus ex, uh, Sage Imsdam players were coming back for it.

675
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,220
So like, I don't know, I honestly, I also don't want to take a spot from someone who's new.

676
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:31,320
Because like, what makes these competitions more fun is to see like, new faces in general.

677
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,620
Um, and I think that's what makes the competition more fun.

678
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:43,320
Because you get to see new interactions, and, um, new participants, and like, uh, meet new people and stuff like that.

679
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,880
So like, also, I didn't want to take a spot because there's so many like, uh, people coming back.

680
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:57,080
Yeah, but there were 600 entries, but when, if you're a person that want to return to Sage Imslam, you get a guaranteed spot.

681
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:05,460
Um, uh, you get a guaranteed spot for the next Sage Imslam if you're a return player, from what I'm told.

682
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,900
Um, so if you want to come back, you, you will, you can, basically.

683
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,700
Like, uh, Sage Ims usually doesn't turn people away if you want to do it again.

684
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:23,020
Um, I heard that he, maybe they're, I don't know, I saw on Twitter, Sage Ims was saying how they're, he's inviting, making more teams for it, to accommodate for the newer players.

685
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:30,580
Um, yeah, I assume like, because like, you know, they're, they're coming back, so you know how they work and stuff like that.

686
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:37,260
Uh, uh, but yeah, so I also want to give a spot for like, newer players to join in and stuff like that.

687
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,740
Because, y'know, I've already done 2 Sage Ims slams.

688
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,900
Um, I already made, I dunno, I w, I feel like I already made an impact on Zangief, and I already made an impact on King!

689
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:56,140
So like, I feel like I'm, I don't know, for some reason I don't know how, I m, how, like, me on Zangief made such an impact on Street Fighter.

690
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,580
I HAHAHAI!

691
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,940
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing!

692
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:00,560
Um!

693
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:02,980
HAHAHAHA!!!

694
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:17,320
So like, I don't, I feel like, I don't know, I feel like I don't think I could ever outmatch whatever, um, outmatch whatever the fuck I did on Zangief there.

695
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:40,080
Like, I don't think I could ever top what I fucking did when I was on Zangief, like, like, everyone actually trained to, like, everyone tried to train against me and learned, like, all how to counter me and everything.

696
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,000
It was crazy.

697
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,220
I was like, oh my god, what the fuck?

698
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,340
Bro, I'm so tired.

699
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,440
Like, because I skipped, I literally skipped one day of training.

700
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,740
I skipped one day because I was going fucking crazy.

701
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,100
Like, you guys don't understand.

702
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,800
I was going fucking crazy with all these practices.

703
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:07,500
And I skipped one day of practice because I needed a break.

704
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,640
I could not do, I could not play more.

705
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,160
And it was over for me.

706
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,460
They, like, learned so much just to counter me.

707
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,480
Just because, like, um, it's because I was, like, what, undefeated, right?

708
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,860
I, I, like, not, I, was I undefeated?

709
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,120
I remember, or I lost, like, one game or some shit, um, during, like, one of the rounds or something.

710
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,060
And then during, yeah, and then they all, like, studied me after that.

711
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,960
Like, like,

712
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,380
yeah, yeah, yeah, I went undefeated on the second day.

713
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,360
And then I, everyone just studied what I did and everything to the point.

714
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:59,120
And then I, and then I skipped one day, one fucking day of not practicing because I just, I wanted to play something else.

715
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,120
I would have gone crazy.

716
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,100
I would actually have gone insane if I had to play more.

717
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,000
I was so tired.

718
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,240
I was, I was so fucking tired.

719
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,980
I hated it.

720
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,580
That, like, I just, I quit it.

721
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:27,420
And I think skipping that one day actually, like, cost me because everyone was still fucking practicing.

722
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:46,140
I, but yeah, I don't, um, I don't, I don't think, uh, Uh, I don't think I could have, I honestly do not think I could have, I could have topped that Zangief performance.

723
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,300
Especially when I heard, especially when I heard that they nerfed the fuck out of Zangief right after.

724
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,520
I don't, like, Zangief was my boy.

725
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,120
But I don't think I could play anybody else.

726
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,400
Like, because he was the one that you, because he was the one that you played that to tell people.

727
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:10,200
And, like, I only play characters that, like, honestly, like, like, I want to play characters that would, like, just get you tilted.

728
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,340
Like, I, like, a rage bait character.

729
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,320
Like, I just, I just want to, I want to play characters that are rage baitable.

730
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,980
Like, like, so I feel like, you know, I don't know.

731
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,380
Zangief is just, Zangief and King, it just hits that spot.

732
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,000
Like,

733
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,220
they, they, it just hits, you know?

734
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,240
It just, it's just, it just hits.

735
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:44,420
And, like, I don't know if I get, if I do Zangief I'm slamming and I don't know if there's a character that just hits like that, you know?

736
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,300
That just gives that same vibe.

737
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:56,580
That gives the same, like, grapple, like, like, same, oh my, like, when you lose to it and, like, you get hit by one move.

738
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,520
Just all it takes is one move and it, they mentally boom.

739
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,300
And, like, those are the characters I like, because I remember that moment.

740
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,700
Next day, thank you for the super chat that you think, when I was playing King, um, for the Tekken State Jam Slam.

741
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,340
And I was watching VODs of, like, um, of, like, the POVs of the people I fight.

742
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,160
And they're, like, this is bullshit.

743
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,060
This is...

744
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,120
One move!

745
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,540
One move!

746
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,080
Takes away so much of my HP!

747
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,860
Just one move!

748
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,320
And, like, that's what makes me happy.

749
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:40,100
Like, that's honestly, like, and the, like, just one move can make you mental boom.

750
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:46,460
And, like, I like those types of characters, like, and my loyal fans and the alley kicks.

751
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,760
Like, and yay!

752
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,500
Oh my god.

753
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,460
I still can't believe...

754
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,040
Like, I need, I like to play characters that do that.

755
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,360
Like, the characters that are just fun to, like, fuck around with.

756
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,160
Um, uh...

757
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,540
Let's see.

758
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,840
Duck, thank you for the super chat.

759
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,780
Thank you, thank you.

760
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,520
You mind-breaking Saikuno and 1-in-dangumi was my highlight this time.

761
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,680
Thank you for the super chat.

762
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,100
Thank you, thank you.

763
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,440
Um, and I have zero defense.

764
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,500
Why defend when you can just attack?

765
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,780
Like, that's how I remember.

766
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,000
That's how I played...

767
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,700
That's how I played King and Zanky.

768
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,540
I literally just go attack, attack, attack, attack.

769
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,540
Because why...

770
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,220
Why defend when you can attack?

771
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,280
Why defend when you can grab?

772
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,660
Exactly.

773
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,180
Um...

774
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,380
Forward, thank you for the super chat.

775
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,080
Thank you, thank you.

776
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,760
It just hits...

777
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,280
She says, as she air grabs an opponent one foot off the ground.

778
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,640
I just keep...

779
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,520
Thank you for the super chat.

780
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,240
I told you, like...

781
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,900
That's what I live for.

782
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,580
I'm here.

783
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,480
I remember, like...

784
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,360
I saw that clip with Ludwig.

785
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,160
Like, that's what made me follow him, finally, on Twitter.

786
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,640
Um...

787
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,740
But he doesn't follow me back.

788
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,180
But he knows I exist, apparently.

789
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,080
Um...

790
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,800
Where he was, like...

791
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,540
Where he was saying how, like...

792
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,700
I am the one that just wants the cheese.

793
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,140
I don't care about actually learning the game.

794
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,060
I just want to win by sheer cheese.

795
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,960
I just...

796
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,220
I just want to...

797
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,000
I just want to win by cheese and rage bait.

798
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:35,860
Who cares about actually learning the mechanics and, like, the game itself.

799
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,980
When I can just win the game by doing one or two moves.

800
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,700
Because that's literally how I played King.

801
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,320
I learned one to three...

802
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,160
Like, I learned three moves on King.

803
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,800
And it was alley kick, grab one, and grab two.

804
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,960
And then I mixed in some button mashing in between.

805
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,380
That's literally the three moves I learned.

806
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,360
And then when you do grab one, make sure you do the...

807
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:02,860
The...

808
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,360
This button...

809
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,520
One button or the second button.

810
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,500
And...

811
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,500
And then on Zangief, it was the same.

812
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,520
I learned four moves on Zangief.

813
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Because apparently you can't button mash in Street Fighter.

814
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,280
And I don't remember those four moves.

815
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,500
I remember.

816
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,340
Grab one and grab two.

817
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,420
And then whatever.

818
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,180
I don't remember the other two.

819
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,480
I don't remember.

820
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,580
Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

821
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,360
Thank you, thank you.

822
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,260
Oh, and yeehaw.

823
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,040
Yeehaw.

824
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,580
Yeehaw.

825
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,340
Is this why Dookie's ear is yellow to cheese in all the games?

826
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,560
Thank you for the super chat.

827
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,640
Thank you, thank you.

828
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,640
But yeah, that's basically it.

829
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,120
Mike, thank you for the super chat.

830
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:55,880
Thank you, thank you.

831
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,540
Frame data?

832
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,560
I only know.

833
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,120
Cheese.

834
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,040
Thank you for the super chat.

835
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,240
Thank you.

836
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,320
Oh yeah, drive impact.

837
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,400
And then drive impact.

838
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,380
Defend?

839
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,700
The fuck is that?

840
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,080
As long as I hit one grab, I need to hit two grabs and he's dead.

841
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,000
Like...

842
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,640
Exactly, I didn't pay $70 to learn how to defend.

843
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,480
Blocking is for fucking cowards.

844
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,820
I know my tier.

845
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,260
I'm in a beginner's tier for a reason.

846
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,240
Beginners don't need to learn how to block.

847
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,780
But yeah, maybe if like...

848
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,000
I don't know.

849
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,360
Maybe Seacham does a new game.

850
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:47,760
Maybe.

851
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,100
Because like...

852
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,140
I do...

853
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,680
I don't know what the fuck neutral is.

854
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,000
I don't fucking know.

855
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,820
It goes in one ear and out the other.

856
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,480
Like, I don't fucking know.

857
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,400
I don't retain information.

858
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,380
The tournament has been...

859
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,520
Guys, the tournament has been over for like half a year.

860
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,520
It's time...

861
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,380
Of course I didn't retain anything.

862
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,400
I have a...

863
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,620
I have limited hard drive space.

864
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,980
I need to delete things when things are over.

865
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,100
So I can...

866
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,720
I can know new things.

867
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,880
Guys, thank you for the Magenta Supa.

868
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,260
Thank you.

869
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:23,960
Thank you.

870
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,780
On top of Tekken...

871
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,740
Did you know Bamco replaced the whole Tekken balance scene because last season was a disaster?

872
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,000
Thank you.

873
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,500
It was a Super Chat.

874
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,140
Thank you.

875
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,960
No, I didn't know that.

876
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,040
I don't keep up with fighting games, to be fair.

877
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,660
The times I do keep up...

878
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,120
You know, when it shows up on my Twitter feed or like...

879
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,340
You know...

880
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,080
Yeah, usually like the fighting game stuff is just when they shows up to my Twitter feed.

881
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,900
I don't really keep much up to date about fighting games in general.

882
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,100
I heard about that new...

883
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,860
Well, I saw the new Marvel...

884
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,900
I almost said Marvel Rivals.

885
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,160
I saw that new Marvel fighting game that trailer dropped.

886
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,680
That shit looked so fucking cool.

887
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,840
That shit really...

888
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,900
It looked really, really cool.

889
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,180
Um...

890
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,140
There's something I wanted to talk about, but I forgot.

891
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,160
Ah, fuck.

892
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,140
It was on my mind when I saw that Super Chat.

893
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,880
Ah, what was it?

894
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,540
What was it?

895
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,160
Ah.

896
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,320
What was it?

897
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,080
Oh, man.

898
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,260
Ah.

899
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,820
Ah, I'm trying to remember.

900
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,540
I'm trying to remember my limited hard drive space.

901
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,520
See, this is what happens.

902
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,760
I can't believe you guys filled up my hard drive space, guys.

903
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,400
I can't...

904
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,260
No!

905
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:44,340
I wanted to talk about something that clearly wasn't important, I guess, because I already forgot what it was about.

906
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,440
Yeah, thank you for the Super Chat.

907
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:47,740
Thank you.

908
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,320
Thank you.

909
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:55,200
I fear not the man who practiced 10,000 moves once, but I fear the man who practiced one or four moves 10,000 times.

910
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,320
Thank you for the Super Chat.

911
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:56,740
Thank you.

912
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,300
Thank you.

913
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,820
Oh, my God.

914
00:53:59,360 --> 00:53:59,620
No!

915
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,060
My hard drive.

916
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,580
No!

917
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,040
Oh, my God.

918
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:05,840
Oh, my God.

919
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,380
What was it?

920
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,620
It was something I wanted to talk about.

921
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,300
Fuck!

922
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,360
Ah!

923
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,120
Okay.

924
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,720
Give me a sec.

925
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,460
I'm trying to think.

926
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,040
I'm trying so hard to think right now.

927
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,960
Was it Tekken related?

928
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,720
Oh, my God.

929
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,460
Aw.

930
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,740
Aw.

931
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:22,940
Think.

932
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,640
Think, Doki, think.

933
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,520
God damn it!

934
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,480
God damn it!

935
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,720
Okay, it's something related to video games.

936
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,340
Zahnerman, thank you for the super chat thingy, thank you.

937
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:47,280
And for some god damn ungodly reasons, Yann does, ever does a Smash Bros, you should pick up Dwarf and put terror into people who can't play against them.

938
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,980
Thank you for the super chat thingy, I'm gonna fucking play Steve, what the fuck?

939
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:56,460
I'm... Why play Ganondorf when I can play Steve?

940
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,320
Every time I do a move, I can be like Chicken Jockey.

941
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,580
That's the correct thing to do.

942
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,740
He's a band, can't band this, how dare you?

943
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,460
I am for the people, the people wanna see Steve.

944
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,580
Johnny Lacone, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

945
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,540
We need a Brain Expansion slot, fun.

946
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,040
It's really hard to play.

947
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:35,360
I would learn Steve just because I heard that people do not want it.

948
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,160
I heard Steve is like really tilting to play against.

949
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,080
That's why I feel like Steve is really...

950
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,480
would be, Steve would be the one.

951
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,140
Yes, Sid.

952
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,660
He's tilting and he's top tier.

953
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:52,920
You will try...

954
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,200
Yeah, but I feel like the...

955
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,280
But I feel like if I learn the base mechanics of Steve, then I can...

956
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,540
And I'm in the beginner division, it's over.

957
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,720
It's over for them all.

958
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,680
I feel like Steve is like the noob destroyer.

959
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,920
He seems like a rage bait.

960
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,300
He seems like something I can use to rage bait people.

961
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,340
I just need to know how to mine and craft.

962
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,160
Minecraft.

963
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,180
Minecraft.

964
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,380
God, I wish I remembered what I wanted to talk about.

965
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,520
God fucking damn it.

966
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:43,960
Fuck.

967
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,940
God, I'm so mad.

968
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,320
Now I'm getting rage baited.

969
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,680
I'm rage baiting myself.

970
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,460
I'm...

971
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,100
Because I'm like, what was it?

972
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,320
What did I want to talk about?

973
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,920
I wanted to tell you guys.

974
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,680
I get rage baited by your own.

975
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,780
It's something related to gaming.

976
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,220
It was like on the topic of fighting games.

977
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:19,340
And it was on the topic of fighting games and like Tekken.

978
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,720
Because like...

979
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,260
Like that like set off something in my head about something else.

980
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,620
And I don't remember.

981
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,580
Fuck.

982
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,760
Okay, give me it guys.

983
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,300
I'm thinking.

984
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:30,860
I'm thinking.

985
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,520
No, I talked...

986
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,960
I just talked about the Marvel fighting game too.

987
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,000
I just talked about it.

988
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I'm thinking.

989
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,020
I'm thinking guys.

990
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,520
Ah, what was it?

991
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,380
Ah...

992
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,320
Like it was something to do with Tekken.

993
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,660
But it wasn't about Tekken.

994
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,460
But it led me to a different topic.

995
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,760
And now I...

996
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,520
It was like...

997
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,560
Ah, it's like those fleeting thoughts that just disappear.

998
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:56,840
Because...

999
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,620
Because like...

1000
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,380
Uh...

1001
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,060
No, it wasn't about Armor King.

1002
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:02,760
No.

1003
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,180
No.

1004
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,920
It wasn't.

1005
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,560
Ah, I guess we'll never know.

1006
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,660
The one that got away.

1007
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,260
Guys.

1008
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,840
It could have been a cool topic too.

1009
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,040
It could have been such a cool topic.

1010
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,400
The one that got away.

1011
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,000
Chat.

1012
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,660
The one that got away.

1013
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:24,740
Yay.

1014
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,720
Roku, thank you for the super chat link.

1015
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,360
Thank you.

1016
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,280
Uh...

1017
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,620
Oh no.

1018
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,080
Yeah, I know about the new Marvel fighting.

1019
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,240
We were watching...

1020
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,160
Um...

1021
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,980
We were watching the state of play today.

1022
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,660
This morning.

1023
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,500
So...

1024
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,540
It was really interesting.

1025
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,200
There was a lot of interesting games.

1026
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,620
Um...

1027
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,900
I'm looking forward to the James Bond game.

1028
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,380
And...

1029
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,420
Um...

1030
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,460
I guess that's...

1031
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,200
Hmm...

1032
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,560
I mean, all the other games were already announced and stuff.

1033
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,240
So...

1034
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,420
Oh, I want to play Jump Force.

1035
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:57,900
I...

1036
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,500
Someone...

1037
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,080
I...

1038
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,400
Jump Force is actually a game I really want to play.

1039
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:01,880
Oh!

1040
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:02,900
Oh, I remember.

1041
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,540
I remember.

1042
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,940
Because Capcom contacted me.

1043
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,740
After I played Onimusha.

1044
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,380
Because I think I was like, you know, the...

1045
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,900
One of the few streamers that were actually streaming Onimusha.

1046
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,040
But Capcom contacted me.

1047
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,080
And they wanted to send me a Onimusha merch package.

1048
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,160
And everything.

1049
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,620
So I was like, yay!

1050
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:29,080
Because I think I'm like, one of the ten people that actually stream Onimusha.

1051
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,200
But I love Onimusha!

1052
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,860
Like, I don't know.

1053
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,000
I wish...

1054
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,180
I wish Onimusha was more popular.

1055
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,120
Because it is such a good game.

1056
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,640
It's so camp...

1057
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,000
Like, the voice acting...

1058
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,780
For two is so fucking ridiculous.

1059
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,040
I legitimately did not remember much of two.

1060
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,420
It's like, sand land all over again.

1061
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,160
Yay!

1062
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,700
But it's like, actually, it's so campy.

1063
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,240
And I love the voice acting.

1064
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,260
And like, the what the fuck that's...

1065
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,120
What the fuck shit that's going on.

1066
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,980
In Onimusha 2.

1067
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,860
Onimusha 1 was not like this.

1068
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:15,300
I...

1069
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,280
I think Onimusha 1 reminded me more of Devil May Cry.

1070
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,180
Um, but Onimusha 2 was like, what if we just add a metal horse?

1071
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,580
Like, what if...

1072
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,020
What if...

1073
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,120
A metal horse and then, like, Mr. Nimbus?

1074
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:31,800
Um...

1075
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,500
He he he!

1076
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,040
He he he!

1077
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,140
Um...

1078
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,780
The random robot horse.

1079
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,360
Out of fucking nowhere.

1080
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,640
And a metal fish.

1081
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:44,600
Um...

1082
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,980
But yeah, they're sending me a little care package.

1083
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,480
Uh, for their merch though.

1084
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,620
Because they enjoyed the stream.

1085
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,840
And I'm like, yippee!

1086
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,600
I love Capcom!

1087
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:54,520
Yay!

1088
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,440
And they were really nice about it.

1089
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,960
They're like, oh, we want to send you a little merch kit.

1090
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,500
And everything.

1091
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,140
And like, um...

1092
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,980
It has like a jack...

1093
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,720
I don't know what's in it.

1094
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,620
I just know it has a jacket.

1095
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,200
I...

1096
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,500
I have so many jackets now.

1097
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,620
I am from like, different games.

1098
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,700
I have like, Monster Hunter jacket.

1099
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,460
I have a Monster Hunter jacket.

1100
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,120
I have like, Wukon jackets.

1101
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,120
And I have an Onimusha jacket.

1102
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,900
Like, I have so many fucking jackets from so many different games.

1103
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,940
I don't have to buy clothes anymore.

1104
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,760
I actually don't.

1105
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:25,280
I...

1106
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,100
That's the best part.

1107
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,460
Like, I love being content creator.

1108
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,660
Because I don't have to buy clothes anymore.

1109
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,200
I just...

1110
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,220
I just...

1111
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,520
If you send me free shit, I just...

1112
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,580
I guess I'll just wear it in line.

1113
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:41,580
Yay!

1114
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,880
I don't need to...

1115
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,140
I don't need to buy clothes anymore.

1116
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,200
I just need to buy pajamas.

1117
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,060
Oh yeah, speaking of pajamas...

1118
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:50,780
Um...

1119
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,220
The...

1120
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:51,760
Uh...

1121
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,620
The Gina and Draws collab...

1122
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,120
Pajama set is...

1123
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,480
I'm a walking ad.

1124
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:57,220
Hey!

1125
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,440
It was...

1126
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,600
Free is free.

1127
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,360
Okay?

1128
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,320
Okay?

1129
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,820
Um...

1130
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,500
Um...

1131
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,420
Anyway...

1132
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:10,600
What was I...

1133
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,980
Uh...

1134
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,840
What was I, uh, what was I saying?

1135
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,320
Uh... Ah, fuck.

1136
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:18,980
Uh, free.

1137
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,360
How expensive is your... But, yeah, anyway.

1138
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,780
Uh... Yeah, free is my favorite word, guys.

1139
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,700
Uh... But, yeah, the pajamas are coming in now.

1140
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,200
I saw some people taking photos of it and everything already.

1141
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:34,960
We tweeted some.

1142
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,120
But it looks really comfy!

1143
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,380
It looks really comfy.

1144
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,880
I love the sleep masks, too.

1145
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,520
So I'm glad.

1146
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:40,440
I hope people are...

1147
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,700
Um, apparently all the shipment... Everything has been shipped now.

1148
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,560
Um... So, and, like, uh... So I hope you guys get them soon and everything.

1149
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,580
Um... But, yeah, I'm really excited.

1150
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:57,020
Uh... I'm really, really excited about, uh... All the new stuff that's coming in and everything.

1151
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:57,720
Oh, my God.

1152
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,780
I'm so... Uh... Busy, busy, busy, busy.

1153
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,240
After this stream, I have to go back to work.

1154
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,020
Go back to concert stuff.

1155
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,320
And, um... Back to concert prep stuff.

1156
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,420
And also, like, other things.

1157
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,400
Like, you know, my actual birthday stream and stuff like that.

1158
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,260
Um... Ugh... Just a lot of things going on behind the scenes.

1159
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,840
Um... But, yeah.

1160
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,820
I think that's really all I want to talk about today.

1161
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,620
I'm sorry it was, like, such a short stream today.

1162
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:34,780
Um... But, uh... Since I'm traveling, I can't really do, like, super long streams.

1163
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,120
I'll try and do, like, a two-hour...

1164
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,580
What?

1165
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
Two-hour Deltarune stream tomorrow.

1166
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,300
Um... Wait, it's Deltarune, right?

1167
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,800
At least two hours tomorrow.

1168
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,220
We'll see if we can finish chapter one tomorrow.

1169
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,580
Um... Even though I'm replaying chapter one.

1170
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:49,640
Um...

1171
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,220
Let's see if we can finish chapter one.

1172
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,880
And then, like, you know, the second part next week, we'll do more...

1173
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,400
More and more, um... Longer Deltarune playthrough when I have my own setup again.

1174
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,480
But I hope you guys enjoyed, uh... Hearing me yap for an hour today.

1175
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,300
Um... The time... I was... I did stream on Twitch for an hour as well.

1176
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,840
So, technically, it's a two-hour stream.

1177
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:10,740
Anyway, guys.

1178
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,040
I'm gonna head off now.

1179
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,520
It was a great time hanging out with my dragoons, as always.

1180
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:21,500
Um... I hope you guys enjoy, um... Um... Like, hanging out with me.

1181
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,480
Even though, um... The setup is... It's a little scuffed.

1182
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,540
Um... But you guys refilled your dokium.

1183
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,140
As next you say, thank you guys for the superchat.

1184
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:29,440
Thank you.

1185
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:29,940
Thank you.

1186
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,520
Matty, thank you for the superchat.

1187
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,000
Thank you.

1188
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,120
Thank you.

1189
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,940
That you sent treats for it.

1190
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,320
Yes!

1191
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:33,820
I did!

1192
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,800
I retweeted something!

1193
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,800
Thank you guys so much!

1194
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,480
Oh, yes.

1195
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,280
Dad is at a new sitter.

1196
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,920
Uh... A newer sitter this time.

1197
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,760
Because my usual sitter can't, uh... Take care of Dad.

1198
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,780
Uh... So then we're trying a new sitter.

1199
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,320
And, like, uh... She's been, like, sending me pictures and videos of, uh...

1200
01:04:53,320 --> 01:05:03,880
So, oh yes, by the way, I gave her like a bar collar, but it has no battery because I got worried that... Okay, so this is dad's new thing that he likes to do.

1201
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:12,960
He tries to trick me into feeding... Okay, so... Oh wait, that's not new, but he's been realizing that sometimes it works because sometimes I'm really, really tired.

1202
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,800
So he's been tricking people.

1203
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:19,480
He's been trying to trick me into feeding him early in the morning.

1204
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:38,700
So I got worried for my new city because I'm like, worried because like, you know, she could be an easy mark for him that... So, so I was worried and like, apparently she lives with roommates and obviously I didn't want to, you know, inter... like, yeah,

1205
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,500
I didn't want to like, like, make it bad.

1206
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,080
Like, you know, that you have to sleep and stuff.

1207
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:51,760
So, so, so I was like, here is his bar collar.

1208
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,340
Like, like, that has no battery in it, but when he sees it, he'll understand.

1209
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,940
Like, he'll be like, oh, fuck.

1210
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:03,000
Like, because he doesn't want to risk it actually being on.

1211
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:08,380
So like, so like, every time I use the bar collar, because it hasn't, I haven't used that in like years.

1212
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:14,120
So like, he hasn't had, he... I've only used it when he was, uh, when we were training him.

1213
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:21,380
When we first, not when, not like when he got older and he realized that like, barking lets him get things.

1214
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,640
And then that's when I was like, okay, so it's like, like PTSD.

1215
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:31,900
So, um, so like, I've only used it for like, during like, that short moment of his life.

1216
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:36,000
Like, but he knows, every time I bring it up, he knows.

1217
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,300
Like, and he like listens.

1218
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,060
Like, the conditioning lives on.

1219
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:43,600
So like, it's been years since that bar collar has ever had battery in it.

1220
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,880
But like, it's still, he knows.

1221
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,440
He actually knows what it does.

1222
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:51,620
So he doesn't want to risk it actually ever being on.

1223
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:58,300
And so, he, he doesn't want to risk it.

1224
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,500
So I gave it, like, I gave it to her just in case.

1225
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,400
Like, just in case, dad was like, she's easy, Mark.

1226
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,480
She doesn't know.

1227
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,440
She doesn't know my actual schedule.

1228
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,900
She's new.

1229
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,740
So I was like, if he ever wakes you up at six in the morning,

1230
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:23,220
just, just show him this and he'll be, he will go back to his bed.

1231
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:34,480
So, um, so yeah, I do get like, photo updates ever so often.

1232
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,440
Um, just ruin his whole operation.

1233
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:44,080
Um, and like, you know, told her like, the medication, like what he needs for his medication and everything.

1234
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,920
Um, and, um, also, yes.

1235
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:48,620
Oh my gosh.

1236
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,520
Someone says overstuffed wiener dog.

1237
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,160
Okay, wiener dogs come in either two sizes.

1238
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,280
Fit as fuck or, or fat as fuck.

1239
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,520
That is luckily not.

1240
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:10,560
It's also one reason why, like, so many wiener dogs also have, like, um, back problems too.

1241
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:17,420
Because they're just, they're just like, they're, like, dad, thankfully, is a fit wiener dog.

1242
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:23,700
Um, the dude, he's, yeah, ripped her fat fuck.

1243
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,380
Like, it's one or two.

1244
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:29,700
And I do not want dad to be a, to be a fat fuck.

1245
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:35,160
Because I want, because, okay, the reason why I'm not, I'm not fat shaming him.

1246
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:40,240
But, it actually fucks with the, with, with like, the ankles.

1247
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,020
Because they're short, you know?

1248
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,480
They're really short.

1249
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,480
So, like, there's not a lot of muscle on their legs.

1250
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,120
You know?

1251
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,620
And, like, he's already broke his back.

1252
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,160
I am not putting more trauma onto him.

1253
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,280
I, I'm not.

1254
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,860
They're really tired.

1255
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,480
Like, their legs are not that long.

1256
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,300
They cannot hold up so much weight.

1257
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,820
Like, yeah.

1258
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,480
So, I'm trying to make sure he continues to say, ripped ass fuck.

1259
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,780
He is gonna be a grandpa dog.

1260
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:14,680
A grandpa.

1261
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,100
He will age to be a grandpa wiener dog.

1262
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,180
And he's still gonna be, like, those ripped ass fuck grandpas.

1263
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,380
Like, you know, those ripped, like, those, like, um, those grandpas.

1264
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,260
Those, like, grandpas that somehow have six packs and all that muscles.

1265
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,080
He will be that grandpa.

1266
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,220
Okay, guys?

1267
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:32,800
I cannot.

1268
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,820
I need his legs to keep on working.

1269
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,920
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

1270
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,160
Thank you, thank you.

1271
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:44,820
Okay.

1272
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:45,700
Alright, guys.

1273
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,440
I'm gonna head off now.

1274
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,520
Anyway, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

1275
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,380
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1276
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,340
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

1277
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,860
Cause you deserve it.

1278
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,620
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1279
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,880
Bye, guys.

1280
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:58,620
Bye.

1281
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,620
Also, I still don't forgot.

1282
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,380
I still forgot to do an ending stream.

1283
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,900
So, I'm just gonna put the starting screen in there.

1284
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,460
I'll have the ending stream tomorrow.

1285
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,460
I just, I knew I forgot something.

1286
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,080
I spent so much setting this up.

1287
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,420
Like, setting up this little vacation spot when I'm not on an actual vacation.

1288
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,720
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

1289
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,280
Bye.
