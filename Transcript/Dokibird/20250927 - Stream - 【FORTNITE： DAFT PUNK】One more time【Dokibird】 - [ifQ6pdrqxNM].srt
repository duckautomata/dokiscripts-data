Queuing up the Death Punk.

112
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,600
Okay, so I don't remember if I told you guys the story, the origin of my Death Punk love.

113
00:16:40,260 --> 00:17:03,700
But the reason why, like, how I got it, like the lore of how I got into Death Punk is because, I downloaded the app Tap Tap Revenge on the iPhone and one of the free songs you get was Technologic.

114
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,480
So I was playing Tap Tap.

115
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,380
And I kept playing Technologic over and over again.

116
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,260
And I was like, man, this song is so good.

117
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,200
I was like, whoa.

118
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,080
I was like, who sang this song?

119
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:50,640
This song is so fucking good and it was it was technologic it was technologic and that's how i got introduced to daft punk yeah i was a i was just i just love that song so much it was it was life-changing um oh my god hello my fellow daft punkers oh my god he's like oh by the way i own that necklace you see the I actually,

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm sorry, Tomah, but I just, I don't know.

130
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,560
There's just something about him that, I don't know.

131
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,220
I think he was my favorite member in Daft Punk.

132
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,760
I don't email it again.

133
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,340

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,800

142
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,140

214
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:19,050
Don't distract him, he's so real for this, he's just aura farming right now, he waited his entire, entire life for this moment.

215
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,850
Return to the Slab.

216
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,550
The mysterious monolith.

217
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,170

220
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,790

Oh my god, I'm so excited.

222
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,550
Ah!

223
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,450
I read a little bit of spoilers, like the leaks and stuff, of like what to expect in the Daft Punk experience.

224
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,070
But apparently, like, because it's several rooms that you get to visit.

225
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,230
And the first room is, like, a, the recreation of Alive 2007.

226
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,230
So I'm so fucking excited.

227
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,490
I'm so jealous of everyone, of anyone that got to experience Alive 2007.

228
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,050
Because I remember seeing, like, videos of it and the stage design.

229
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,250
It looked so cool.

230
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,850
Like, it had to be, like, a life-changing experience.

231
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,550
And I'm getting this in Fortnite.

232
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,970
Fortnite.

233
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,570

234
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:28,610

258
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,450
We can't explode.

00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,130
No, we just got here.

260
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:24,910
No!

261
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,080
Not the trauma!

262
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,770
Why would you give me PTSD?

263
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,110

264
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720

Okay, we're lagging a little bit, which is a little fortunate.

This in VR would be insane though.

01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:50,910
The concert, if Fortnite re-uploaded the whole event and if

01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:14,090
Oh, they're dead.

676
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:15,430
Oh, they're dead.

677
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:16,970
It's just me.

678
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,630
I'll never know.

679
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:25,650
Wait, I like this one.

680
01:32:25,670 --> 01:32:26,350
I'm going to use the blue.

681
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:29,710
I'm remixing right.

682
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:31,030
right now.

683
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,810
I don't care if this doesn't work.

684
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:42,720
That's on him.

685
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:43,320
He died.

686
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,800
Literally remixing with my shooting.

687
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,780
Oh god, there's so many.

688
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,420
Are you not entertained, my robo overlords?

689
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,820
Oh my god, it's way five.

690
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:29,760
I've been a few.

691
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,220
Oh.

692
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:41,210
Yeah, why would I ever swap from the blue?

693
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:45,790
Other than the fact that it kills the reds a little faster.

694
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:48,290
The blue is just a better option!

695
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:56,130
Oh my wait.

696
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:14,650
stuff here oh my god my my overlords don't want me to have this understandable you're right

697
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:48,830
oh my god I just want to hear the robot I don't care about that fucking beat holy shit they're lining up wait where did these guys come from.

698
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:50,290
Oh, they're stuck here forever.

699
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,390
Wait, they're still alive.

700
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:58,810
They're just crawling in.

701
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,510
They're crawling listening to my jab.

702
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:06,250
He can't leave.

703
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:09,350
They're forced to listen to my jab.

704
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:21,170
I care about this jab.

705
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:25,850
Oh my god.

706
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:28,390
Why is there not more blues?

707
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:30,010
I'm...

708
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:32,570
Look at my ribs!

709
01:35:36,370 --> 01:35:38,190
I can't help them!

710
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:47,040
I'm just surprised they're still alive!

711
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,420
I thought they were dead!

712
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,400
I thought they were... I thought they left!

713
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,840
Why are they still here?

714
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:57,940
They're stuck here forever listening to me jamming.

715
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,360
I'm just trying to give them a good experience.

716
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,340
Oh, it's not my fault.

717
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:16,660
The rest takes like 20 years.

718
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:20,080
Is that him?

719
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,020
Don't worry!

720
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:21,980
I got you!

721
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,940
Who are...

722
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,780
I'm sorry, it's too late.

723
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:34,220
It's too late for you, but I can still live on.

724
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,520
You gotta keep crawling.

725
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,760
It's too late for you.

726
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,060
I live in your memory.

727
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,220
I can't believe he's still here.

728
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,520
Does he know how to leave?

729
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,900
The other guy even know how to leave?

730
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,180
Is he still here?

731
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,380
Let's check.

732
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:25,740
He's gone.

733
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:26,620
He finally left.

734
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:27,900
I think.

735
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,240
Unless he's like crawling somewhere else.

736
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:37,100
Oh my god.

737
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,860
I feel like.

738
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:40,700
Alright.

739
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:41,180
The moat.

740
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:41,860
Did it repeat?

741
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:42,600
I don't remember.

742
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:43,840
Oh my god.

743
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,240
Oh my god.

744
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,060
I'm just a one man crew right now.

745
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,400
Hot rod.

746
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:56,920
Oh my god.

747
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,700
The combo.

748
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,060
Oh my god.

749
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:01,620
There's a group.

750
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:02,140
John.

751
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,500
Green yellow high.

752
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,860
A green heart green yellow.

753
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,100
Got it

754
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,140
We are solo player shit

755
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,170
My team died so fast.

756
01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:42,850
I don't even know how they died.

757
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:51,770
I'm only I just I feel like I could get to the next wave So easily if I had an actual team The song repeats.

758
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:52,070
That's it.

759
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:52,510
Kill me.

760
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:55,150
I'm over this.

761
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:58,390
It loops.

762
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:01,610
I'm done.

763
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:02,650
I'm done.

764
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:03,710
I'm done.

765
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:05,390
It's 20 waves.

766
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:07,830
We're not getting to the 20 wave.

767
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:15,030
I survived eight waves by myself.

768
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,290
I'm like, I'm done.

769
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:35,890
When it started looping I was like it's over how many we're missing two more rooms right or is it just one room left purple

770
01:39:51,080 --> 01:40:08,820
basement it's below the stairs like how they're just like sitting there oh are these NPCs oh yeah I was like I was sitting here and it's just an NPC.

771
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,280
Oh, here you go.

772
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,320
Select this, okay.

773
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:21,980
Hello.

774
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,860
It's so tiny.

775
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:31,820
This.

776
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:32,680
Hello.

777
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:36,540
Alright, go around, no around.

778
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,960
Own Lego version of the iconic music video.

779
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:44,680
Wait.

780
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,960
Do all these dances?

781
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,820
Oh my god, I'm getting them silent.

782
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:57,860
I did a macarina.

783
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:58,300
Hello.

784
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,100
Hello, you want to do a macarina?

785
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,860
I'm doing a macarina, Lego.

786
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,300
That's so cute.

787
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,200
That's actually so cute.

788
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,290
Lego that fuck.

789
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,010
I wish that was real.

790
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:20,890
Hello.

791
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:24,410
How do we make...

792
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:27,110
How do we make a song?

793
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:36,390
Find and place dancers to bring the music video to life.

794
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:43,550
Don't worry, little one.

795
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,590
You're safe now.

796
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:58,610
I will save you.

797
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,720
Now you will be a dancer now.

798
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:07,940
I got you.

799
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,040
I got you little bit.

800
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:10,960
You can hear me though.

801
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:13,260
I got you, little boy.

802
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,480
You shall dance for me now.

803
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,540
Yeah, we're building around the world.

804
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,440
The world around the world.

805
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,060
Oh my god, there's a plat.

806
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,180
Yeah, I know.

807
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,440
Oh my god, there's a statue.

808
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,200
Two more.

809
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:51,340
Got you.

810
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,380
You shall go around the world.

811
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:55,800
My little one.

812
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,090
Here we go.

813
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:29,920
Oh my god, we can collect more stuff.

814
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:33,480
Look at them girls.

815
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,660
They're walking around the world.

816
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:39,660
Dance in front of them.

817
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,800

818
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:59,460

That, oh my god, my little truck.

826
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:47,090
Oh my god.

827
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:49,030
Look at all the Lego dancing.

828
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:53,150
And you have to sell.

829
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:55,550
Oh my god, John has food!

830
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:01,310
And I'm like, look at this.

831
01:46:01,310 --> 01:46:02,870
I have to look at the...

832
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:03,450
No, no.

833
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:04,810
Boogie down.

834
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,260
Oh my god.

835
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,260
I love all the Lego.

836
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:14,500
emotes.

837
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,720
H-O-T-T-O-G-O.

838
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,380
Was it the glitter one too?

839
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,900
I can't believe I have Lego animation for all of this.

840
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,440
That's so funny.

841
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:36,440
Oh I even, I'm ripping it on the guitar too.

842
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,320
I like how I could do the macarina.

843
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,020
I'm very easily entertained.

844
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,420
Down the world.

845
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:57,820
Down the world.

846
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,140
Keep going around the world.

847
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,080
Never stop.

848
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,600
I will make you a star, baby.

849
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:04,700
That's right.

850
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,620
Keep walking.

851
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,300
Yes!

852
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:13,680
I'll make you a star.

853
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:17,080
You'll be famous.

854
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:26,420
I'm back to the death mode.

855
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,300
experience.

856
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,360
The last room just replaced the intro cinematic.

857
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:09,990
Was that one more time?

858
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:12,970
Wait, let me in, let me in, let me in.

859
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:14,390
Where am I?

860
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:15,490
Where am I?

861
01:48:15,530 --> 01:48:15,870
No!

862
01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:16,910
My bad fuck!

863
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,830
My bad fuck down!

864
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:24,130
Where am I?

865
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:28,430
I don't know where I am.

866
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:31,390
But this is beautiful.

867
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:34,090
How did I get here?

868
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,690
Got it.

869
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:36,010
Oh.

870
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:40,050
Oh, this is re-experience.

871
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:41,970
I literally glitched into here.

872
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:42,750
What the fuck?

873
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:45,030
Oh, this has to be the intro, right?

874
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:48,230
This is re-experiencing the...

875
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:50,030
I'm in the secret matrix level.

876
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:51,850
I don't know how I got there.

877
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:54,410
I got the backstage pass.

878
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:57,830
Oh, this is the last room, right?

879
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:04,250
What?

880
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:06,630
I'm stuck in the daft room.

881
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,680
And this is the best concept.

882
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:12,760
Fortnite has ever done.

883
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,360
I don't think I've ever experienced.

884
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,760
Like, the fact that this whole experience has been crazy.

885
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:31,900
I'm so happy.

886
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:42,980
Also, I like, I think, like, the first time they, because I'm not lagging anymore, so I'm pretty sure the first time they did this, like, everything was just overload.

887
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,460
There were so many, I think it was because, like, so many people were in the server, too.

888
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:12,000
no i'm still i changed the settings

889
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,740
but it's still the same i just changed from epic to high

890
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:47,920
i have such a beautiful experience oh it's so boring i'm so sad i'll never even though they'll never get back together to be disappointed and keep on coping.

891
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:51,480
I'm happy that Fortnite did this.

892
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,500
I'm so happy Fortnite did this.

893
01:51:58,600 --> 01:51:59,820
It's been so fun.

894
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:08,710
I can't believe they made me relive trauma, though.

895
01:52:09,110 --> 01:52:11,010
They made me relive my PTSD.

896
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:21,990
When I had to pick up Tomah's fucking helmet.

897
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,610
Like no, not again.

898
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:28,910
You can't do this to me.

899
01:52:30,030 --> 01:52:31,910
Alright, it's time.

900
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:37,390
Around the world, around the...

901
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:39,250
It's time to do what I wanted to do.

902
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:58,180
World, around the world, around the world, around the world, around...

903
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:08,800
I don't know.

904
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:17,850
Make it.

905
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:18,750
Do it.

906
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:19,890
Peace us.

907
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:22,130

01:53:31,470 --> 01:53:32,550

Because I'm not lagging anymore.

927
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:20,240

01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,500
Well, I mosaic it right now.

949
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:37,600
I just don't think it'll be, like, a good quality picture of the tweet.

950
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,280
But, alright.

951
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:40,700

And then the thing I wish they could do,

959
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:55,700

Alright.

961
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:16,730
The technology we have today would have made this concert even crazy.

02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:26,030

I'm so happy.

989
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:53,480
All right, I think, I want to keep, I want to stay longer, but I'll be here forever.

Before we go.

1002
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:35,280
We gotta do one last time.

1003
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:36,680
One more time.

1004
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,820

I'm fucking cooking.

1019
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:16,280
I could be rowing.

1020
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:20,480
I love that punk so much.

1021
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:22,940

02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:28,060

1023
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,300
love that punk.

1024
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,840
And how sad I'm this guy.

1025
02:09:57,820 --> 02:09:58,680

02:10:05,780 --> 02:10:07,100
I like how the disclaimer.

1031
02:10:07,860 --> 02:10:10,420
They were like, they're not getting back together, by the way.

1032
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:13,620
They're like, please.

1033
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,580
Keep your expectations low.

1034
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:18,120
They're not actually getting back together.

1035
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:20,140
And I'm like, don't say that.

1036
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:22,320
Don't say that.

1037
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,780
I think I saw the disclaimer.

1038
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:28,380
They're like, they're not kids.

1039
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:31,540
Yeah, I was just like, don't say that.

1040
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:39,000
Give us a little why must you hurt us like this?

1041
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:42,800
Like, stop coping.

1042
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,400
This was such a great experience.

1043
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:56,360
It was truly a Daft Punk experience.

1044
02:10:57,180 --> 02:11:05,780
The fact that they recreated a live 2007 for those who never ever got to experience it was crazy.

1045
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:11,560
Whoever came up with that idea, he or she should get promoted.

1046
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,300
That was honestly the best.

1047
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,460
Like, for the event they've ever done.

1048
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:20,720
Kiko, thank you for the Magenta Supa.

1049
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:21,980
Thank you, thank you.

1050
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:23,560
Thanks for the jam session.

1051
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:24,460
I was doing the jam.

1052
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:25,180
I see you having me.

1053
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,260
Hope that I keep doing it.

1054
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:26,960
Thank you.

1055
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:30,040
Thank you for the Magenta Supa.

1056
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:31,560
I'm glad to make you happy.

1057
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:33,200
I'm so happy too.

1058
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:43,540
The fact that I feel like the concert they did had to be, like, the longest one.

1059
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:44,560
for.

1060
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:55,820
They use so much of their music.

1061
02:11:56,260 --> 02:12:09,820
You know, like during the interviews, like the the previews and the interviews and stuff about the event, they're like, oh, it doesn't seem like they're going to include much of their older songs.

1062
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:14,680
But they included so they included almost all their songs in their old albums.

1063
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,760
I was so happy.

1064
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:25,960
Yeah, they were like, oh yeah, in the They're like, oh, they're just get lucky and around the world, like stuff like that, and they're like, oh, it's just most of the collab scams and stuff.

1065
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:27,360
I was like, no, what?

1066
02:12:27,880 --> 02:12:31,180
Oh, they have so many good songs.

1067
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:32,740
And then it was bait.

1068
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:34,380
It was a bait and switch.

1069
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:36,800
Oh my God, they lied to us.

1070
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:42,300
They actually lied to us.

1071
02:12:42,660 --> 02:12:43,920
And I am so happy.

1072
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:59,640
I was like, oh man, I'm sad that they won't include their classics but um I love their creatives because I was like please I want Technologic please oh I'm so happy they had Technologic too oh it's

1073
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:24,140
not a regular concert and I was like oh but they lied it was a live 2007 tour I'm so happy I'm so happy they lied because I came in with lower expectations also the intro was fucking insane The intro and the intro was crazy.

1074
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:26,500
Oh my god.

1075
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:30,080
Oh my god, wait, I want to watch the intro again.

1076
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,080
I want to watch the intro again.

1077
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:33,060
It was so good.

1078
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:35,560
We have to watch the intro again.

1079
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:36,920
It was so good.

1080
02:13:37,180 --> 02:13:38,480
The intro went so high.

1081
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:39,480
We'll end it with the intro.

1082
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:43,440
I think the intro is just fucking crazy.

1083
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:48,940
I was so coped for a live 2007.

1084
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:53,200
They still make, like, guests.

1085
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,240
It's not the same.

1086
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:56,400
They make, like, surprise appearances.

1087
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:59,340
But it's, like, it's not the same.

1088
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:04,740
I didn't come here for Daft Punk to be a guest.

1089
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:06,200
I want a soul.

1090
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:06,980
I want...

1091
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:10,000
They deserve to be the main guest.

1092
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:11,680
The main performance.

1093
02:14:11,900 --> 02:14:13,740
I don't want them to be an add-on.

1094
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:15,640
They deserve better.

1095
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:20,740
It was so good.

1096
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:21,460
Oh, my God.

1097
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:47,360
For those who missed the intro, it again oh my god this was so beautiful with the with the reflection on my helmet too and we're about to go around the world and then the the crescendos they'd be like come take my hand i'll take you i'll take you to someplace special i'm like please let me leave this world i'm ready I will be ready.

1098
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:49,960
I want to live in that punk's world.

1099
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:52,640
It's so beautiful.

1100
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:04,000
She's like, take my hand and I'll free you.

1101
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:09,180
I'll free you from all the stress.

1102
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:43,240
Take my hand and you don't have to suffer anymore and live in this cruel world.

1103
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:44,700
I'll take your hand.

1104
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:46,940
I'll take it.

1105
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,140
Take me away.

1106

I want to be free.

1107
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,080
No, Toki, don't go.

1108
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:14,740
Save me, anime woman.

1109
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:44,980
Too bad for the people that got raptured.

1110
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,640
You gotta miss out on pink.

1111

02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,040
Goodbye, stranger.

Save me.

1120
02:18:25,490 --> 02:18:27,250
That was a death and death punk.

1121
02:18:27,510 --> 02:18:29,090
You're the punk and he's the death.

1122
02:18:30,690 --> 02:18:32,330
Blue woman, come back.

1123

1124
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:07,610
I'm back here oh we don't get to wear the helmet again I just noticed that

1126
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:31,790
I was like, not again.

1127
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:34,550
No, I don't want to relive this.

1128
02:19:37,650 --> 02:19:39,510
Yeah, I played everything.

1129
02:19:40,110 --> 02:19:40,870
That was great.

1130
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:41,930
I'm so happy.

1131
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:42,670

Honestly, what the fuck?

There's a bouncy.

02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:49,470
There's a bouncy here.

1135
02:19:49,570 --> 02:19:50,390
That's funny.

1136
02:19:52,310 --> 02:19:53,470
And then...

1137
02:19:53,470 --> 02:19:54,550

uh magister thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i really was an amazing surprise seeing a sub china morning documentary thank you the super chat thank you oh i was so nervous for those who don't know I got interviewed by one of the Hong Kong's,

1142
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,040
oh my gosh, it's so loud.

1143
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:40,220
I know you guys can hear me.

1144
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:57,980
But I got interviewed there, and I was very, I was very, like, nervous and scared about it because it was a big publication.

1145
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:05,280
I'm happy that I didn't even watch the video because I'm too embarrassed

1146
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:20,840
I'm too embarrassed I didn't watch the video itself but uh yeah the scmp interview yeah I'm I'm glad people enjoyed it

1147
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:42,300
Oh, I even know who they interviewed.

1148
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:42,980
That's the thing.

1149
02:21:43,580 --> 02:21:51,600
They didn't show me the video until it was published because they're like, oh, we wanted to make sure the integrity of everything.

1150
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:56,000
So, like, you know, like to make sure no one was showing the video until it was published.

1151
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:58,560
Or, like, shown what's in it until it was published.

1152
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,180
Just because they're, like, journalistic.

1153
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:15,540
So like in case like we don't influence on like how it's being edited or anything So so like they're like it's live now and I was so nervous like I hope I hope I said okay things Like I don't remember what I said.

1154
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:26,120
I think like I got interviewed like I think like a month ago or something So I didn't even like remember what I said or what like what was the contents of the interview so
